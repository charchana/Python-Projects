Albom makes a visit to his former home town in New Jersey, where Rabbi Lewis has served a congregation for about 50 years. Albom doesn't feel worthy, especially since he is no longer a practicing Jew and, in fact, he has married a Christian (who apparently isn't active either). Nevertheless, Rabbi Lewis says he is the one to do the job, and over the next eight years, Albom makes several visits back home and even attends some Sabbath services, where the good rabbi is determined to continue working and inspiring his flock even as his health declines.","popularity":0.107909,"poster_path":"/mpo0aMbRiVjO3FkASiIQHD6MrPO.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions","id":9027}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Have a Little Faith","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":4,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1002,"character":"Henry Covington","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910becf9","id":2975,"name":"Laurence Fishburne","order":0,"profile_path":"/mh0lZ1XsT84FayMNiT6Erh91mVu.jpg"},{"cast_id":1003,"character":"Donnie","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910becfd","id":34,"name":"Mykelti Williamson","order":1,"profile_path":"/8TTxzpuvvpw2tB8xZBCDslYupNU.jpg"},{"cast_id":1004,"character":"Mitch","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed01","id":11367,"name":"Bradley Whitford","order":2,"profile_path":"/66brylvzWLg94TRMd6QFrVyMOei.jpg"},{"cast_id":1005,"character":"Rabbi Albert Lewis","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed05","id":2641,"name":"Martin Landau","order":3,"profile_path":"/ylT7pqkcPNsHloe2dJsePFSoIkE.jpg"},{"cast_id":1006,"character":"Annette","credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910bed09","id":15563,"name":"Anika Noni Rose","order":4,"profile_path":"/86MzqmhiyoJmiE8U2W0HK504mEL.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910becef","department":"Writing","id":936211,"job":"Writer","name":"Mitch Albom","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe49f89251416c910becf5","department":"Directing","id":18250,"job":"Director","name":"Jon Avnet","profile_path":"/ckcE5lD7KNCh6iYHwCbfbs4r2y2.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"usa","title":"Hallmark Hall of Fame: Have A Little Faith"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Damit ihr mich nicht vergesst"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"zh","iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"普通话","english_name":"Mandarin"},{"iso_639_1":"tr","iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Türkçe","english_name":"Turkish"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"pt","iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Português","english_name":"Portuguese"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
