Shortly before his wedding day, East German Stephan Busemann goes to West Germany to attend his brother Hubert's fiftieth birthday. At the same time, his son Martin and his daughter-in-law Bettina flee their communist home country in a balloon, what Stephan didn't know. As the East Germans believe he helped them to escape, he isn't allowed to return, so Martin writes a letter to the country's leader Erich Honecker. However, now the West Germans think that Stephan is a spy.","popularity":0.000465,"poster_path":"/eRiPefTg9vSKBBufA7IMWsigcZu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heimweh nach drüben","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Stephan Busemann","credit_id":"54a735e6c3a3680c210003d3","id":67546,"name":"Wolfgang Stumph","order":1,"profile_path":"/730mEL2hmAftGFWqXfX1ds6AzX8.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Eva Linde","credit_id":"54a736119251414d5d000399","id":4792,"name":"Katrin Sass","order":2,"profile_path":"/xnXEz2KIzZGn0P46LAWYpW2iYdf.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Hubert Busemann","credit_id":"54a7361ec3a3680c1c000384","id":10923,"name":"Jürgen Tarrach","order":3,"profile_path":"/fXIh3fjLIoxqU0LdyPeANUEtJcu.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Martin Busemann","credit_id":"54a7362bc3a3680c25000353","id":6266,"name":"Steffen Groth","order":4,"profile_path":"/qM8tgZrfxP28PMbhZX7gl0mwf2m.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Bettina Busemann","credit_id":"54a7363bc3a3680c210003e5","id":25432,"name":"Winnie Böwe","order":5,"profile_path":"/6H6tgmfYLwUdtWHjcZ9tLaAuCNy.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Kurt Hempel","credit_id":"54a736b49251414d670003b1","id":44384,"name":"Bernd Michael Lade","order":6,"profile_path":"/t8XHUKCQXcZPecr1jE38WxHbrsy.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Renate Giering","credit_id":"54a736c39251414d6000037a","id":1293,"name":"Franziska Troegner","order":7,"profile_path":"/lCuV1knsruWXG3JEsyJPJkFpjII.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Stasi-Mitarbeiter Strassmann","credit_id":"54a736d1c3a3680c2b0003a3","id":31643,"name":"Udo Schenk","order":8,"profile_path":"/3hSjt1GAANVJzQVGrktDR9mx54H.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Anwalt Dr. Spies","credit_id":"54a736dcc3a3680c300003e3","id":8801,"name":"Rolf Kanies","order":9,"profile_path":"/sTcgax98lVq7j8LK3wAINUYzO2b.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"CPD-Vorsitzender Wilfried Ahlert","credit_id":"54a736e99251414d70000384","id":17546,"name":"Peter Fitz","order":10,"profile_path":"/rbEFnWlS2ZuUfwTcpxCTWkAAPF4.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"SED-Genosse Scholz","credit_id":"56e1e57e92514178940001ad","id":23112,"name":"Günter Junghans","order":11,"profile_path":"/iAezi9szRfkhZI8rchux4SSuXJO.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"540e1bd5c3a36835d60004e7","department":"Directing","id":221265,"job":"Director","name":"Hajo Gies","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
