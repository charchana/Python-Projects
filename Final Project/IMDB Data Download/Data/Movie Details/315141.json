In addition to facing poverty, deprivation, and prejudice, the immigrants are also bedeviled by a raging fever epidemic. Finally achieving a measure of prosperity, the Italians are forced to confront tragedy once more when their grown children march off to WWI. Though Isa Miranda is top-billed, she has very little to do in comparison with male lead Filippo Scelso. Passaporto Rosso was released in the U.S. as Destiny Unknown.","popularity":0.000268,"poster_path":"/8OUtM470JCCdj6wA2rBtEvLHiWl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destiny Unknown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a59a3e9251411d5300f6d6","department":"Directing","id":232144,"job":"Director","name":"Guido Brignone","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
