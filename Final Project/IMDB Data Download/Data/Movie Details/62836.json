This is history through personality - the tangled relationships through which paint a picture of one of the most turbulent periods of the modern age. Viewers will be upstairs at the White House, not in the Cabinet Room. Through iconic events in history - the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the civil rights struggle, the mob connection - viewers will learn about the lesser known, yet critical personal stories.","popularity":0.137538,"poster_path":"/lA2bHgZ76ORcc6ilfT6ax6rJBg1.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Asylum Entertainment","id":4382},{"name":"Muse Entertainment Enterprises","id":6438}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kennedys","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":9,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"John F Kennedy","credit_id":"52fe468fc3a368484e097647","id":17141,"name":"Greg Kinnear","order":0,"profile_path":"/agOTbOC76I6rC7TPuCTquvngXRu.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Jackie Onassis","credit_id":"52fe468fc3a368484e09764b","id":3897,"name":"Katie Holmes","order":1,"profile_path":"/eYeE0Z1sOvqxt7LsQHK30vUfWaM.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Bobby Kennedy","credit_id":"52fe468fc3a368484e09764f","id":12834,"name":"Barry Pepper","order":2,"profile_path":"/xLVueyLs2MERkS9RxERa3VCn95s.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Joe Kennedy Sr.","credit_id":"52fe468fc3a368484e097653","id":207,"name":"Tom Wilkinson","order":3,"profile_path":"/4mxZKgdem0sQ8hJd0Y7TREwq7TJ.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Rose Kennedy","credit_id":"534aafc5c3a3682e07001950","id":346352,"name":"Diana Hardcastle","order":4,"profile_path":"/hl58zPrWbo1mfatgVxEnGsKGZ1b.jpg"},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Ethel Kennedy","credit_id":"534aafecc3a3682dfe0018b9","id":34915,"name":"Kristin Booth","order":5,"profile_path":"/mBsmw3d19f5VLv9dYM51MHWo3Ro.jpg"},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Agent Abraham Bolden","credit_id":"534ab016c3a3682e0700195a","id":63813,"name":"Rothaford Gray","order":6,"profile_path":"/rKC1RIKc3FOYhcfgpO6rPCqdby7.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"534aad90c3a3682e07001929","department":"Writing","id":1228498,"job":"Writer","name":"Stephen Kronish","profile_path":"/eWOOKII4B0QCC9BrsmU5xfssWo4.jpg"},{"credit_id":"534aaddec3a3682ded0018e1","department":"Writing","id":1211991,"job":"Writer","name":"Joel Surnow","profile_path":"/3lMg3yoIr8C5AEb2SMooT25seod.jpg"},{"credit_id":"534aae10c3a3682dfe001882","department":"Directing","id":25873,"job":"Director","name":"Jon Cassar","profile_path":"/oTRxoPrHd08tC5gDrWBolMeomM.jpg"},{"credit_id":"564d09299251414dcb0082a8","department":"Art","id":1314894,"job":"Production Design","name":"Rocco Matteo","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"534aaec1c3a3682dfe00188d","department":"Production","id":25873,"job":"Executive Producer","name":"Jon Cassar","profile_path":"/oTRxoPrHd08tC5gDrWBolMeomM.jpg"},{"credit_id":"534aaeddc3a3682dfe001891","department":"Production","id":7800,"job":"Casting","name":"Deirdre Bowen","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"534aaef5c3a3682dd1001871","department":"Production","id":1176357,"job":"Casting","name":"Barbara J.
