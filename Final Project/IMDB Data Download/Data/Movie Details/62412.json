Hannah fulfills her promise to God, and gives up her son to His service. In return, God blesses Hannah by making her son, Samuel, the chosen Prophet of the people of Israel. At the tabernacle of Ark of the Covenant, Hannah prays for a son. She promises God that she will offer the boy up to His service. Eli, the high priest, overhears her prayer and sends her off with vague promises. Eli's sons abuse their position and steal from those who come to offer sacrifice.","popularity":0.00285,"poster_path":"/y5RewQDpQGKXR9fjzvdvApqPydj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"Samuel the Boy Prophet","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":2,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Animated Stories from the Bible - Samuel"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
