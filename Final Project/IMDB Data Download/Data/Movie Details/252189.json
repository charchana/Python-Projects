However, the decade ended and so did director Julian Barrett’s career. Now Barrett plans to resurrect his gory series via a modern reboot patterned after reality filmmaking. With his former leading lady and an eclectic group of 10 young “contestants,” Barrett returns to the same locale where his old splatter-fests were filmed. When one of the campers is found savagely murdered, they realize there’s more at stake than just fame and fortune. Each of them is in a fight for their lives as they realize summer is over – forever.","popularity":0.052065,"poster_path":"/xRsME5Kmv5opWqDOdgmpT54NJbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Class of 85 LLC","id":26013}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pitch your tent, dig your grave.","title":"Camp Dread","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":5,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Julian Barrett","credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c91129949","id":21315,"name":"Eric Roberts","order":0,"profile_path":"/45i6fsxBwH1UyA74tWQ6am0DntC.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Sheriff Donlyn","credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c9112994d","id":21320,"name":"Danielle Harris","order":1,"profile_path":"/q3wQP4ZwVjfBerFK0iVZPzaF5BL.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Rachel Steele","credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c91129951","id":74673,"name":"Felissa Rose","order":2,"profile_path":"/PEiMOmcnhRJGlrOXxD2bSrRc37.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"John Hill","credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c91129961","id":92803,"name":"Brian Gallagher","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c91129965","id":1283950,"name":"Ashley Sumner","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Adrienne","credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c91129969","id":1147876,"name":"Nicole Cinaglia","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Novak","credit_id":"53abd9ecc3a3684bcb0013d7","id":570758,"name":"Joe Raffa","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Katie","credit_id":"53abda10c3a3684bc20013ee","id":1334375,"name":"Montana Marks","order":7,"profile_path":"/qAcwaivD8LH13vQrhZ5MGh6LlnM.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Missy","credit_id":"53abda39c3a3684bc20013f5","id":1334376,"name":"Gnomi Gre","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Jerry","credit_id":"53abda60c3a3684bbf00142a","id":1283949,"name":"Kyle Patrick Brennan","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Vinny","credit_id":"53abda87c3a3684bb9001433","id":1334378,"name":"Davy Raphaely","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Ming","credit_id":"53abdac2c3a3684bb900143a","id":1334381,"name":"Angel Sanchez","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Matty","credit_id":"53abdae6c3a3684bc2001401","id":1334383,"name":"Alexander Mandell","order":12,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c91129957","department":"Directing","id":936236,"job":"Director","name":"Harrison Smith","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4e329251416c9112995d","department":"Writing","id":936236,"job":"Writer","name":"Harrison Smith","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53abdbbd0e0a26761c0017bd","department":"Production","id":936236,"job":"Producer","name":"Harrison Smith","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53abdbef0e0a267616001820","department":"Production","id":92803,"job":"Producer","name":"Brian Gallagher","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53abdc340e0a26761c0017db","department":"Sound","id":1150805,"job":"Music","name":"John Avarese","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53abdc5d0e0a2676190016d8","department":"Crew","id":1334384,"job":"Cinematography","name":"Charlie Anderson","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53abdc7f0e0a26762500196a","department":"Editing","id":570758,"job":"Editor","name":"Joe Raffa","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53abdcc90e0a26760f001811","department":"Costume & Make-Up","id":1334385,"job":"Makeup Artist","name":"Constance Hall","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"548d8fcc92514122ff003d51","department":"Crew","id":91315,"job":"Special Effects","name":"Cleve Hall","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a7d6c3c3a3680c2500173d","department":"Camera","id":1408211,"job":"Steadicam Operator","name":"Martin Whittier","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a7d73dc3a3680c3300153f","department":"Lighting","id":1408212,"job":"Gaffer","name":"Kevin Martin","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a7d757c3a3680c21001936","department":"Lighting","id":1408213,"job":"Best Boy Electric","name":"Christopher T.
