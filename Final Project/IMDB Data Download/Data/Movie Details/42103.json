Sheik is an Italian whose primary interests are his car, Frank Sinatra, and Jill. At first she is taken aback by his forwardness, but they soon develop a relationship, much to the chagrin of their parents. Sheik gets expelled from school, and Jill is accepted at an all-girls college. After a fight, Sheik goes to Florida to work in a club lip-synching Sinatra songs. Sheik becomes dissatisfied with his Florida lifestyle and goes back to New Jersey to try to win Jill over.","popularity":0.176416,"poster_path":"/8rgKtclCcsHP8fEryQ37yVPksIF.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Double Play","id":2957}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-04-03","revenue":1867792,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby It's You","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Jill Rosen","credit_id":"52fe45edc3a36847f80e2975","id":2165,"name":"Rosanna Arquette","order":0,"profile_path":"/rQMQYQUF9QzD6oDfkP6tsjmyZhS.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Albert 'Sheik' Capadilupo","credit_id":"530fbda7925141102a000103","id":147119,"name":"Vincent Spano","order":1,"profile_path":"/puKutdiHTWPVw4SnOPxVRPY1LxS.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Rosen","credit_id":"52fe45edc3a36847f80e297d","id":11903,"name":"Joanna Merlin","order":2,"profile_path":"/dOpsuxqXwfix8rVWjfSgHkgK09l.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Dr. Rosen","credit_id":"54a874c9c3a3680c290028a8","id":169073,"name":"Jack Davidson","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Capadilupo","credit_id":"54a874df9251414d63002798","id":1408518,"name":"Nick Ferrari","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Mrs. Capadilupo","credit_id":"54a874fbc3a3680c290028ac","id":1408519,"name":"Dolores Messina","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Miss Vernon, Teacher","credit_id":"54a875139251414d700024d3","id":76980,"name":"Leora Dana","order":6,"profile_path":"/7whZ7yYgBuBiuqX78mhuSEXlOyn.jpg"},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Mr. Ripeppi, Teacher","credit_id":"54a8756dc3a3680c250026f9","id":7576,"name":"Bill Raymond","order":7,"profile_path":"/9qUefRsvEzitR2j8CwtXYbddayE.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Mr. McManus, Teacher","credit_id":"54a874149251414d5d002810","id":5176,"name":"Sam McMurray","order":8,"profile_path":"/5NgEWVYgGWCj4N6bzEzU5a7c0wN.jpg"},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Jody, High School Girl","credit_id":"54a875d39251414d6700267a","id":157054,"name":"Liane Curtis","order":9,"profile_path":"/zOdmZINjH8J7Cfn3C9dy12nuw4.jpg"},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Beth, High School Girl","credit_id":"54a876899251414d70002500","id":1408529,"name":"Claudia Sherman","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":19,"character":"Debra","credit_id":"54a8769dc3a3680c21002ae0","id":92758,"name":"Marta Kober","order":11,"profile_path":"/dAfrOybyr9C6XeZeuTIrW1iU7O5.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Leslie, College Girl","credit_id":"54a8742fc3a3680c1c0027a2","id":177443,"name":"Tracy Pollan","order":12,"profile_path":"/1NcY5LhUF6dGyoFBghIQ9HTMa3Z.jpg"},{"cast_id":21,"character":"Shelly, College Girl","credit_id":"54a876ed9251414d6000281a","id":933388,"name":"Rachel Dretzin","order":14,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":22,"character":"Chris, College Girl","credit_id":"54a8770ac3a3680c3000298d","id":1408531,"name":"Susan Derendorf","order":15,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":23,"character":"Vinnie","credit_id":"54a87722c3a3680c290028eb","id":7164,"name":"Frank Vincent","order":16,"profile_path":"/j8BhmYAt9ZPKfiRvT0RbC0zwCOI.jpg"},{"cast_id":24,"character":"Joann","credit_id":"54a87743c3a3680c1e00274b","id":214666,"name":"Robin Johnson","order":17,"profile_path":"/vhNZ4rmc6HtVFdH8cMD84cVD75N.jpg"},{"cast_id":25,"character":"Rat","credit_id":"54a877649251414d670026a2","id":102323,"name":"Gary McCleery","order":18,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"53a0edb2c3a3687bab000ffa","id":8654,"name":"Matthew Modine","order":19,"profile_path":"/tEQG1Us5IuoKYtufZe6waWtxfeg.jpg"},{"cast_id":26,"character":"Plasky","credit_id":"54a877b1c3a3680c25002731","id":1408534,"name":"John Ferraro","order":20,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":27,"character":"Miss Katz","credit_id":"54a877c69251414d630027e2","id":1408535,"name":"Merel Poloway","order":21,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":28,"character":"Barry","credit_id":"54a877e1c3a3680c25002739","id":1378739,"name":"Donnie Kehr","order":22,"profile_path":"/uXQiRUw95y9YNxCKpgpYSbKGaHn.jpg"},{"cast_id":29,"character":"Phillip","credit_id":"54a87818c3a3680c300029b6","id":100591,"name":"Michael E.
