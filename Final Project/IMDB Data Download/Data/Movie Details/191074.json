However, it was NOT the branch from which Sitting Bull originated and the leader was a guy named Inkpaduta. But \"Inkpaduta at the Spirit Lake Massacre\" doesn't have such a nice ring to it, so the folks changed this and many other details. Four women, not two, were kidnapped--and two of them were then killed.","popularity":0.00157,"poster_path":"/4DuyrIWUyN7hAksLZpywmjXwzkq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"Donald Keefe","credit_id":"54aafad2c3a368241e001b54","id":52175,"name":"Bryant Washburn","order":1,"profile_path":"/z3BzX6i3pwBWevZvTWVbSadNrUA.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Sitting Bull","credit_id":"54aafb0ec3a3684091001243","id":30298,"name":"Chief Yowlachie","order":2,"profile_path":"/gwRTFEFHMd7TRo1NlITzJo1JIyz.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Mame Mulcain","credit_id":"54aafb3292514156460022d3","id":1173026,"name":"Anne Schaefer","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Pat Mulcain","credit_id":"54aafb74c3a36822b7002436","id":1363816,"name":"Jay Morley","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Ceila Moore","credit_id":"54aafbe0c3a368235200232b","id":1150494,"name":"Shirley Palmer","order":5,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4c779251416c910f5d51","department":"Directing","id":88648,"job":"Director","name":"Robert N.
