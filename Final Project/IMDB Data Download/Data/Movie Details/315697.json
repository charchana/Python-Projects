It’s from Rainbow Dash, everyone runs over to find out what she has to say. Rainbow Dash is at Rainbow Castle in Unicornia. She says how much she misses them all and wishes that they were there. She says “Rarity gave her a tour of the Crystal Castle” then it cuts to Rarity showing Rainbow Dash around. Rarity shows off their “Hello Hello” arch which echoes everything they say. They then find a rainbow door and it’s filled with big bouncy balls. They go bouncing on them around the room and out the window. After a song Rainbow Dash gets Rarity to post the postcard for her. We see it reach the ponies by rainbow and as Puzzlemint reads out “Wish you were here”, Rainbow Dash and the unicorns appear in their carriage to join the other ponies.","popularity":0.001802,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"name":"Hasbro","id":2598},{"name":"SD Entertainment","id":29070}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Little Pony: Greetings from Unicornia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Zipzee (voice)","credit_id":"563df4d79251413b1300c3ca","id":74368,"name":"Andrea Libman","order":1,"profile_path":"/8tPjtsYr8NQpdX64hctM6UOOlJQ.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Tra La La (voice)","credit_id":"563df4e39251413b1300c3cc","id":74365,"name":"Britt McKillip","order":2,"profile_path":"/yjLjEJY4JbIaARfZj2hX48SCrje.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"563e8995c3a3681b5402e30f","department":"Directing","id":1225630,"job":"Director","name":"John Grusd","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"563df4c2c3a3681b5402c9ac","department":"Writing","id":1532122,"job":"Writer","name":"Jeanne Romano","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"ro","iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Română","english_name":"Romanian"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
