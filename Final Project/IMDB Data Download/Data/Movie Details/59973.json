Network television executive Gavin (Nestor Carbonell) hopes to reunite celebrated Hollywood stars Piper Grayson (Reynolds), Kate Westbourne (MacLaine), and Addie Holden (Collins) in a TV special after their 1960s movie musical \"Boy Crazy\" is re-released in the 1990s. Though the three women share the same agent, Beryl Mason (Taylor), Gavin's seemingly insurmountable obstacle is that they all cannot stand each other.","popularity":0.039345,"poster_path":"/fdxDrCdQhu9xB6IO4Cx18GHmnVn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They swore they'd never work together again - their shocking reunion - still throwing tantrums, still stealing headlines, still making producers cry!","title":"These Old Broads","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Beryl Mason","credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a5411","id":3635,"name":"Elizabeth Taylor","order":0,"profile_path":"/rPbfZlBX18OIj7H1Bahq7YcJL0v.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Piper Grayson","credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a5415","id":8857,"name":"Debbie Reynolds","order":1,"profile_path":"/p5o3qOl4bFZxrnUxG826cIN0GvP.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Kate Westbourne","credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a5419","id":4090,"name":"Shirley MacLaine","order":2,"profile_path":"/hVfKkJacFeS7qgmkFA9fWT5CmfQ.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Addie Holden","credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a541d","id":13637,"name":"Joan Collins","order":3,"profile_path":"/8KKTDl6jaM6RTWuRpuuXOvMsvG.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Wesley Westbourne","credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a5421","id":55265,"name":"Jonathan Silverman","order":4,"profile_path":"/b5tsxmpYUfppjdsPc3V7iiu4YyM.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a5437","id":9111,"name":"Peter Graves","order":5,"profile_path":"/sR9B0mE399EGI9aRxMbWMpk2GKT.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Mr Stern","credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a543b","id":56442,"name":"Gene Barry","order":6,"profile_path":"/q2DQGsyA5hxyKDEiLeR3yVGmcqM.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Gavin","credit_id":"54a591b19251411d5300f619","id":21316,"name":"Nestor Carbonell","order":7,"profile_path":"/yALf2koeUAc2UNoT5o0hQO6Akzn.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Hooker","credit_id":"54a591c5c3a3682f1b014e47","id":4,"name":"Carrie Fisher","order":8,"profile_path":"/pbleNurCYdrLFQMEnlQB2nkOR1O.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a5427","department":"Directing","id":116370,"job":"Director","name":"Matthew Diamond","profile_path":"/5jQm4Tm1xIATDcxWBPQ5YYPoAyD.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a542d","department":"Writing","id":4,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Carrie Fisher","profile_path":"/pbleNurCYdrLFQMEnlQB2nkOR1O.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe49a5c3a36847f81a5433","department":"Writing","id":56107,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Elaine Pope","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"hu","iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Magyar","english_name":"Hungarian"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5609,"name":"nostalgia"},{"id":9824,"name":"reunion"}]}}
