They prefer to use lying, cheating, stealing, or brute force. Take, for instance, the pharmacy student who uses his skils to make date-rape drugs, and he sells these concoctions in order to pay tuition. While each \"dirtbag\" has his own plotline, all become obstacles to the main character - a dirtbag who is at the crossroads of change. Will he find redemption or destruction?","popularity":0.000286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirtbags","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
