The story of his family begins with his great-great-grandfather, who burned down the manors of German landowners during the 1905 revolution. My Family Tree takes us on a journey to various countries and political regimes, showing Jānis’s ancestors to be people with diverse fates and life stories. A rich Latvian trader, a red rifleman loyal to Lenin, a carpenter at the KGB and war refugees in Sweden are only a few branches on his family tree, and the boy has heard something unusal and unforgettable about each and every one of these people.","popularity":0.001795,"poster_path":"/cRus8fvKXMnibFhAtIzDQ6Kk7r7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Family Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434d7","id":1105424,"name":"Harijs Spanovskis","order":0,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434db","id":1105425,"name":"Andris Bērziņš","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434df","id":1207116,"name":"Inita Dzelme","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434e3","id":1207117,"name":"Artūrs Dīcis","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434e7","id":1207118,"name":"Edgars Petkevičs","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434eb","id":1207119,"name":"Juris Circenis","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434ef","id":1207120,"name":"Guna Zariņa","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434f3","id":1207121,"name":"Kristaps Rasims","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434f7","id":1207122,"name":"Aldis Siliņš","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434fb","id":1207123,"name":"Ilze Akmentiņa","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c751434ff","id":1207124,"name":"Jevgenijs Isajevs","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c75143503","id":1207125,"name":"Marija Bērziņa","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddb9251416c75143507","id":1207126,"name":"Gints Grāvelis","order":12,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54aa38b49251415646000f15","department":"Directing","id":1105422,"job":"Director","name":"Una Celma","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aa38c2c3a368241e000bd8","department":"Camera","id":1105430,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Uldis Jancis","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aa38cd9251417e060034da","department":"Editing","id":1105427,"job":"Editor","name":"Oļegs Aleksejevs","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aa393b9251414d670060b8","department":"Writing","id":1105426,"job":"Writer","name":"Matīss Kaža","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aa38eb9251415757000e3d","department":"Writing","id":1105422,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Una Celma","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]}}
