From the steamy jungles of Malaya to the dusty and desolate outback of Australia Based on Nevil Shute' international bestselling novel A TOWN LIKE ALICE follows the lives of Jean Paget and Joe Harman. Meeting in Malaya--she an attractive young English captive and he a cheerful Australian POW tortured for a simple act of kindness. Separated first by their captors then by the distance of passing years, the two are finally reunited in the rugged outback of Australia-to face a challenge every bit as demanding as their wartime trials.","popularity":3e-06,"poster_path":"/ivx19k700VeczFVFSm4EtdGxtUq.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Victorian Film","id":22046}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1981-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":301,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Their love proved to be as demanding as the land","title":"A Town Like Alice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":5,"character":"Jean Paget","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8a9","id":67835,"name":"Helen Morse","order":0,"profile_path":"/kS9ZDqT9kzSSH8GdRxJgX0BuiKk.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Joe Harman","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8ad","id":29092,"name":"Bryan Brown","order":1,"profile_path":"/ppE8Gy8jyjB5oQwwryVFgvQlHUr.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Noel Strachan","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8b1","id":41998,"name":"Gordon Jackson","order":2,"profile_path":"/yz1S8Ge93l9DoC3zmElq26KN2Ug.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Frith","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8b5","id":132600,"name":"Dorothy Alison","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Sergeant Mifune","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8b9","id":87520,"name":"Yuki Shimoda","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Sally Wilson-Hayes","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8bd","id":212531,"name":"Anna Volska","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Derek Wilson-Hayes","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8c1","id":217114,"name":"Donald MacDonald","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Collard","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8c5","id":222623,"name":"Pat Evison","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Captain Sugamo","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8c9","id":47505,"name":"Richard Narita","order":8,"profile_path":"/bECZTo1Zr47ZFudNuKxJKTB27Ql.jpg"},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Annie","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8cd","id":94785,"name":"Arkie Whiteley","order":9,"profile_path":"/9XFHw9sybmU6mfrwLwiyIxQwjiP.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8d1","id":222624,"name":"Lorna Lesley","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Jane","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8d5","id":80951,"name":"Lucy Bell","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Freddie","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8d9","id":222626,"name":"Sean Hinton","order":12,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Audrey","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8dd","id":222627,"name":"Debbie Baile","order":13,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":19,"character":"Eileen","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8e1","id":61906,"name":"Cecily Polson","order":14,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":20,"character":"Lester 'Les'","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8e5","id":75900,"name":"John Lee","order":15,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":21,"character":"Donald Paget","credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8e9","id":102603,"name":"John Howard","order":16,"profile_path":"/id5ucdglU6oPIibTzrLrtWBxTbw.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b893","department":"Directing","id":75429,"job":"Director","name":"David Stevens","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b899","department":"Writing","id":187333,"job":"Writer","name":"Tom Hegarty","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b89f","department":"Writing","id":114640,"job":"Writer","name":"Nevil Shute","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48d4c3a36847f817b8a5","department":"Writing","id":158858,"job":"Writer","name":"Rosemary Anne Sisson","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":10787,"name":"jungle"}]}}
