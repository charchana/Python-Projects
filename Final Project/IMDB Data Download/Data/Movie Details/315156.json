The person who suffers the most from the situation is their son Marco, who normally lives with his father in a beautiful, but lonely country house. Marco's only satisfaction comes from riding his horse Socrates around the countryside, but Massimo sends the horse to his father-in-law in Sicily when, tired of solitude, he decides to sell everything and move into town. At this point, Marco, who has by chance witnessed the kidnapping and release of Gilberto, decides to flee and pretend he has been kidnapped to gain his parents' attention. His journey to Sicily, where his maternal grandfather lives near Ragusa, is crammed full of adventures, but the child makes it in the end, thanks to Rocco, a Neapolitan street urchin, who befriends him.","popularity":0.000273,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"name":"T.R.A.C.","id":7631}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1978-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Angels","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"Elisabetta","credit_id":"54a5ab37c3a3682f1e014d30","id":43814,"name":"Nathalie Delon","order":1,"profile_path":"/8rQzGV7ITkHYdG10RgGKXZsvf3n.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Massimo","credit_id":"54a5ab49c3a3684d8f00802f","id":25333,"name":"Philippe Leroy","order":2,"profile_path":"/1LUvDUsO6mxUBVXSjuGbyKESzDI.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Marco","credit_id":"54a5ab5ac3a3682f1b015102","id":1407511,"name":"Alessandro Doria","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Rocco","credit_id":"54a5ab7b9251411f900023e5","id":1407512,"name":"Flavio Colombaioni","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Il nonno","credit_id":"54a5ab8cc3a3685542012995","id":11128,"name":"Arthur Kennedy","order":5,"profile_path":"/k8ew7ZMRadQeDyteqt7ZicSySub.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a5abaa9251414d2700f4cd","department":"Directing","id":935976,"job":"Director","name":"Enzo Doria","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5abb7c3a3686428005ebf","department":"Writing","id":935976,"job":"Writer","name":"Enzo Doria","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5abc7c3a3686428005ec3","department":"Writing","id":1204967,"job":"Writer","name":"Manrico Melchiorre","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5abd9c3a3682f210151f1","department":"Writing","id":1110564,"job":"Writer","name":"Maria Teresa Rienzi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5abeec3a3684d8f00803f","department":"Production","id":935976,"job":"Producer","name":"Enzo Doria","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5ac02c3a3686428005ecd","department":"Sound","id":29501,"job":"Music","name":"Stelvio Cipriani","profile_path":"/lMk2Iwbq2RcvCZd9UJw0QtT74VZ.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a5ac17c3a3682f1b015119","department":"Camera","id":240902,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Mario Masini","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5ac26c3a3682f1e014d4c","department":"Editing","id":592058,"job":"Editor","name":"Angelo Curi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5ac3cc3a3684d8f008044","department":"Art","id":1128172,"job":"Production Design","name":"Gisella Longo","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5ac4bc3a368764f011f67","department":"Art","id":1407513,"job":"Production Design","name":"Ivana Manni","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5ac599251411d5300f8c6","department":"Costume & Make-Up","id":1128172,"job":"Costume Design","name":"Gisella Longo","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a5ac6bc3a36855420129a7","department":"Costume & Make-Up","id":1407513,"job":"Costume Design","name":"Ivana Manni","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":184439,"name":"divorced parents"}]}}
