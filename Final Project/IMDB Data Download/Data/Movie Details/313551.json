From each corner of the earth, five climbers – Sam Elias, James Pearson, Caroline Ciavaldini, Jacopo Larcher and Yuji Hirayama – attempt to open a new multi-pitch route on the basalt island of Reunion. Lost in the South Indian Ocean, Reunion is the childhood home of Caroline and, after traveling the world for several years as a professional climber, returning was something she had to do. By working together as climbers and friends, the team is able to open, ground-up, one of the hardest multi-pitch rock climbs in the world.","popularity":0.023801,"poster_path":"/um8MGWf1AteiaMucvuTM2GZASWl.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Ananda Media","id":42895}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zembrocal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"549a81dd925141312f00142d","id":1403111,"name":"Caroline Ciavaldini","order":1,"profile_path":"/3vYXdv2tegTKSuFj0DaBNJgJa7t.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"549a81e4925141312f001431","id":1025200,"name":"James Pearson","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"549a81eec3a3680b27000b22","id":1403133,"name":"Yuji Hirayama","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"549a81f5c3a3682f19001308","id":1403166,"name":"Sam Elias","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"549a81fec3a3682f280012d2","id":1403313,"name":"Jacopo Larcher","order":5,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"549a81ae9251415dc1000be6","department":"Directing","id":1403311,"job":"Director","name":"Pietro Porro","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"549a81c4c3a3682f21001387","department":"Production","id":1403312,"job":"Producer","name":"Richard Felderer","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"549a81d292514131230012b9","department":"Production","id":1403111,"job":"Producer","name":"Caroline Ciavaldini","profile_path":"/3vYXdv2tegTKSuFj0DaBNJgJa7t.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":201008,"name":"rock climbing"},{"id":209454,"name":"la reunion"}]}}
