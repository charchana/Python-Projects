She moves into Ana’s downtown apartment. Soon, the two women develop a strong bond. But in a full-moon night, Clara hears Ana’s scream: the baby is coming early. Ana dies before Clara’s eyes as her son rips through her body. It is a werewolf baby. For love, Clara doesn’t abandon her job: she escapes with the child to her poor neighborhood and raises him as her own son. With time, she learns to see beyond his inhuman features. But she has to keep the boy hidden – there is a chance they are being chased. The father of the child wants it back.","popularity":0.000365,"poster_path":"/8tETxLGqB1q2l2v2M2AUpSVKSj6.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Dezenove Som e Imagens Produções","id":10023}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Good Manners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a62af09251411d530108b9","department":"Writing","id":1050897,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Juliana Rojas","profile_path":"/wUuDCNHWqsPr80Qw13lCs7N807n.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a62ae09251411d530108b7","department":"Writing","id":1050896,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Marco Dutra","profile_path":"/tKpZsiC1x7Riu7cb8Al0tYaSLEt.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a627d79251411a5200010b","department":"Directing","id":1050896,"job":"Director","name":"Marco Dutra","profile_path":"/tKpZsiC1x7Riu7cb8Al0tYaSLEt.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a627b092514117dd008c92","department":"Directing","id":1050897,"job":"Director","name":"Juliana Rojas","profile_path":"/wUuDCNHWqsPr80Qw13lCs7N807n.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"pt","iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Português","english_name":"Portuguese"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]}}
