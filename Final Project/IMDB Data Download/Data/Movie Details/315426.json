Three young men - Min Yasui, an attorney from Oregon, Gordon Hirabayashi, a Quaker college student in Washington, and Fred Korematsu, a Bay Area welder - serve jail sentences for violating laws against Japanese Americans; the U.S. Supreme Court upholds their convictions. Forty years later, the three file suits to have their sentences overturned. This documentary tells their stories and helps break 40 years of silence and shame. By the end of the documentary, the court proceedings remain unfinished.","popularity":1.2e-05,"poster_path":"/yoCyObtpwltAIT2CmnTOCS3ZIpR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unfinished Business","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"54a7bac3c3a3680c1e001540","id":59401,"name":"Amy Hill","order":1,"profile_path":"/aJ6hQSvpt4zVZVnJmElIAEkaDfc.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54a7bacbc3a3680c29001556","id":1408139,"name":"Gordon Hirabayashi","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54a7bad3c3a3680c2900155b","id":1408141,"name":"Fred Korematsu","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"54a7badc9251414d630014bc","id":1408142,"name":"Min Yasui","order":4,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a7baf39251414d5d00149d","department":"Directing","id":110962,"job":"Director","name":"Steven Okazaki","profile_path":"/wEk6MMrY3JDsDdLWbbLe5QOS4BJ.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a7bafbc3a3680c330012d5","department":"Writing","id":1408143,"job":"Writer","name":"Laura Ide","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a7bb079251414d6d001322","department":"Writing","id":1408144,"job":"Writer","name":"Jane Kaihatsu","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a7bb0fc3a3680c2100165e","department":"Writing","id":110962,"job":"Writer","name":"Steven Okazaki","profile_path":"/wEk6MMrY3JDsDdLWbbLe5QOS4BJ.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a7bb17c3a3680c21001663","department":"Writing","id":1408145,"job":"Writer","name":"Kei Yokomizo","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a7bb259251414d6a0013d9","department":"Production","id":1408144,"job":"Associate Producer","name":"Jane Kaihatsu","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a7bb309251414d60001525","department":"Production","id":110962,"job":"Producer","name":"Steven Okazaki","profile_path":"/wEk6MMrY3JDsDdLWbbLe5QOS4BJ.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a7bb38c3a3680c29001563","department":"Crew","id":110962,"job":"Cinematography","name":"Steven Okazaki","profile_path":"/wEk6MMrY3JDsDdLWbbLe5QOS4BJ.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a7bb419251414d6a0013dc","department":"Editing","id":110962,"job":"Editor","name":"Steven Okazaki","profile_path":"/wEk6MMrY3JDsDdLWbbLe5QOS4BJ.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Unfinished Business: The Japanese-American Internment Cases"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
