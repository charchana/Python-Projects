From love to crime, from marriage to work, from beauty to the ultimate death. Instead of a traditional film adaptation Tarn has been guided by actress Thandie Newton's reading of the text - and then traveled around the world with his 16mm and HD camera and filmed people, situations and places that resonate with, rather than illustrate, the text's themes.","popularity":0.000902,"poster_path":"/k9cdj9XafoEyPF0TdEk8Z4bMZSN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prophet","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4badc3a368484e194647","department":"Directing","id":980189,"job":"Director","name":"Gary Tarn","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
