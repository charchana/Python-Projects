While the Russians invaded Ostpreussen hundred of thousands of civilians were evacuated by ships. Gotenhafen was the last open port and ships left the town almost by the minute, overloaded by refugees. One of the last ships to leave Gotenhafen was the 'Wilhelm Gustloff', a former 'Kraft durch Freude' pleasure cruiser designed for 1000 passengers. Until today it is unknown how many people were on board but it is said to be around 10.000. The ship sunk without a trace and only a handful of people survived this hellish nightmare.","popularity":0.006389,"poster_path":"/vEmpQgXL3cl4HTxHBSspx0EnY8P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkness Fell On Gotenhafen","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":4,"character":"Maria Reiser","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114aa9","id":117787,"name":"Sonja Ziemann","order":0,"profile_path":"/A6b6VHaLuR8hteKTYYOVJTzDbuD.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Kurt Reiser","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114aad","id":26419,"name":"Gunnar Möller","order":1,"profile_path":"/aT02ieaosoYTHGFao6vWeUBuDnH.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Hans Schott","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ac9","id":3756,"name":"Erik Schumann","order":2,"profile_path":"/yL4RmREnxzZIYKujj5g5E3zFoVb.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Generalin von Reuss","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ab1","id":58235,"name":"Brigitte Horney","order":3,"profile_path":"/3AN6YAQd509CSDHylMXMRB9gMGD.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Edith Marquardt","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ab5","id":18540,"name":"Mady Rahl","order":4,"profile_path":"/2tFdTQxVyQoZZ5t5SxpkZeETQhl.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Dr. Beck","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ab9","id":14121,"name":"Wolfgang Preiss","order":5,"profile_path":"/vZotpPKrfDhjeU2CwxPlNnRCXCY.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Vater Marquardt","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114abd","id":14127,"name":"Erich Dunskus","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Vater Reiser","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ac1","id":133936,"name":"Willy Maertens","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Dienstmädchen Marta","credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ac5","id":110955,"name":"Tatjana Bokan","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Gaston","credit_id":"54aa98259251414d67006a09","id":37793,"name":"Dietmar Schönherr","order":9,"profile_path":"/8RVVcLmVhRDU61Sf6cr5jWRW9Lh.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Oberleutnant Dankel","credit_id":"54aa9838c3a3682352001921","id":18507,"name":"Günter Pfitzmann","order":10,"profile_path":"/vvFeJyxpLtMexSChZZdmxEfrQC6.jpg"},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Arzt","credit_id":"54aa984892514157570017b8","id":26837,"name":"Günther Ungeheuer","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Funker der Gustloff","credit_id":"54aa987692514155f20018b6","id":1305180,"name":"Karl-Heinz Kreienbaum","order":12,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Kapitän Zahn","credit_id":"54aa98889251417e06003cd3","id":38124,"name":"Carl Lange","order":13,"profile_path":"/bK8C0Bl1Q4oBBW40Nnxq6N5cJhj.jpg"},{"cast_id":19,"character":"Monika","credit_id":"54aa989892514156460018ad","id":26526,"name":"Carla Hagen","order":14,"profile_path":"/s3ty1bD12kWD8kN1mjxANUWLDuq.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114a99","department":"Directing","id":103907,"job":"Director","name":"Frank Wisbar","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe46d5c3a36847f8114aa5","department":"Writing","id":103907,"job":"Writer","name":"Frank Wisbar","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
