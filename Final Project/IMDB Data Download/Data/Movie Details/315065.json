Founded by four autodidacts they defied any classification by producing electronic music combined with Dadaist texts and wearing absurd costumes.  The documentary AG Geige - ein Amateurfilm tells the story of this formation that even made it to release an official record short before the fall of the Berlin Wall. By means of interviews with the protagonists and their supporters, supplemented by video footage of live performances and self-produced clips, the film is focusing on the self-understanding of the four members, their artistic visions, the creative and working process. and, of course, the film also tells the story of the last few years of the GDR system, whose agony made this project possible at all.
