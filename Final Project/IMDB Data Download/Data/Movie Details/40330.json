Everything in his life is well-ordered -- stock investments, luxury car, the latest computer, stylish and tasteful clothes...well-ordered to the point of being utterly predictable.  Jackie Pigeon, the owner of the Camping Pigeon campground, is a go-getter who always gets her way. She conducts her business with a sure hand and everything at the campground runs smoothly. Her life is the complete opposite of Pierre-Louis's -- she's rather messy, of modest means, wears flamboyant and sexy clothes...everything in her life hovers on the edge of bad taste.  Two people from completely different worlds whose paths would not normally have been fated to cross.","popularity":0.047588,"poster_path":"/hZrUN9tzdG3YZ5CuIDViWtGWRJV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Camper","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":4,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":5,"character":"Pierre-Louis / Marcel","credit_id":"52fe458bc3a36847f80cd561","id":123919,"name":"Guy A.
