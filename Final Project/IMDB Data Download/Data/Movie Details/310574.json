This is what Ha-young (Lee Yo-won) has to do for her best friend, Mi-ryung (Kim Min-hee). Mi-ryung has been planning for a surprise party for her overseas boyfriend Jun-woo (Shin Ha-gyun), but her plans are stopped short when her father finds out that Jun-woo is half-Hawaiian, and forbids the party from being held. Mi-ryung is put under even greater pressure when Jun-Woo tells her that he would arrive early, and she pleads with Ha-Young to intercept Jun-Woo at the airport, and to keep him from turning up at Mi-ryung's place before she can iron things out.","popularity":0.003377,"poster_path":"/yVHIZa4fFOXBD7o2mkVEAs4746x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surprise Party","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"Kim Jun Woo","credit_id":"548b0490925141260800193f","id":25004,"name":"Shin Ha-kyun","order":1,"profile_path":"/n5MjmCVb91w8OgwFqwrTQMJwRGv.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Ha Young","credit_id":"548b04aac3a36807120019c6","id":1248422,"name":"Lee Yo-won","order":2,"profile_path":"/xIs0VZreG9qlCPTMFsXNuF3z1jg.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Kim Jun Woo","credit_id":"548b04e4c3a36807240016b5","id":115290,"name":"Lee Sun-Kyun","order":4,"profile_path":"/JmYP4j8PR2ZrycF5SlOHXi6Ctj.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Hwang Mi Ryeong","credit_id":"55604f75c3a36868e5005628","id":123664,"name":"Kim Min-Hee","order":5,"profile_path":"/uGANIG91lPNOSZ14CRfTugzKwCe.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"58817671925141302b005f0e","department":"Directing","id":1555604,"job":"Director","name":"Kim Jin-sung","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
