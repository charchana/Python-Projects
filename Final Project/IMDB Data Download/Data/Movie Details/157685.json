But soon filmmakers also began focusing their attention on hands. Using film extracts, Farocki explores this visual language, its symbolism, Freudian slips, automatisms and its music. Often, hands betray an emotion which the face tries to dissimulate. They can also function as a conduit (exchanging money) or witness to a form of competence (work).","popularity":0.000173,"poster_path":"/1UnHnCNpf6CcUcSiaRpN6V4gEZk.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Harun Farocki Filmproduktion","id":43265}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Expression of Hands","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4bcd9251416c910e61d1","department":"Directing","id":2333,"job":"Director","name":"Harun Farocki","profile_path":"/inkcJLHpfd5iZjW0cin5IqJNmlK.jpg"},{"credit_id":"55b71de3c3a368228200176e","department":"Writing","id":2333,"job":"Writer","name":"Harun Farocki","profile_path":"/inkcJLHpfd5iZjW0cin5IqJNmlK.jpg"},{"credit_id":"55b71df192514120ec00188a","department":"Writing","id":1491151,"job":"Writer","name":"Jörg Becker","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
