Jesus teaches that forgiveness comes from God as He instructs Peter to catch a fish that contains a coin to pay Peter's debt. Jesus also teaches about a man who is forgiven by his king of an enormous debt. Yet, the forgiven man leaves and immediately casts a man, who owes him almost nothing, into prison. The king then rescinds his forgiveness. To receive forgiveness we must also forgive.","popularity":0.001299,"poster_path":"/eFJOvDzqAWflffpa8QY6brMDQVu.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"NEST Family Entertainment","id":4107}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgive Us Our Debts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe47ffc3a368484e0e4991","department":"Directing","id":107274,"job":"Director","name":"Richard Rich","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Animated Stories from the New Testament: Forgive Us Our Debts"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Animated Stories from the New Testament 14 - Forgive Us Our Debts"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
