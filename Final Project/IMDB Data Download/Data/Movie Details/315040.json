The jingoistic story concerns a series of clashes between French occupational forces and a rebellious Chleuh chieftain. Itto (Simone Berriau), chief's daughter, becomes embroiled in a romance with a Moroccan tribesman who has gone over to the French side. It is implied in Itto that it's okay to betray one's own people if it will preserve French colonialism in Africa. To modern viewers, the rampant chauvinism in Itto is a difficult pill to swallow.","popularity":0.000162,"poster_path":"/cLL9Lb741R2b7gA4HbxA4b9YL0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Itto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a4f2bf92514117dd0065fd","department":"Directing","id":1118722,"job":"Director","name":"Marie Epstein","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a4f2d2c3a3686428004a73","department":"Directing","id":1146132,"job":"Director","name":"Jean Benoît-Lévy","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
