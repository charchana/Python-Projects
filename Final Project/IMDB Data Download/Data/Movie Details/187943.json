Letian (Berlin Chen), leader of hip-hop dance group Encore, meets rich kid Mianmian (Zhou Qiqi) when she enrols at a dance studio where he teaches. Mianmian's Latin dance partner-cum-fiance Ranqiu (Michael Tse) has asked her to take hip-hop lessons to expand her style so they can make a splash at a forthcoming competition in the U.S. Things don't go well at the start between the easygoing Letian and snooty Mianmian, and meanwhile Encore loses one of its key dancers, Wang Zi (Chiu Sheng-yi), when he signs a management contract with local dance-club owner Ye (Ma Jing) in order to pay his mother's medical bills. Between romancing Mianmian, Letian has to prove that Encore still has the goods.","popularity":0.001467,"poster_path":"/c0aYOZWY4SfCoi5zWYdZhYCCWjK.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"China Star Entertainment","id":3029},{"name":"One Hundred Years of Film Company","id":5633},{"name":"Tianjin Film Studio","id":14181},{"name":"Star Creative Multi-Media","id":14182}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2010-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kung Fu Hip Hop 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":13,"character":"Letian","credit_id":"53889ec2c3a3682f78000b81","id":64440,"name":"Chen Bolin","order":0,"profile_path":"/eRDmuLHY4mSOEsB6lHeisfVO951.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Mianmian","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c7513239d","id":543160,"name":"Zhou Qiqi","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Ranqiu","credit_id":"54a49998c3a3680b27010a00","id":21912,"name":"Michael Tse Tin-Wah","order":2,"profile_path":"/2kiRHdlbYHNN6tFOCyXypGUSZrG.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Prince","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323a1","id":1169727,"name":"Chiu Sheng-yi","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Red Sleeve","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323a5","id":1169728,"name":"Shi Tianqi","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Coco","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323a9","id":1169729,"name":"Lu Xiner","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323ad","id":1169730,"name":"Lin Zhenghao","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Momo","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323b1","id":1169731,"name":"Liu Meiman","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Ye","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323b5","id":1169732,"name":"Ma Jing","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Meat Bun","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323b9","id":1169733,"name":"Chen Jia","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Stallion","credit_id":"52fe4d2b9251416c751323bd","id":1169734,"name":"James Blackston","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"54a499cfc3a3682f2101319a","id":64439,"name":"Fan Bingbing","order":12,"profile_path":"/t9FrjxgEOac8u3iwDQmEjOAviZs.jpg"}],"crew":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Jing Mou Moon 2"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
