It is forbidden to listen to foreign radio stations, it is not safe to voice one’s opinions in front of strangers. Words of truth are spoken only in private kitchens behind the curtained windows. The KGB tap phones, survey the ‘unreliable’ and consistently step by step destroy all forms of decent. The protagonists challenge the inhumane state machine, putting on stake their very lives and proving that nothing and nobody can stop a person who is on his way to achieve a true freedom.","popularity":0.000957,"poster_path":"/c7WF9fGBpWZMyzVoq38FhsRTYf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds of Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54a962889251414d5d0049dd","id":235318,"name":"Andrey Kuzichev","order":1,"profile_path":"/yuvqf0Zi09SDJ4A4wGjTiXBgrp9.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54a96296c3a3680c30004af3","id":77667,"name":"Oksana Akinshina","order":2,"profile_path":"/sgG7JJIGOfCWEaoWnXPE5oZ3VnX.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54a962a2c3a3680c1e0047b1","id":1090481,"name":"Oleg Yankovskiy","order":3,"profile_path":"/Yp2PjSJJ8x76CE3x4nXJumTppa.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54a962af9251414d630047ea","id":1079977,"name":"Egor Pazenko","order":4,"profile_path":"/8Pq0QwZDa65ApzJjuveq8RdXSA6.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"54a962b9c3a3680c1c004a3c","id":1313020,"name":"Sergey Romanyuk","order":5,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a96256c3a3680c21004ec1","department":"Directing","id":545725,"job":"Director","name":"Roman Balayan","profile_path":"/7z8K7mWrFS2Kbn37ebWPXERboPs.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a962709251414d5d0049d9","department":"Writing","id":82798,"job":"Scenario Writer","name":"Rustam Ibragimbekov","profile_path":"/h2htMUQ76h6nineCHAtuNK0Hajn.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"ru","release_date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"ru","iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Pусский","english_name":"Russian"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
