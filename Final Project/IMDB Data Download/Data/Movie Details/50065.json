Dara is on top form as he effortlessly mixes off the cuff audience interaction with razor sharp material and a star studded finale that almost puts Hollywood to shame. \"O Briain is loud and large and fast and feisty...............but the way he tells 'em is a joy\" - The Times \"O Briain has a laser eye for the absurd and the spurious amid the too-much-stuff with which we shore up our hapless lives\" - The Guardian \"Breakneck genius...... the entire audience was hanging on every sentence. And every sentence ended in a laugh. It was stuffed with dazzling observations, vivid vignettes and glorious gags.\" Evening Standard","popularity":0.001419,"poster_path":"/psTAbgUBiLyPlhXM1RwwnlnETWx.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Open Mike Productions","id":2963}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dara O Briain: This Is the Show","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47b7c3a36847f8144795","id":94006,"name":"Dara Ó Briain","order":0,"profile_path":"/3cpoXyMgfW78N41Z8PJQP5aQR91.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe47b7c3a36847f8144799","id":16756,"name":"Jimi Mistry","order":1,"profile_path":"/zpesazswDICSbbaOenfMc1JvTnE.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Organist","credit_id":"52fe47b7c3a36847f814479d","id":146699,"name":"Richard Hills","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Announcer (voice)","credit_id":"52fe47b7c3a36847f81447a1","id":146700,"name":"Peter Dickson","order":3,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe47b7c3a36847f814478b","department":"Directing","id":66124,"job":"Director","name":"Paul Wheeler","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe47b7c3a36847f8144791","department":"Writing","id":94006,"job":"Writer","name":"Dara Ó Briain","profile_path":"/3cpoXyMgfW78N41Z8PJQP5aQR91.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dara O'Briain - This Is The Show"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
