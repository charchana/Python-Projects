At the peak of their creative art, Bob Mintzer (saxophone), Russell Ferrante (keyboards), Jimmy Haslip (bass) and Marcus Baylor (drums) played with the unaltered intensity &amp; jubilation of their 1981 debut when, as backing band for guitarist Robben Ford, they created the compelling, unmistakable Yellowjackets sound, combining bebop, funk, R&amp;B and rock influences. In the course of their 25 year career, the challenging team of improvising masters – 14 time Grammy Award nominees &amp; twice winners – has turned into a driving force in contemporary music. We are proud to offer the Yellowjackets' countless fans this jewel of musical sophistication &amp; groove!","popularity":0.000572,"poster_path":"/deZ4wwSpULDYCbm6u6BXcm4KKsV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yellowjackets: The Paris Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4babc3a368484e1941a7","department":"Directing","id":1096848,"job":"Director","name":"Martin Delton","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
