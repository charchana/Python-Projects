Set in 1987 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this movie tells the story a brand-new teacher and Mom who is given a tougher than expected teaching job and winds up teaching homeless children in a school that is housed in a room and called, literally, The School with No Name. She has some personal prejudicial hurdles to cross before she is able to be a true teacher for these children and of course there are hurdles like the lack of books and supplies.","popularity":0.101937,"poster_path":"/swBzRcQxJlI5iE8PFGbUUiQZcBh.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions","id":9027}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A  first-time teacher makes a difference in the lives of homeless children","title":"Beyond the Blackboard","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":15,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Stacey Bess","credit_id":"52fe463bc3a368484e08573b","id":84247,"name":"Emily VanCamp","order":0,"profile_path":"/1vpRa1vnzvPiNMLOq2IkS16ZKPc.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Greg Bess","credit_id":"53630ba80e0a261dfb001129","id":26975,"name":"Steve Talley","order":1,"profile_path":"/k0T00nPOY7K0Wocd5l7gfjoTJHF.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"52fe463bc3a368484e085743","id":530025,"name":"Willow Shields","order":2,"profile_path":"/c9Zna579entVQBdx7kTtKJjl9CB.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"School district's HR representative","credit_id":"52fe463bc3a368484e085747","id":23881,"name":"Timothy Busfield","order":3,"profile_path":"/8sQr5B1h0wJ4kOcTgwWyCDfzzYq.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Johnny Hernandez","credit_id":"52fe463bc3a368484e08574b","id":17413,"name":"Julio Oscar Mechoso","order":4,"profile_path":"/gilHqoYdYoYMcVIK81QiqOeJcc6.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Candy","credit_id":"52fe463bc3a368484e08574f","id":42374,"name":"Nicki Aycox","order":5,"profile_path":"/nuq3ChJ6arKPgpM3MTnaE4bgavn.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Danny's Mom","credit_id":"53dcb6a30e0a26481c001fbc","id":23504,"name":"Kiersten Warren","order":6,"profile_path":"/nzbUkAYhC6x3Zwdmm93nusN5vg6.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Warren","credit_id":"52fe463bc3a368484e085757","id":4515,"name":"Treat Williams","order":7,"profile_path":"/uKejRJTEVOy6IOsJX2mJH3SwbTl.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"5442b185c3a3683e05002821","department":"Directing","id":69982,"job":"Director","name":"Jeff Bleckner","profile_path":"/8mgbryrtiwKvEeQe8K1aaQP2B04.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nobody Don't Love Nobody by Stacey Bess"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Let Them Shine"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Mas alla de la pizarra"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hallmark Hall of Fame: Beyond the Blackboard"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"nl","iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Nederlands","english_name":"Dutch"},{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"he","iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"עִבְרִית","english_name":"Hebrew"},{"iso_639_1":"pt","iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Português","english_name":"Portuguese"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"tr","iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Türkçe","english_name":"Turkish"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10103,"name":"children"},{"id":10508,"name":"teacher"},{"id":10873,"name":"school"}]}}
