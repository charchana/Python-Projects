After the wars of 1848, a retired Austrian army officer \"returns to the soil\" as a gentleman farmer in Hungary in the 1850s. The old campaigner is the father of two daughters: One of the girls comes to a sad end thanks to the malfeasances of a handsome spy, but the other has a happier fate when she falls in love with a Hungarian POW. The underlying theme is brotherhood, as the formerly warring Austrians and Hungarians at last find a common ground. Az Uj Foldesur was nearly twice as expensive as the average Hungarian film -- but at $40,000, its budget was a drop in the bucket compared to a typical Hollywood production.","popularity":0.000215,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New Landlord","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a9c10ac3a3680c300056b8","department":"Directing","id":124074,"job":"Director","name":"Béla Gaál","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
