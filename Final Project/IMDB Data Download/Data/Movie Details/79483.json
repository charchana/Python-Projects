Star of hit TV shows 8 Out of 10 Cats and 10 O’clock Live, Jimmy is well known for his slick one liners and non-stop gags, but his acerbic wit and fast-paced comedy style are at their brilliant best when he has the stage to himself. Packed with over 100 minutes of brand new material, including too-rude-for-TV jokes, hilarious heckling, and even better put-downs, Jimmy pushes the boundaries of comedy and delivers a spectacular show.","popularity":0.038365,"poster_path":"/PBf9flyZkkWDUFnFLfMII6YQFt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jimmy Carr: Being Funny","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":6,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e14260d","id":59077,"name":"Jimmy Carr","order":0,"profile_path":"/wSixtNPZCQb4TaRVHym7lZ6RnZG.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e142613","department":"Production","id":84742,"job":"Producer","name":"Sam Pinnell","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e142619","department":"Production","id":84740,"job":"Executive Producer","name":"Iain Morris","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e14261f","department":"Production","id":84739,"job":"Executive Producer","name":"Damon Beesley","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe49d5c3a368484e142625","department":"Directing","id":66124,"job":"Director","name":"Paul Wheeler","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jimmy Carr: Being Funny"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Jimmy Carr - Being Funny"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"nl","iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Nederlands","english_name":"Dutch"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
