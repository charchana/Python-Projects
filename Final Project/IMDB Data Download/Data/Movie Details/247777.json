Their favourite activity: talking endlessly. During a series of vacation days filled with sun-drenched naps, squabbling, waterskiing competitions and love-making, the amateur actors discuss their concerns in dry dialogues. For instance, semi-intellectual reflections on the end of time and how Michael Jordan plays basketball.","popularity":0.013716,"poster_path":"/iAMgT1c1t5vdrnOrWsSHliLWDCt.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Special Affects films","id":79858}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L for Leisure","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"543c5507c3a3681998005f2a","id":1195458,"name":"Gabriel Abrantes","order":1,"profile_path":"/tHPD5HfrFf1o7CHVCDPoIOvChKD.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"543c55120e0a2649b60068ab","id":1373659,"name":"Melissa Barrera","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"543c551f0e0a2649a100678e","id":1288329,"name":"Bene Coopersmith","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"543c552bc3a368198c00651d","id":1373660,"name":"Benjamin Crotty","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"543c55380e0a2649b20062f6","id":1373661,"name":"Carolyn Cutillo","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"543c5545c3a36819890060c0","id":1373662,"name":"Mira de Jong","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"543c55500e0a2649ab00652f","id":136168,"name":"Mati Diop","order":7,"profile_path":"/v7oTHTA9AONIwEfTHZHXeVr3mVM.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c2307","department":"Directing","id":1283213,"job":"Director","name":"Lev Kalman","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c230d","department":"Directing","id":1283214,"job":"Director","name":"Whitney Horn","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"579ca167c3a3681da3000e77","department":"Writing","id":1283213,"job":"Writer","name":"Lev Kalman","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"579ca171c3a3681dd2001016","department":"Writing","id":1283214,"job":"Writer","name":"Whitney Horn","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"Fran√ßais","english_name":"French"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]}}
