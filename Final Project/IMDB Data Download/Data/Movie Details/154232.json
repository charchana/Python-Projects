As the old saying goes though, you can't run away from your past and the couple soon find themselves the target of a rather unpleasant gang. When Rodney is framed and put in prison, Janet is left to look after their son alone. Meanwhile, back at the clan, the Ninjas are facing a fierce internal struggle as the dastardly Stewart attempts a takeover. When Gordon returns from a mission, he soon uncovers the truth and the stage is set for a final face off of epic proportions.","popularity":0.001845,"poster_path":"/2MdFkLO88vicK99OgOCLFjgJUpL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ninja Commandments","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":5,"character":"Ninja Master Gordon","credit_id":"52fe4b589251416c910d78e9","id":32673,"name":"Richard Harrison","order":0,"profile_path":"/ziX9ffr30cRS5g4Mz8uEe0SX10F.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d78ed","id":147978,"name":"Dave Wheeler","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d78f1","id":1134901,"name":"Peter KÃ¦r","order":2,"profile_path":"/7ROragWyw6sJJqMd4LIuXJlKwYf.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d78f5","id":937060,"name":"Adam Frank","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d78f9","id":553867,"name":"Louis Roth","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d78fd","id":1043245,"name":"Yang Hui-San","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d7901","id":1134902,"name":"Hsiao-fei Li","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d7909","id":1134904,"name":"Paul Huisintyeld","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d790d","id":1134905,"name":"Timothy Alberto","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d7911","id":1134906,"name":"Teddy Ngai","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b599251416c910d7915","id":1134907,"name":"Christine","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"56acd639c3a3681c34005bb3","id":1175528,"name":"Ma Sha","order":12,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4b589251416c910d78d3","department":"Directing","id":147794,"job":"Director","name":"Joseph Lai","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4b589251416c910d78d9","department":"Directing","id":147793,"job":"Director","name":"Godfrey Ho","profile_path":"/ymaW3vW3zoLdqHI5YWfH5domxP3.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe4b589251416c910d78df","department":"Writing","id":1134900,"job":"Writer","name":"AAV Creative Unit","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4b589251416c910d78e5","department":"Writing","id":147793,"job":"Writer","name":"Godfrey Ho","profile_path":"/ymaW3vW3zoLdqHI5YWfH5domxP3.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10278,"name":"ninja"}]}}
