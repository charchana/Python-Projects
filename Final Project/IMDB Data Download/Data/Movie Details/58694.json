Verjeat's pursuit of the councilman, Lardatte, gets him a warning from his superiors. When he embarrasses Lardatte while disarming a hostage (the dead volunteer's father), Verjeat is told he's being transferred within a week. He speeds up his hunt for the goon and, with Lefévre, one of his young detectives, he engineers a complicated scheme to buy more time before the transfer. How should Verjeat play out his values of honor and duty?","popularity":0.068823,"poster_path":"/9HrTZxCnQ8Wz7OdVbqkjeMicgwP.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Mondex Films","id":1772},{"name":"Les Films Ariane","id":7110}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1975-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The French Detective","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Verjeat","credit_id":"52fe4970c3a36847f819a19d","id":15397,"name":"Lino Ventura","order":0,"profile_path":"/7LALgVuvaZLzXToZoxS4vWRNknl.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"lefebvre","credit_id":"52fe4970c3a36847f819a1a1","id":34581,"name":"Patrick Dewaere","order":1,"profile_path":"/ytZv7q55p8FgWAi3HgtqDwgc20E.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Lardatte","credit_id":"52fe4970c3a36847f819a1a5","id":25180,"name":"Victor Lanoux","order":2,"profile_path":"/lYZPAXvD0g8accWbxX5oTRdJQr2.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Le contrôleur général Ledoux","credit_id":"52fe4970c3a36847f819a1af","id":11216,"name":"Julien Guiomar","order":3,"profile_path":"/zbgWU6iMHhn8aApkwgmpvjG3vRT.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"le commissaire Pignol","credit_id":"52fe4970c3a36847f819a1b3","id":589521,"name":"Pierre Tornade","order":4,"profile_path":"/qNF1YHzzCr0eqsZXRMvnpa9yeJz.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4970c3a36847f819a1ab","department":"Directing","id":32096,"job":"Director","name":"Pierre Granier-Deferre","profile_path":"/eDLmU2QhLHYeHBw6YdhmwgjAsuO.jpg"},{"credit_id":"5730f6a69251413fb800077b","department":"Writing","id":1183957,"job":"Novel","name":"Jean Laborde","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5730f6af9251413fb2000816","department":"Writing","id":38507,"job":"Writer","name":"Francis Veber","profile_path":"/hEeR4kyKecepNaEb4sdK0pAQKzf.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"So Long Copper"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"Français","english_name":"French"},{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"ru","iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Pусский","english_name":"Russian"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156808,"name":"hospital fight"},{"id":170217,"name":"held hostage"}]}}
