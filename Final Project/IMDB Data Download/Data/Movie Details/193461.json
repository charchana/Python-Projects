It's a completely unmotivated but thoroughly spooky encounter between Mayuko and a demonic ghost, and she's saved by an ancient priest spirit who explains her legacy. \"Why does this always happen to me?\" she ponders before flying off to a remote island to investigate an ancient curse and battle a legendary Sea Demon. Mayuko befriends a burly, chivalrous detective and a little orphan boy nicknamed \"the Devil's Child\" who hides his own dark secret.","popularity":0.0003,"poster_path":"/6aDFrp62prLK3uquz9XBIVkSTj2.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"GAGA","id":3656}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beneath the waves...
