Their task is complicated by a sassy nursemaid and, unbeknownst to them, the impatient Prof. von Schwarzenhoffen himself. But the biggest problem is the force of gravity, which repeatedly pulls the piano back down to the bottom of the stairs. Finally, the irate Professor explodes in fury to discover the \"mechanical blunderbuss\" in his home, not knowing it was a surprise birthday present from his wife.","popularity":0.119536,"poster_path":"/lj97Rus3XN5kVLnxExxE6BuVFy1.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Hal Roach Studios","id":2159}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy decided to reorganize and resupervise their entire financial structure- so they took the $3.80 and went into business.","title":"The Music Box","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":32,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Stan","credit_id":"52fe46a2c3a36847f81099fb","id":89670,"name":"Stan Laurel","order":0,"profile_path":"/cYrYC6qpRng0aB34zscpxMGxdx3.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Ollie","credit_id":"52fe46a2c3a36847f81099ff","id":78057,"name":"Oliver Hardy","order":1,"profile_path":"/rNNQcmqGONwOc4d3adhQD57T2jm.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Susie the Horse (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa3a5dc3a3680c1e006354","id":141063,"name":"Dinah","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. von Schwarzenhoffen (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa3a869251414d670060db","id":1250237,"name":"Gladys Gale","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Professor von Schwarzenhoffen (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa3ac09251415757000e70","id":5464,"name":"Billy Gilbert","order":4,"profile_path":"/pITSLDLWwStge8KwizNn2VZdN9c.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Piano Salesman (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa3ad2c3a3680c30006865","id":141132,"name":"William Gillespie","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Postman (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa3ae3c3a368077b003e4c","id":137404,"name":"Charlie Hall","order":6,"profile_path":"/vttfiluEvKP7hZIcSCmrLqK07jj.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Nursemaid (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa3af49251417e0600350a","id":1409154,"name":"Lilyan Irene","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Policeman (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa3b04c3a3680c1e006365","id":141008,"name":"Sam Lufkin","order":8,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe46a2c3a36847f8109a05","department":"Directing","id":140815,"job":"Director","name":"James Parrott","profile_path":"/tug38sUl1qUnhquCjCyrjUrrQGX.jpg"},{"credit_id":"5680990192514131df00c5b0","department":"Writing","id":131383,"job":"Dialogue","name":"H.M.
