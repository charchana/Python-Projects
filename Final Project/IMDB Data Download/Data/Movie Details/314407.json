Cocaine Cowboys is the true story of how Miami became the drug, murder and cash capital of the United States. But it isn't the whole story - Pulling from hundreds of hours of additional interviews and recently uncovered archival news footage, Cocaine Cowboys has been RELOADED: packed with footage and stories that have never been told about Griselda Blanco, the Medell√≠n Cartel, and Miami's Cocaine Wars, with firsthand accounts by hit man Jorge 'Rivi' Ayala, cocaine trafficker Jon Roberts, smuggler Mickey Munday, and others. Cocaine Cowboys: Reloaded recreates Miami's Cocaine Wars like you've never experienced it.","popularity":0.043301,"poster_path":"/sQ46KBfUS4Xh91VTGLyL9DwQ9tW.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Rakontur","id":6303}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Miami became the cocaine capital of the United States!","title":"Cocaine Cowboys: Reloaded","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":8,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a964bf9251417e80001e86","department":"Directing","id":141475,"job":"Director","name":"Billy Corben","profile_path":"/qxHKSiPNiGnlOgf5t6JqkHCkvwX.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
