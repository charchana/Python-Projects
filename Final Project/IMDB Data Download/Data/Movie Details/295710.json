Turning out wildly catchy singles like Maps and Moves Like Jagger, Maroon 5 shifts effortlessly between R&amp;B-influenced ballads, soaring pop anthems, and heart-racing dance-rock.  The guys and I are excited to be part of this year’s iTunes Festival. It’s an amazing Festival and we are really looking forward to performing alongside so many great artists.
