However, returning to his home after work on his birthday, he finds his house deserted and darkened with almost all the lightbulbs missing, all easy access outside cut off and a videotape waiting for him. Playing that tape, he watches a bizarre and grueling recording in which his wife explains her grievance with him, her reasons for disappearing with the children and her revenge for how he treated her in a way he would never forget.","popularity":0.144667,"poster_path":"/yeGTLsN8g3XfE1a0HzB6IRkf0vU.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Vertigo
