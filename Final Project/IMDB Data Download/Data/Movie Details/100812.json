Sayer admits that he has murdered several women after the same ordeal, always killing them at the point of orgasm. But all is not what it seems, and this is revealed to be the fantasy of a troubled man. Sayer finds salvation in Maria and falls for her, only for her to turn the tables on him and ultimately reveal that she too is not what she seems.","popularity":0.002399,"poster_path":"/8Bv3Z5mOTrrmvh9onLv78aSa7wb.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Cemo Film","id":10475}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1969-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Laughing Woman","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"52fe49e1c3a36847f81ab7ad","id":46636,"name":"Dagmar Lassander","order":0,"profile_path":"/z5sdtXsr0hUAUtiIXzb94FS511s.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Sayer","credit_id":"52fe49e1c3a36847f81ab7b1","id":25333,"name":"Philippe Leroy","order":1,"profile_path":"/1LUvDUsO6mxUBVXSjuGbyKESzDI.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Administrator","credit_id":"52fe49e1c3a36847f81ab7b9","id":1168849,"name":"Varo Soleri","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Sayer's Secretary","credit_id":"52fe49e1c3a36847f81ab7bd","id":99792,"name":"Maria Cumani Quasimodo","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Streetwalker","credit_id":"52fe49e1c3a36847f81ab7c1","id":995741,"name":"Mirella Pamphili","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Gida","credit_id":"54a7f4ec9251414d5b001b5c","id":31613,"name":"Lorenza Guerrieri","order":6,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe49e1c3a36847f81ab7a9","department":"Directing","id":128924,"job":"Director","name":"Piero Schivazappa","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"564a7bc8c3a3686024001263","department":"Sound","id":29501,"job":"Original Music Composer","name":"Stelvio Cipriani","profile_path":"/lMk2Iwbq2RcvCZd9UJw0QtT74VZ.jpg"},{"credit_id":"57da11eac3a36879eb000477","department":"Editing","id":44967,"job":"Editor","name":"Carlo Reali","profile_path":"/fc5LTUaduPG1U24UB7jqQgg12j6.jpg"},{"credit_id":"57da11c492514150d6000549","department":"Production","id":44985,"job":"Producer","name":"Giuseppe Zaccariello","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da11bbc3a36879d9000486","department":"Writing","id":44985,"job":"Writer","name":"Giuseppe Zaccariello","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da11b4c3a36879e7000405","department":"Writing","id":128924,"job":"Writer","name":"Piero Schivazappa","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da11a1c3a36879eb000462","department":"Writing","id":1088500,"job":"Writer","name":"Paolo Levi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da11db92514150dd0004f3","department":"Camera","id":1679182,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Carlo Achilli","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da11e392514150dd0004fb","department":"Camera","id":1123363,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Sante Achilli","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da11f3c3a36879dd0004d0","department":"Art","id":1024748,"job":"Production Design","name":"Francesco Cuppini","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da11fa92514150d100048c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","id":14590,"job":"Costume Design","name":"Enrico Sabbatini","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da1202c3a36879d9000498","department":"Sound","id":1560818,"job":"Sound Mixer","name":"Mario Morigi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57da120b92514150d100048f","department":"Crew","id":20504,"job":"Special Effects","name":"Carlo Rambaldi","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","release_date":"1969-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"New York City","release_date":"1970-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Frightened Woman"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Laughing Woman"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
