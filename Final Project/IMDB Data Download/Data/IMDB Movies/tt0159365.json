Law has been nominated for two Academy Awards and continues to build a prolific body of work that spans from early successes such as Gattaca (1997) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) to more recent turns as Dr. John Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), as Hugo's father in Hugo (2011) and in the titular role in Dom Hemingway (2013). David Jude Law was born on December 29, 1972 in Lewisham, London, England, to Margaret Anne (Heyworth) and Peter Robert Law, both of whom taught at comprehensive schools; his father later became a headmaster. Law has said that he was named after both the book Jude the Obscure and the song Hey Jude. In 1992, Jude began his stage career. He starred in many plays throughout London, and was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award of \"Outstanding Newcomer\" After doing the play \"Indiscretions\" in London, he moved and did it again on Broadway. This time, he was alongside Kathleen Turner. He then received a Tony Nomination for \"Outstanding Supporting Actor\". He was then rewarded the Theatre World Award. After Broadway, Jude started on the big screen, in many independent films. His first big-named movie was Gattaca (1997), with Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. He also had a good role in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997). Jude's latest rise to fame has been because of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), in which he plays Matt Damon's obsession. The film did very well at the box office, and critics loved Jude's acting. Following the success of Gattaca (1997) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Law's feature film career continued to gain momentum throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s with roles in such films as Enemy at the Gates (2001), Road to Perdition (2002), I Heart Huckabees (2004), Aviator (2004) and many others. Law is one of three actors, along with Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp, to take over acting responsibilities in the Terry Gilliam project The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) following Heath Ledger's death. Law is a partner in the production company \"Natural Nylon\". His partners include Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan McGregor and his ex-wife Sadie Frost. Law has been active in many charitable activities and supports several different foundations and causes, doing work for organizations including the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Make Poverty History, Breast Cancer Care and others. Law is also a peace advocate, and in 2011, participated in street protests against the rule of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus. Law married Sadie Frost in 1997 and the couple had two sons (Rafferty and Rudy) and a daughter (Iris) before divorcing in 2003. Law and Alfie (2004) co-star Sienna Miller were engaged to be married in 2005 and separated in 2006 (they would later rekindle their relationship in 2009, splitting once again in 2011). Law and American model Samantha Burke had a brief relationship in 2008 that resulted in the birth of Law's fourth child, daughter Sophia. Law's fifth child, with an ex-girlfriend, Catherine Harding, was born in 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTg5NTQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM3MDAzNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000179","name":"Jude Law","idIMDB":"nm0000179"},"actorId":"nm0000179","character":"Inman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009331","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicole Kidman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000173","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MjM5NDg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg1OTQ4Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 June 1967","placeOfBirth":" Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","birthName":"Nicole Mary Kidman","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Elegant blonde Nicole Kidman, known as one of Hollywood's top Australian imports, was actually born in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were there on educational visas. Kidman is the daughter of Janelle Ann (Glenny), a nursing instructor, and Antony David Kidman, a biochemist and clinical psychologist. She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole's first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite Bush Christmas (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in Le gang des BMX (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Calme blanc (1989). Kidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise's doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Days of Thunder (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting (1991), then as Dustin Hoffman's moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate (1991). She reunited with Cruise for Far and Away (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger My Life (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant's To Die For (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion, on the adaptation of Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in The Peacemaker (1997), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire. She and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick's sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MjM5NDg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg1OTQ4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000173","name":"Nicole Kidman","nicknames":["Nic"],"idIMDB":"nm0000173"},"actorId":"nm0000173","character":"Ada Monroe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009329","main":true},{"actorName":"Renée Zellweger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000250","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMzYwMDI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg3NjYwMzE@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 April 1969","placeOfBirth":" Katy, Texas, USA","birthName":"Renée Kathleen Zellweger","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Renée Kathleen Zellweger was born on April 25, 1969, in Katy, Texas, USA. Her mother, Kjellfrid Irene (Andreassen), is a Norwegian-born former nurse and midwife, of Norwegian, Kven (Finnish), and Swedish descent. Her father, Emil Erich Zellweger, is a Swiss-born engineer. The two married in 1963. Renée has a brother named Drew Zellweger, a marketing executive born on February 15, 1967. Renée got interested in acting in high school while working on the drama club. She also took an acting class at the University of Texas (Austin), where she began looking towards acting as a career. After graduation, she wanted to continue acting, but Hollywood is a tough town to break into, so Renée decided to stay in Texas, and auditioned for roles around Houston, where she managed to grab roles in such films as Reality Bites (1994) and Empire Records (1995). While on the set for the sequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994), she befriended Matthew McConaughey, another Hollywood up-and-comer. He was working on a project at the time that Renée was interested in, auditioned for, and won the role in the film Love and a .45 (1994), which earned her enough critical praise that she decided to move to Los Angeles. Another role in The Whole Wide World (1996) followed which led to her big break. Cameron Crowe was busy casting his next film, Jerry Maguire (1996), starring Tom Cruise. Crowe was considering such actresses as Cameron Diaz, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder, and Marisa Tomei, when he heard of Zellweger's performance in The Whole Wide World (1996). He auditioned Zellweger and was sure he'd found his Dorothy Boyd. Renée followed her huge success with a few small independent films and after receiving further critical praise, she felt confident enough to reenter the world of big-budget Hollywood films. She starred opposite Meryl Streep in the tear-jerker One True Thing (1998). She also took a role in Me, Myself & Irene (2000), opposite Jim Carrey, and soon after began dating Carrey. The two denied their relationship at first, but finally gave in and admitted it; today they are no longer together. Also in 2000, she starred in the title role in Nurse Betty (2000), where she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical. In 2001, she received even more critical and commercial success in the title role in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). She received her first Academy Award nomination for her role, which was followed by her second Oscar-nominated role in the musical Chicago (2002). She then again wowed audiences with her fierce yet warm portrayal of Ruby Thewes in the film adaptation of Cold Mountain (2003), which won Zellweger an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which was her first Academy Award.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMzYwMDI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg3NjYwMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000250","name":"Renée Zellweger","nicknames":["Zelly"],"idIMDB":"nm0000250"},"actorId":"nm0000250","character":"Ruby Thewes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009333","main":true},{"actorName":"Eileen Atkins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0040586","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0ODU4MTQ3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg0MzMwMg@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 June 1934","placeOfBirth":" Clapton, London, England, UK","birthName":"Eileen June Atkins","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Eileen Atkins was born in a Salvation Army Women's Hostel in north London.

From a very young age, he loved to learn, especially reading classical text in and outside the classroom. He took great attention to Irish play writers such as Samuel Beckett, which eventually led to him performing in his high school play production of \"Waiting for Godot\", and paying great attention to detail in his high school drama classes. Upon finishing 12th grade, he spent a couple of years with the Dublin Shakespeare Festival, and under the advice of a director there, headed across to London and auditioned for drama schools. Soon to follow, he was invited to audition for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avon, and spent a couple of seasons back in England on the stage. He then, at the age of thirty five, decided to audition for films in the UK and began to build a very respectable resume playing many different diverse characters. He made his debut as a quarryman in The Field (1990). He had several small roles in major Hollywood movies based in Ireland, such as Far and Away (1992) and Le cheval venu de la mer (1992). Memorably played historical Irish figure \"Michael Collins\" in The Treaty (1991). Made his breakthrough in Scottish themed Braveheart (1995), which was largely filmed in Ireland, opposite Mel Gibson. He played Gibson's right-hand man \"Hamish\". Since then, he has appeared in numerous major films such as Mission: Impossible II (2000), Lake Placid (1999), Turbulence (1997). He has made a name for himself taking the titular role in The General (1998), based on the life of Irish criminal \"Martin Cahill\", for which he won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award. He appears in director John Boorman's film The Tailor of Panama (2001) as well as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). Ever since, he has continued to bring his huge stage presence to the screen, always delivering the character in full development to his audience. He is married to his lovely wife, Mary, since 1982.

He was the son of Marilyn (Loucks), a lawyer and judge, and Gordon Stowell Hoffman, a Xerox employee, and was mostly of German, Irish, English and Dutch ancestry. After becoming involved in high school theatrics, he attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, graduating with a B.F.A. degree in Drama in 1989. He made his feature film debut in the indie production Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole (1991) as Phil Hoffman, and his first role in a major release came the next year in My New Gun (1992). While he had supporting roles in some other major productions like Scent of a Woman (1992) and Twister (1996), his breakthrough role came in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997). He quickly became an icon of indie cinema, establishing a reputation as one of the screen's finest actors, in a variety of supporting and second leads in indie and major features, including Todd Solondz's Happiness (1998), Flawless (1999), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999), Almost Famous (2000) and Séquences et conséquences (2000). He also appeared in supporting roles in such mainstream, big-budget features as Dragon rouge (2002), Cold Mountain (2003) and Mission: Impossible III (2006). Hoffman was also quite active on the stage. On Broadway, he has earned two Tony nominations, as Best Actor (Play) in 2000 for a revival of Sam Shepard's \"True West\" and as Best Actor (Featured Role - Play) in 2003 for a revival of Eugene O'Neill (I)'s \"Long Day's Journey into Night\". His other acting credits in the New York theater include \"The Seagull\" (directed by Mike Nichols for The New York Shakespeare Festival), \"Defying Gravity\", \"The Merchant of Venice\" (directed by Peter Sellars), \"Shopping and F*@%ing\" and \"The Author's Voice\" (Drama Desk nomination). He is the Co-Artistic Director of the LAByrinth Theater Company in New York, for which he directed \"Our Lady of 121st Street\" by Stephen Adly Guirgis. He also has directed \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Jesus Hopped the A Train\" by Guirgis for LAByrinth, and \"The Glory of Living\" by Rebecca Gilman at the Manhattan Class Company. Hoffman consolidated his reputation as one of the finest actors under the age of 40 with his turn in the title role of Capote (2005), for which he won the Los Angeles Film Critics Award as Best Actor. In 2006, he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar for the same role. On February 2, 2014, Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in an apartment in Greenwich village, New York. Investigators found Hoffman with a syringe in his arm and two open envelopes of heroin next to him. Mr. Hoffman was long known to struggle with addiction. In 2006, he said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that he had given up drugs and alcohol many years earlier, when he was age 22. In 2013, he checked into a rehabilitation program for about 10 days after a reliance on prescription pills resulted in his briefly turning again to heroin.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NTA1NTg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxNzgxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000450","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","nicknames":["Phil"],"idIMDB":"nm0000450"},"actorId":"nm0000450","character":"Reverend Veasey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009335","main":true},{"actorName":"Natalie Portman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000204","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODE3Mjg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA4ODcxNA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 June 1981","placeOfBirth":" Jerusalem, Israel","birthName":"Natalie Hershlag","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Natalie Portman is the first person born in the 1980s to have won the Academy Award for Best Actress (for Black Swan (2010)).

He has appeared in almost 200 different shows and films. He is also the father of renowned actor Kiefer Sutherland, among others. Donald McNichol Sutherland was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, to Dorothy Isobel (McNichol) and Frederick McLea Sutherland, who worked in sales and electricity. He has Scottish, as well as German and English, ancestry. Sutherland worked several different jobs - he was a radio DJ in his youth - and was almost set on becoming an engineer after graduating from the University of Toronto with a degree in engineering. However, he also graduated with a degree in drama, and he chose to abandon becoming an engineer in favour of an actor. Sutherland's first roles were bit parts and consisted of such films as the horror film Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965) which starred Christopher Lee. He was also appearing in episodes of TV shows such as \"The Saint\" and \"Court Martial\". Sutherland's break would come soon, though, and it would come in the form of a war film in which he was barely cast. The reason he was barely cast was because he had been a last-minute replacement for an actor that had dropped out of the film. The role he played was that of the dopey but loyal Vernon Pinkley in the war film The Dirty Dozen (1967). The film also starred Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, and Telly Savalas. The picture was an instant success as an action/war film, and Sutherland played upon this success by taking another role in a war film: this was, however, a comedy called MASH (1970) which landed Sutherland the starring role alongside Elliott Gould and Tom Skerritt. This is now considered a classic among film goers, and the 35-year old actor was only getting warmed up. Sutherland took a number of other roles in between these two films, such as the theatrical adaptation Oedipus the King (1968), the musical Joanna (1968) and the Clint Eastwood-helmed war comedy Kelly's Heroes (1970). It was Kelly's Heroes (1970) that became more well-known, and it reunited Sutherland with Telly Savalas. 1970 and 1971 offered Sutherland a number of other films, the best of them would have to be Klute (1971). The film, which made Jane Fonda a star, is about a prostitute whose friend is mysteriously murdered. Sutherland received no critical acclaim like his co-star Fonda (she won an Oscar) but his career did not fade. Moving on from Klute (1971), Sutherland landed roles such as the lead in the thriller Lady Ice (1973), and another lead in the western Alien Thunder (1974). These films did not match up to \"Klute\"'s success, though Sutherland took a supporting role that would become one of his most infamous and most critically acclaimed. He played the role of the murderous fascist leader in the Bernardo Bertolucci Italian epic 1900 (1976). Sutherland also gained another memorable role as a marijuana-smoking university professor in Animal House (1978) among other work that he did in this time. Another classic role came in the form of the Robert Redford film, Ordinary People (1980). Sutherland portrays an older father figure who must deal with his children in an emotional drama of a film. It won Best Picture, and while both the supporting stars were nominated for Oscars, Sutherland once again did not receive any Academy Award nomination. He moved on to play a Nazi spy in a film based on Ken Follett's book \"Eye of the Needle\" and he would star alongside Al Pacino in the commercial and critical disaster that was Revolution (1985). While it drove Al Pacino out of films for four years, Sutherland continued to find work. This work led to the dramatic, well-told story of apartheid A Dry White Season (1989) alongside the legendary actor Marlon Brando. Sutherland's next big success came in the Oliver Stone film JFK (1991) where Sutherland plays the chilling role of Mister X, an anonymous source who gives crucial information about the politics surrounding President Kennedy. Once again, he was passed over at the Oscars, though Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for his performance as Clay Shaw. Sutherland went on to appear in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), Shadow of the Wolf (1992), and Disclosure (1994). The new millennium provided an interesting turn in Sutherland's career: reuniting with such former collaborators as Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones, Sutherland starred in Space Cowboys (2000). He also appeared as the father figure to Nicole Kidman's character in Cold Mountain (2003) and Charlize Theron's character in The Italian Job (2003). He has also made a fascinating, Oscar-worthy performance as the revolutionist Mr. Thorne in Land of the Blind (2006) and also as a judge in Reign Over Me (2007). Recently, he has joined forces with his son Rossif Sutherland and Canadian comic [error] with the new comedy The Con Artist (2010), as well as acting alongside Jamie Bell and Channing Tatum in the sword-and-sandal film The Eagle (2011). Sutherland has also taken a role in the remake of Charles Bronson's film The Mechanic (1972). Donald Sutherland has made a lasting legacy on Hollywood, whether portraying a chilling and horrifying villain, or playing the older respectable character in his films. A true character actor, Sutherland is one of Canada's most well-known names and will hopefully continue on being so long after his time.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MDI1NzcyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0MjQwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661","name":"Donald Sutherland","idIMDB":"nm0000661"},"actorId":"nm0000661","character":"Reverend Monroe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009336","main":true},{"actorName":"Ray Winstone","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935653","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NTM2MTU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAzNTQyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 February 1957","placeOfBirth":" Hackney, London, England, UK","birthName":"Raymond Andrew Winstone","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Ray Winstone was born on February 19, 1957, in Hackney Hospital in London, England, to Margaret (Richardson) and Raymond J. Winstone. He moved to Enfield, at age seven, where his parents had a fruit and vegetable business. He started boxing at the age of twelve at the famous Repton Amateur Boxing Club, was three times London Schoolboy Champion and fought twice for England, UK. In ten years of boxing, he won over 80 medals and trophies. Ray studied acting at the Corona School before being cast by director Alan Clarke as Carlin in the BBC Play production of Scum (1979). He has appeared in numerous TV series over the past 20 years including Robin Hood (1984), Palmer (1991), Birds of a Feather (1989), Between the Lines (1992), Ghostbusters of East Finchley (1995), Births, Marriages and Deaths (1999), and Vincent (2005).

The comely blonde was born Katherine Whitton Baker in Midland, Texas, the daughter of parents John Seawand Baker, a geologist and educator who taught at both the University of Paris and at Princeton, and Helene Andree Baker (née Whitton). Raised in New Mexico, she first took to the stage at age 10. Influenced by her French-born mother, Kathy attended the University of California at Berkeley and instead received her Bachelor of Arts degree in French in 1977. From there she went to Paris to study haute cuisine at the famed Cordon Bleu. She returned to the States originally to work as a pastry chef, but still discovered a smouldering desire to act and eventually joined San Francisco's Magic Theatre. There she appeared in the play \"The Man Who Killed the Buddha\" and gave a performance that drew the immediate attention of playwright Sam Shepard. 1983 was a banner year for Kathy. At the Magic Theatre, wherein she used the stage name of Kathy Whitton Baker, Shepard cast her in a leading role in one of his new plays, \"Fool for Love.\" The premiere garnered exceptional notices and the play (and Kathy) went to New York. She and co-star Ed Harris, won 1984 Obie Awards for their rich performances, as did playwright Shepard for directing. The production itself won the Obie for \"Best New American Play.\" That same year Kathy made a strong movie debut co-starring in The Right Stuff (1983) as the wife of astronaut Alan Shepard (played by Scott Glenn). Displaying an attractive intelligence in her performances, Kathy continued to make strides on the New York stage both in 1984's \"Desire Under the Elms\" and as a replacement for the Lemon character in the Obie-winning \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\" at Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival in 1986. Later in the decade, both Kathy and Morgan Freeman stole the thunder right from under star Christopher Reeve in the tense film drama Street Smart (1987) with Kathy delivering a grim, heartfelt performance as an ill-fated hooker to Freeman's feral pimp. Both perfs delivered a one-two punch and were applauded for their shocking realism. Each received their share of awards and plaudits; Kathy nabbed both the National Society of Critics and Boston Society of Critics awards, but was shamefully snubbed when it came to the Oscar race (Freeman was nominated, but lost). Throughout the rest of the decade Kathy continued to give spot-on performances in such quality films as Clean and Sober (1988), as a recovering addict; Permanent Record (1988), as a wife whose son commits suicide; Jacknife (1989), in which she was reunited with Ed Harris as the put-upon, plain-Jane sister of an alcoholic Vietnam vet; and Edward Scissorhands (1990) as a seemingly model housewife who has an uncontrollably flirtatious nature. Top-flight stardom seemed to be almost a given. With the new decade, however, the movie roles tendered out to her became less frequent or noteworthy so Kathy decided to focus outside her medium of choice and actively search for TV roles. The results were customarily expert. In the slightly quirky Picket Fences (1992), Kathy found a perfect fit taking on the role of small town mother and doctor Jill Brock. Running for four seasons, she was nominated for an Emmy each year and took home the trophy three of those four times for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series\". Into the millennium Kathy has maintained consistency with quality roles in the more recent releases Cold Mountain (2003) and The Jane Austen Book Club (2007). On TV she and Helen Mirren picked up supporting Emmy nods in the bittersweet Door to Door (2002), with Emmy-winning William H. Macy starring as a man with cerebral palsy. In 2001 she joined the cast of Boston Public (2000) as a manipulative mom (another Emmy nomination). Some of those episodes were directed by Steven Robman, whom she married in June of 2003. Kathy has two sons from a previous marriage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MTA4NTExNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU0MDgzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000834","name":"Kathy Baker","idIMDB":"nm0000834"},"actorId":"nm0000834","character":"Sally Swanger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009339","main":true},{"actorName":"James Gammon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304000","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MzIxNDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA3NDYyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 April 1940","placeOfBirth":" Newman, Illinois, USA","birthName":"James Richard Gammon","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Rugged-looking James Gammon first broke into the entertainment industry not as an actor but as a TV cameraman.

Not the kind of guy you'd see in a tuxedo in a Noël Coward drawing-room comedy--unless he was one of a gang holding them up--Gammon could play lighter parts also, as evidenced by his work as the manager in the baseball comedy Major League (1989) and in his regular role as Don Johnson's rambunctious father in Johnson's Nash Bridges (1996) series.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MzIxNDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA3NDYyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304000","name":"James Gammon","idIMDB":"nm0304000"},"actorId":"nm0304000","character":"Esco Swanger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009341","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlie Hunnam","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402271","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5NjE5Mzk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI5MDE1Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 April 1980","placeOfBirth":" Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, England, UK","birthName":"Charles Matthew Hunnam","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Charles Matthew Hunnam was born in Newcastle, England on April 10, 1980, to Jane (Bell), a business owner, and William Hunnam, a scrap metal merchant.

He gained fame in Britain thanks to his television role as the love-smitten Nathan Maloney in Queer as Folk (1999). Independent movies, television series and auditions for such blockbusters as Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) followed, but it wasn't until 2002 that Charlie started to attract international attention, when he supported Katie Holmes in the suspense thriller Abandon (2002). His first lead role in a film was in Nicholas Nickleby (2002). After which, he played a pivotal character in the strongly cast, adapted drama Cold Mountain (2003). This was Charlie's first part that he has named in his \"trilogy of mad men.\" The two that followed were in Green Street Hooligans and Children of Men.

His diverse and eclectic resume ranges from hilarious roles in such comedies as Mallrats (1995) and Without a Paddle (2004) to hauntingly dramatic performances in intense features such as American History X (1998), Blow (2001) and Cold Mountain (2003). His breakthrough performance as a young football player in Disney's Remember the Titans (2000) with Denzel Washington garnered him critical acclaim and led to another role opposite Washington in director Nick Cassavetes' thriller, John Q (2002). Born in New York and raised in Los Angeles, Suplee is the son of actors Debbie and Bill Suplee. He landed his first role at the age of 16 on the popular television series Boy Meets World (1993). He had a recurring role as the reluctant bully \"Frankie\" for three seasons. Most recently for television, he made a powerful guest-starring appearance on NBC's Third Watch (1999) as a disturbed young man who filmed a video journal about his obsession with a girl. He made his feature film debut in 1995 (alongside My Name Is Earl (2005) co-star Jason Lee) in writer/director Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995). where he played the memorable 'Willam Black,' a young man determined to crack the mystery behind the mall's magic eye poster. Smith went on to cast Suplee in Chasing Amy (1997) and as the voice of 'Norman the Golgothan' in _Dogma (1998)_. More recent comedy credits include \"Without A Paddle\" with Seth Green and Matthew Lillard, director Todd Phillips Road Trip (2000) and Evolution (2001) for director Ivan Reitman. Suplee showcased his impressive acting chops with a powerful and compelling performance in 1998 in director Tony Kaye's \"American History X.\" He played a carelessly violent racist skinhead who tries to convince his friend (Edward Norton) to \"come back to his roots\" in their gang of white supremacists. His role of high school football lineman \"Louie\" in Disney's \"Remember the Titans\" exposed Suplee to a larger audience, and he was singled out by many critics as a fresh and welcome screen presence, with the Hollywood Reporter calling his performance \"scene-stealing.\" With Ted Demme's 1970s drug-cartel drama \"Blow,\" Suplee continued to raise his profile, playing \"Tuna\", the best friend of Johnny Depp's newly turned drug dealer \"George Jung\". More recently, Suplee played a pivotal role of a young soldier in Miramax and Anthony Minghella's period piece \"Cold Mountain,\" with Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. He also co-starred with Ashton Kutcher in New Line's The Butterfly Effect (2004).
