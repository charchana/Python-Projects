This is indeed a pity because Jonathan Firth has developed a distinct and interesting resume of his own with performances in radio, theatre, feature films, but more prominently in very high quality television work.After graduating from the Central School of Speech and Drama, London (1989), Firth landed several television roles, most notably as the \"struggling to find himself\" Fred Vincy in the wonderful British mini-series Middlemarch (1994). Firth later had an opportunity to showcase a fuller range of emotion and acting skill as the very complicated Sergeant Troy in a superior remake of Far from the Madding Crowd (1998). More recently, Mr. Firth was cast as the morally upright Prince Albert in A & E's production of Victoria & Albert (2001). His latest credits include \"Luther\" (2003), a memorable guest appearance on \"Ghost Whisperer\" (2006) as well as playing Soren in the \"The Prince and Me\" sequels (2006 - 2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMjM3MDIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg4MjI5NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278746","name":"Jonathan Firth","idIMDB":"nm0278746"},"actorId":"nm0278746","character":"Sergeant Frank Troy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0147870","main":true},{"actorName":"Nigel Terry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0856050","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMjAwODg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEyNjAyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 August 1945","placeOfBirth":" Bristol, England, UK","birthName":"Peter Nigel Terry","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"British actor Nigel Terry primarily dedicated himself to the classical stage. When he extended himself into film and TV outings, it was mostly for historical or period roles. Over the years, he grew quite comfortable in both a pair of hose and a suit of armor. Terry was born Peter Nigel Terry on August 15, 1945, in Bristol, England, to Doreen Beatrice (Such) and Frank Albert Terry, an RAF pilot. He trained with several repertory companies, including the Oxford Meadow Players and Bristol Old Vic, where some of his better-known works included \"Volpone\", \"Right You Are\", \"The Balcony\", \"Richard II\" and \"Two Gentlemen from Verona\". Over time, he appeared extensively with the Royal Shakespearean Company, the Round House Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre. Showing flashes of brilliance in his film debut as the drooling, moronic and cowardly \"Prince John\" in The Lion in Winter (1968), Nigel held his own opposite a most intimidating cast that included Peter O'Toole, Oscar-winner Katharine Hepburn and Anthony Hopkins (who also made his film debut). Surprisingly, it did not lead to a torrent of film roles. In demand on the repertory stage, however, he continued with sterling roles in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"'Tis Pity She's a Whore\", \"Queen Christina\", \"Look Out...Here Comes Trouble\", \"The Suicide\" and \"A Month in the Country\". Thirteen years later, Nigel finally returned to the cinema, making a memorable comeback in John Boorman's medieval epic Excalibur (1981) as \"King Arthur\", who grew from a humbling, bumbling squire to a noble and rather melancholy ruler throughout the course of the film. This feat, in turn, ignited more on-camera work. Nigel earned kudos playing the title role in Derek Jarman's Caravaggio (1986) and, subsequently, turned in other interestingly off-kilter characters for Jarman in The Last of England (1987), War Requiem (1989), Edward II (1991) and Blue (1993), an association that ended with Jarman's AIDS-related death in 1994. Nigel also became a familiar face on British TV. He was probably best-known in America for starring in the US/British series Covington Cross (1992), in which he played \"Sir Thomas Gray\", a medieval knight. In addition, he created fascinating character portraits in the plush TV costumers The Mushroom Picker (1993), Far from the Madding Crowd (1998) and Crime and Punishment (2002). In the 2000s, Nigel also appeared in the films The Emperor's New Clothes (2001), Feardotcom (2002) and the Brad Pitt epic Troy (2004). Nigel Terry died on 30 April, 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMjAwODg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEyNjAyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0856050","name":"Nigel Terry","idIMDB":"nm0856050"},"actorId":"nm0856050","character":"Mr. Boldwood","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0147869","main":true},{"actorName":"Gwynn Beech","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066288","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Gwynn Beech is an actor, known for Far from the Madding Crowd (1998), Shearing (2002) and Brookside: Friday the 13th (1998).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066288","name":"Gwynn Beech","idIMDB":"nm0066288"},"actorId":"nm0066288","character":"Simeon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Susan McArdle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564096","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NTg0NjEwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU4ODI0MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' (1.52 m)","bio":"Susan McArdle was born in Manchester, England.

On leaving school, Linda went to work at the Old Vic as an usherette and catering manager, before going to read English at Leeds University. However, she dropped out after a year and became involved in a local drama group which put on plays in community-based locations, such as schools. She regards this as her theatrical schooling, having had no formal training. She made her London stage debut at the age of thirty-two in 1982 and, in 1991, she joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. Although she was a well-regarded stage performer, it was the 1999 film version of the play East Is East (1999) (in which she had been an original stage cast member) which brought her to a larger audience and, throughout the 2000s, she has been a familiar face in a variety of films and television series.

The son of Sir Peter Parker and Dr. Jill Parker, he decided at the age of nine that acting would be his career of choice. His first public performances were with the National Youth Theatre, a breeding ground for many British actors. After attending The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA), Nathaniel became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). Before exiting the stage for the screen, Nathaniel portrayed \"Bassanio\" in The Merchant Of Venice, participating in both the London and Broadway productions. The production was directed by the critically acclaimed Sir Peter Hall and starred Dustin Hoffman. His first feature film, War Requiem (1989), was directed by the highly acclaimed British maverick Derek Jarman, and starred Tilda Swinton and Lord Laurence Olivier. Nathaniel is perhaps best known for his participation in period dramas such as the part of \"Laertes\" in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990), \"Rochester\" in Wide Sargasso Sea (1993) and \"Cassio\" in his brother Oliver Parker's version of Othello (1995), starring Laurence Fishburne. He also appeared in the Chris Farley comedy Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) and the Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston box office hit, The Bodyguard (1992). Parts in projects such as Into Thin Air: Death on Everest (1997) and David (1997) helped Nathaniel gain momentum in the world of television, but it was roles like \"Rawdon Crawley\" in Vanity Fair (1998) and \"Gabriel Oak\" in Far from the Madding Crowd (1998) that thrust him into the spotlight and solidified his career on the small screen. Currently, Nathaniel portrays \"Detective Thomas Lynley\" in the BBC series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries (2001). Now in its third season, the show has become an international success, earning rave reviews the world over. Returning to Hollywood in 2003, Nathaniel can be seen in cinemas soon, portraying \"Master Edward Gracey\" in Walt Disney Pictures The Haunted Mansion (2003), starring Eddie Murphy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ODMyMDEyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkwMTcyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662511","name":"Nathaniel Parker","nicknames":["Nat"],"idIMDB":"nm0662511"},"actorId":"nm0662511","character":"Gabriel Oak","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0147868","main":true},{"actorName":"Phillip Joseph","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430676","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Phillip Joseph is known for his work on The Keep (1983), Far from the Madding Crowd (1998) and The Terence Davies Trilogy (1983).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430676","name":"Phillip Joseph","idIMDB":"nm0430676"},"actorId":"nm0430676","character":"Jan Coggan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0147875","main":true},{"actorName":"Robin Soans","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811629","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA3NjM4NjEyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ0MzY5OTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1947","placeOfBirth":" Northamptonshire, England, UK","bio":"Robin Soans was born in 1947 in Northamptonshire, England.
