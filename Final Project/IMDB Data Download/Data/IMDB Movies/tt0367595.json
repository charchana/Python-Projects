Her dad was the popular Tamil actor, Gemini, while her mom was a popular Telugu actress, Pushpavalli. She has seven sisters and one brother. One of her sisters is Dr. Kamala Selvaraj, while another one, Radha, lives in San Francisco with a son named Naveed, who is being readied to act in Bollywood movies. No stranger to the tinsel screen, Bhanurekha acted in a Telugu movie 'Rangula Ratnam' as Baby Bhanurekha along with her mom during 1966, which was subsequently re-made and released in Hindi during 1976 as Rangila Ratan (1976). She acted in one more Telugu as well as one Kannada movie (Amma Kosam and Goadalli CID 999 respectively) before re-locating to Bombay. Due to her background, she ended up being very gloomy and pessimistic during her early years. She get a chance to debut in Bollywood movies during 1970 with Sawan Bhadon (1970) opposite Navin Nischol with a screen name of Rekha. Inability to speak Hindi, a dusky complexion as well as her weight did not exactly add to her assets in a predominantly fair-skinned, Hindi-speaking North-Indian film industry. She decided to take matters seriously, took Yoga, shed those extra pounds, learned Hindi and dancing, and thus was born a new and much improved Rekha - who went on to deliver one box office hit after another for example Nagin (1976), Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978), Mr. Natwarlal (1979), Khubsoorat (1980), Umrao Jaan (1981), Khoon Bhari Maang (1988) amongst others. In her later years she has taken up character roles and appeared as a mother, even a grandmother in Krrish (2006) during 2006. Her slim, slender looks got her many admirers, including well established Bollywood actors such as Kiran Kumar, Jeetendra, Vinod Mehra, and Amitabh Bachchan. Her marriage to Vinod ended in a divorce, and she ended up getting married to a businessman, Mukesh Aggarwal. This marriage also resulted in a divorce, with Mukesh killing himself shortly thereafter. She likes to surf the Internet, has written biographies of actresses like Zeenat Aman, and Salma Agha on IMDb, likes to collect old photographs and postcards, mimic people, watch movies, and practices Yoga regularly, read comics like Archie and Dennie the Menace, and is a vegetarian.

She has three brothers and three sisters. Two of her brothers are Jatin and Lalit - Bollywood music composers, while one of her sisters' is Vijayata Pandit, an actress/singer in her own right. Vijayata is the wife of Composer, Aadesh Srivastav. Things were anything but easy for Sulakshana, the eldest of all the siblings, especially when her father left, making her the bread-winner for the entire family. She began her career in Bollywood as a playback singer in 1967. Since then she has acted in over 20 & sung in over 21 movies, in a career that spanned from 1967 through to 1988. Some of her more popular songs are 'Bekare Dil Tu Gaaye Ja, Khushiyon Se Bhare Woh Tarane' (Door Ka Rahi); 'Bandhi Re Kahey Preet, Piya Ke Sang, Anjaane Mein (Sankoch); \"Mausam Mausam Lovely Mausam, Kasak Anjaani, Madhyam Madhyam' (Thodisi Bewafai); and the award-winning 'Tu Hi Sagar Hai Tu Hi Kinara, Dundta Hai Tu Kiska Sahara' from the 1975 flick 'Sankalp'. She met with and fell in love with Harihar Zariwala, more popularly known as Bollywood actor Sanjeev Kumar, who was so very smitten by actress Hema Malini, that he turned her down. Heartbroken, She never married. She fell into hard times after she stopped getting any offers, especially when she insisted on singing and acting simultaneously. She ended up living in a dilapidated flat that was unfurnished, and badly in need of repairs, so much so that she could not find a buyer for it. In 2005 things changed for the better, when actor Jeetendra convinced his brother-in-law to buy this flat, while Vijeta and Aadesh stepped in to assist Sulakshana get back to her feet. With the sale of her flat, she was able to pay off her debts, as well as invest the left-over funds in 3 other flats - which ultimately continue to provide for her needs.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0659264","name":"Sulakshana Pandit","nicknames":["Sulu"],"idIMDB":"nm0659264"},"actorId":"nm0659264","character":"Diana","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Amol Palekar","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0657505","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzZhNDQ1YzItNTVlOC00MmVmLTkzMjEtMDFmN2Q0MDU2YmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 November 1944","placeOfBirth":" Bombay, Bombay Presidency, British India","bio":"Amol Palekar was born on November 24, 1944 in Bombay, Bombay Presidency, British India.
