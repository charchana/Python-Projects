That was followed by roles in Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970), The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971) and another Roth adaptation, Portnoy's Complaint (1972), that turned him into a prominent \"archetype of East Coast Jewish intellectual agony\", as critic Jonathan Romney defines him. But his forte was comedy and he won a Golden Globe when he repeated his stage role in the film version of Neil Simon's The Sunshine Boys (1975).

Murray Abraham was born on October 24, 1939 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and raised in El Paso, Texas. Primarily a stage actor, Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in the George C. Scott comedy They Might Be Giants (1971). By the mid-1970s, Murray had steady employment as an actor, doing commercials and voice-over work. He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet's Serpico (1973), and in television roles including the villain in one third-season episode of Kojak (1973). His film work of those years also included the roles of a cabdriver in The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1975), a mechanic in The Sunshine Boys (1975), and a police officer in All the President's Men (1976). Beyond these small roles, Abraham continued to do commercials and voice-over work for income. But in 1978, he decided to give them up. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, Abraham said, \"No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had\". His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a \"house husband\". He described, \"I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me\". Abraham appeared as drug dealer Omar Suárez alongside Pacino again in the gangster film Scarface (1983). He also gained visibility voicing a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear. In 1985 he was honored with as Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for the acclaimed role of envious composer Antonio Salieri in Amadeus (1984), an award for which Tom Hulce, playing Mozart in that movie, had also been nominated. He was also honored with a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama, among other awards, and his role in the film, is still considered to be his most iconic as the film's director Milos Forman inspired the work of the role with Abraham's wide range of qualities as a great stage and film actor. After Amadeus, he next appeared in The Name of the Rose (1986), in which he played Bernardo Gui, nemesis to Sean Connery's William of Baskerville. In the DVD audio commentary, his director on the film, Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an \"egomaniac\" on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery, since Connery did not have an Oscar. That said, the film was a critical success. Abraham had tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy, as he also explained to People Weekly magazine in an interview he gave at the time of its release.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ2MzQ2ODYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY3NTIxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000719","name":"F.

He was a member of the improv group, \"the Committee\", for ten years in the sixties and seventies. He has been a character actor for many years on different television shows since the 1960s, and took small parts in The Andy Griffith Show (1960), Dragnet 1967 (1967), Soap (1977) and Sanford and Son (1972). The role that brought him to prominence was Howard Johnson in the cult classic Billy Jack (1971). He has been active in movies and TV since. He was a frequent guest star on The Bob Newhart Show (1972), but the best was yet to come. He will perhaps be forever remembered on the classic series WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), as anti-disco DJ Dr. Johnny Fever. Also in the seventies, Hesseman appeared in a small part in The Sunshine Boys (1975), Tunnel Vision (1976), Silent Movie (1976) and The Big Bus (1976). After the cancellation of WKRP in Cincinnati (1978), he went on to star as the husband of Ann Romano in One Day at a Time (1975). After that series was cancelled, Hesseman starred in more cult classics, such as This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Doctor Detroit (1983), Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment (1985), (a role which he refused to play again) Clue (1985) and Flight of the Navigator (1986). He then got another part in television, this time as a teacher in the high school sitcom Head of the Class (1986). As Mr. Moore, he was insightful, funny and a pleasure to watch. Hesseman left the show in 1990 and has done a steady stream of television guest roles since. In 1987, he was in the star-studded Amazon Women on the Moon (1987), and, in 1991, he starred in the very strange film Rubin and Ed (1991). Since then, he has been in a handful of other films, including Gridlock'd (1997) with Tupac Shakur. His work in recent years concentrates mostly on television, where he takes mostly small guest roles, in shows like That '70s Show (1998), Touched by an Angel (1994), The Practice (1997) and Crossing Jordan (2001). Since his career began, Hesseman has gained a reputation as a quality and versatile character actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTkzNDg5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTk1MTY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0381606","name":"Howard Hesseman","idIMDB":"nm0381606"},"actorId":"nm0381606","character":"Mr. Walsh, Commerical Director","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Cranna","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186488","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Cranna is known for his work on Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), American Graffiti (1973) and The Sunshine Boys (1975).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186488","name":"James Cranna","idIMDB":"nm0186488"},"actorId":"nm0186488","character":"Mr. Schaeffer, TV Director","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ron Rifkin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0726492","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNjY4MzkyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg3MDA3MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 October 1939","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Saul M.
