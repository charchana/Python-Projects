He moved around a lot after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no abuse, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He had no acting experience in college and, in fact, credits the fact that he couldn't get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. He met his second wife, actress Rita Wilson on the set of his television show Bosom Buddies (1980) - she appeared in one episode in the second season (1981), Bosom Buddies: All You Need Is Love (1981).

His mother, a community-service worker, remarried her high-school sweetheart, an Episcopalian deacon, two years after Tim's father's death. Tim has a total of eight siblings. His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scottish. When Tim was young, his family moved to Birmingham, Michigan. In high school, his favorite subject was shop, of course, and after high school, he attended Western Michigan University and graduated with a degree in Television Production in 1975. In 1978, he was arrested on drug charges and spent two years in jail. Upon his release, he had a new outlook on life and on a dare from a friend, started his comedy career at the Comedy Castle in Detroit. Later, he went on to do several cable specials, including, Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen (1988) and Tim Allen: Men Are Pigs (1990). In 1991, he became the star of his own hit television series on ABC called Home Improvement (1991). While continuing to film his television series throughout most of the 1990s, he starred in a string of blockbuster movies including The Santa Clause (1994), Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999) and Galaxy Quest (1999).

A famous and successful football star at San Diego State, he played with the Oakland Raiders and retired from the sport in 1974, in order to give full attention to his goal: to be a real actor. Weathers first played small parts in two blaxploitation flicks, Friday Foster (1975) (in which he played \"Yarbro\") and Bucktown (1975) (playing \"Hambone\"), both made in 1975 and directed by Arthur Marks. However, his big break came the following year when producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff chose him to play \"Apollo Creed\" in the blockbuster \"sleeper\" Rocky (1976) (real-life boxing legend Ken Norton was originally signed for the part, but it eventually went to Weathers). He went on to play \"Creed\" in three other \"Rocky\" movies, and the characters' adversarial relationship eventually evolved into a warm friendship. After Creed's death in Rocky IV (1985), Weathers met with producer Joel Silver and agreed to play an important supporting role in Predator (1987), an action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year, Silver produced Action Jackson (1988), a first starring role for Weathers, but it performed poorly at the box office and was panned by the critics. During the 1990s, Weathers starred in four In the Heat of the Night (1988) two-hour TV specials that were much better received by critics and viewers alike. In 1996, he played the part of \"Chubbs Peterson\" in the blockbuster Adam Sandler comedy Happy Gilmore (1996). He returned to his \"action roots\" in two TV-movies with Hulk Hogan: Assault on Devil's Island (1997) and Assault on Death Mountain (1999). In addition to his acting career, Weathers is also a member of the Big Brothers Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee, handling the career of athletes of various sports such as gymnastics, wrestling, swimming and judo.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDVhMzc5N2EtZTQ3ZS00NmJlLWE2MTctOGZmMDgzMjM1YzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2NDk0NTc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001835","name":"Carl Weathers","idIMDB":"nm0001835"},"actorId":"nm0001835","character":"Combat Carl / Combat Carl Jr.","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0386917","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephen Tobolowsky","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0864997","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyMTU5NzcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYxNDk3Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 May 1951","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","birthName":"Stephen Harold Tobolowsky","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Character actor Stephen Tobolowsky was born on May 30, 1951 in Dallas, Texas. Over the past three decades, Tobolowsky has racked up a lengthy list of roles in movies and television across many different genres. While Tobolowsky initially attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas with the intention of studying geology, he was quickly drawn in to acting there. He later attended the University of Illinois for one year. Tobolowsky worked primarily in theater during his early career, and wrote and directed a few plays including \"Two Idiots in Hollywood\" and \"True Stories\". His film career took off in the 1980s, though, thanks to roles in The Philadelphia Experiment (1984), Nobody's Fool (1986), Spaceballs (1987), and Mississippi Burning (1988). Since then, Tobolowsky has appeared in many popular movies including Bird on a Wire (1990), Basic Instinct (1992), Groundhog Day (1993), Radioland Murders (1994), Murder in the First (1995), Mr. Magoo (1997), The Insider (1999), Memento (2000), Freaky Friday (2003), Garfield (2004) and Wild Hogs (2007).

He has been comparison-shopped roundly for stepping into roles played by other actors, first following Sir Laurence Olivier in Wuthering Heights (1970), then as \"James Bond\" in The Living Daylights (1987) and Licence to Kill (1989), and even more brutally, recently, as \"Rhett Butler\" in Scarlett (1994). Undaunted and good-natured, he has always stated that he likes the risk of challenges. He was born in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, the oldest of five children of Dorothy (Scholes) and Peter Dalton-Leggett. His father was stationed in Colwyn Bay during WWII, and moved the family to Manchester in the late 1940s, where he worked in advertising and raised the growing Dalton family, in an upper-class neighbourhood outside of Belper, Derbyshire. Timothy was enrolled in a school for bright children, where he excelled in sports and was interested in the sciences. He was fascinated with acting from a young age, perhaps due to the fact that both his grandfathers were vaudevillians, but it was when he saw a performance of \"Macbeth\" at age 16 that his destiny was clinched. After leaving Herbert Strutt Grammar School at the age of sixteen, he toured as a leading member of Michael Croft's National Youth Theater. Between 1964-66, he studied at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Just before completing his two years, he quit and joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, playing the lead in many productions under the direction of Peter Dews while at the same time turning professional. Dalton later said of RADA in an interview with \"Seventeen\" Magazine (December 1970), \"It took a year to undo the psychological damage that was caused by the oppressive teachers\". His talent and classic good looks immediately landed him professional work in television, guest-starring on an episode of the short-lived TV series, Judge Dee (1969), and as a regular on the 14-episode series Sat'day While Sunday (1967) with the young Malcolm McDowell. In late 1967 Peter O'Toole recommended him for the role of the young \"King Philip of France\" in The Lion in Winter (1968) (coincidentally, this was also Anthony Hopkins' big break). The following year, he starred in the Italian film Le voyeur (1970) with Marcello Mastroianni and Virna Lisi, although his voice was dubbed into Italian by another actor. Dalton also mixed in a healthy dose of BBC work during this time, including The Three Princes (1968), _BBC Play of the Month: Five Finger Exercise (1970) (TV)_and Candida (1973). Also during this time, he was approached and tested for the role of James Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) but turned it down, feeling he was too young for the part. His next film was another costume drama, Cromwell (1970), working with director Ken Hughes, with whom he later made his first American film, Sextette (1978). He followed Cromwell (1970) with Wuthering Heights (1970) and Mary, Queen of Scots (1971). He was already developing a pattern in his films that would follow him throughout his career: costume dramas where he played royalty, which he had done in three of his first four films (and ridden horses in three, and raised a sword in two). In 1972, he was contracted to play a part in Lady Caroline Lamb (1972). However, at the last moment he was replaced. Dalton sued the company and won, but the film went on without him. From the early to mid-1970s, he decided to further hone his skills by going back into the theater full time. He signed on with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) and the Prospect Theatre Company (PTC), and toured the world with both, playing the leads in \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"King Lear\", \"Henry V\", \"Love's Labours Lost\", and \"Henry IV\" - parts 1 and 2. In 1975, he returned to movies in the British/Austrian production of The Executioner (1975). It was followed in 1976 by the Spanish religious historical film about the inquisition, The Man Who Knew Love (1978), which was never widely released. After this, he took another break from film, mixing in a healthy dose of theater, returning for his first American film, Sextette (1978), and the lengthy miniseries Centennial (1978), his first American television appearance, in which Lynn Redgrave played his wife. Because of his broad exposure to American audiences in this series, he began to get more frequent film and television work in the US, including the episode \"Fallen Angel\" of Charlie's Angels (1976) -- which, ironically, had several references to his character being like \"James Bond\" -- and the TV movie The Flame Is Love (1979). Although he did a few features, including playing Vanessa Redgrave's husband in Agatha (1979), most of his work until 1985 consisted of TV movies and miniseries. He played royalty again in the very campy Flash Gordon (1980). He followed this with a small film, Chanel Solitaire (1981) and, in 1981, also filmed a staged production of Antony and Cleopatra (1984) opposite Lynn Redgrave, with Anthony Geary, as well as Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig of the original TV series, Star Trek (1966). The years 1983-1987 have so far been the most prolific of his career. In 1983, he starred as \"Rochester\" in what he considers one of his best works, the BBC's very popular Jane Eyre (1983). Also, during this time, Roger Moore was considering leaving Bond, and Dalton was again approached, but due to his full schedule, he had to decline. In 1984, he did one of his many narrations in the Faerie Tale Theatre (1982) production of The Emperor's New Clothes (1987). That same year also saw him in the Hallmark Hall of Fame piece The Master of Ballantrae (1984) opposite Michael York and Richard Thomas, and another miniseries, Mistral's Daughter (1984), opposite Stefanie Powers and Stacy Keach. The next year was also a very busy one. He starred in another miniseries, Sins (1986), playing the brother of Joan Collins, and also starred in and narrated the four-hour TV movie Florence Nightingale (1985), opposite Jaclyn Smith. He also starred in The Doctor and the Devils (1985) as \"Dr. Thomas Rock\", with Stephen Rea, Jonathan Pryce, and Patrick Stewart. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Dalton narrated many nature documentaries, most notably several episodes of the UK series Wildlife Chronicles (1987) (called \"Wildlife Chronicles\" in the US). In the spring of 1986, he teamed with Vanessa Redgrave for another revival of a Shakespeare production, The Taming of the Shrew (1988) and his interpretation of \"Petrucchio\" received uniformly high praise. Simultaneously, the world was playing a guessing game as to who would succeed Roger Moore as \"James Bond\". Dalton was approached but was committed to the theater, and so Pierce Brosnan was offered the part. When Brosnan was unable to get out of his Remington Steele (1982) contract at the last minute, Dalton was again approached. Able now to work it into his tight schedule, he agreed. Although his first outing as Bond, The Living Daylights (1987), did reasonably well at the box-office, Licence to Kill (1989) suffered from a lack of marketing that appeared to harm its chances of big box-office success. However, Dalton's interpretation of \"Bond\" in this film received critical acclaim in some quarters as being the closest to author Ian Fleming's literary \"Bond\". Back in the theater, he teamed again with Vanessa Redgrave for a revival of Eugene O'Neill's seldom performed play, \"A Touch of the Poet\", which is considered by some to be his and Redgrave's finest professional collaboration. Although there were talks of bringing the play to Broadway, this never materialized. Following Licence to Kill (1989), he immediately returned to one of his strengths, costume drama, in The King's Whore (1990). It was followed by his excellent performance in Disney's The Rocketeer (1991), where he played a swashbuckling, Errol Flynn type. In August 1991, he teamed with Whoopi Goldberg for the first bi-racial interpretation of \"Love Letters\" for the final sold-out performances of the play in Los Angeles. When he had signed on to do \"Bond\" it was for three pictures, but the rights to the \"Bond\" films became entangled in lengthy litigation, delaying production of the third. During this wait, he was set to star in the title role of another historical epic, Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992). From the start, however, the film was doomed due to the competition with the Gérard Depardieu \"Columbus\" picture, which was racked with its own problems. When the director was replaced, Dalton backed out and was followed by his co-star, Isabella Rossellini. In 1992, he starred in the A&E production Framed (1992), which won a bronze medal in the 1993 New York Film Festival. The next year, he journeyed to northern Alaska and Minnesota to make a documentary on one of his favorite subjects, wolves. In the Company of Whales (1991) went on to win a silver medal in the 1994 New York Film Festival. He kept busy in television through 1993 and 1994. He made Red Eagle (1994), Scarlett (1994) and managed to squeeze in a guest appearance on Tales from the Crypt (1989) in the episode \"Werewolf Concerto\". In 1994, he took on the role of \"Rhett Butler\" in the eight-hour mini-series Scarlett (1994), produced by Robert Halmi Sr. for the Hallmark Hall of Fame. In April of that year, believing he needed to move on to fresh challenges, he officially resigned the role of \"James Bond\", a move which was much regretted by the producers, though they understood his reasons. After two months of negotiations, the role went to Pierce Brosnan. In September 1994, Dalton was called upon for two readings of \"Peter and the Wolf\" at the Hollywood Bowl. He played to full-capacity crowds. In November, Scarlett (1994) premiered and, though given only a lukewarm response by critics, it was a ratings success not only in the US but all over the world, breaking records in many European countries. As always after a major work, Dalton again withdrew quietly and without fanfare to search for his next project, a small, personal film. In the summer of 1995, he journeyed to Canada to shoot Salt Water Moose (1996). The film was made by Canada's Norstar Entertainment and was sold to Halmi to be the first video release in his new line of Hallmark family films. It premiered on Showtime in June 1996. During the spring of 1996, he made the IRA drama The Informant (1997) in Ireland and, in May, he traveled to Prague to shoot Passion's Way (1999), opposite Sela Ward. On February 7, 1997, the comedy The Beautician and the Beast (1997) co-starring Fran Drescher opened in the US. He also gleefully parodied his swashbuckling/James Bond image in Les Looney Tunes passent à l'action (2003) as a spy playing an actor playing a spy. In 1995, Dalton began a relationship with Oksana Grigorieva which produced a child in 1997, Dalton's son Alexander. Over the following years, Dalton has been a caring and loving father of his son. Very much a private man, Dalton's pastimes include fishing, reading, jazz, opera, antique fairs and auctions and, of course, movies.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE5NDA1OTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE3NDk0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001096","name":"Timothy Dalton","nicknames":["Tim","The Daltonator","T-Dalt"],"idIMDB":"nm0001096"},"actorId":"nm0001096","character":"Mr. Pricklepants","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0160340","main":true},{"actorName":"Wallace Shawn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001728","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MDYzMDQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3OTc1MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 November 1943","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Wallace Michael Shawn","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"American character actor and writer Wallace Shawn has one of those fun, mischievously homely faces just made to entertain. Though he got out of the starting gate rather slowly, he has since excelled on stage, television and film while managing to turn himself into a winner with his loser-type looks. Woody Allen's character in the movie Manhattan (1979) amusingly describes Wallace's character as \"a homunculus\", which is a pretty fair description of this predominantly bald, wan, pucker-mouthed, butterball-framed, slightly lisping gent. Wallace made his movie debut in Allen's heralded classic playing Diane Keaton's ex-husband. Born to privilege on November 12, 1943 in New York City, Wallace was the son of renowned editor William Shawn of \"The New Yorker\" fame and educated at both Harvard University, where he studied history, and Magdalen College, Oxford. Wallace initially taught English in India on a Fulbright scholarship, and then English, Latin and drama back in New York. However, a keen interest in writing and acting soon compelled him to leave his cushy position and pursue a stage career as both playwright and actor. During his distinguished career, Wallace turned out several plays. \"Our Late Night\", the first of his works to be performed, was awarded an off-Broadway Obie in 1975. \"A Thought in Three Parts\" (1976); \"The Mandrake\" (1977), which he translated from the original Italian and in which he made his acting debut; \"Marie and Bruce\" (1979); \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\" (1985) and \"The Fever\", for which he received his second Obie Award for \"Best New Play\" during the 1990-91 season, then followed. A popular support player in both comedy and occasional drama, his assorted kooks, creeps, eggheads and schmucks possessed both endearing and unappetizing qualities. He earned some of his best early notices partnered with theatre director/actor Andre Gregory in the unique Louis Malle-directed film My Dinner with Andre (1981). Shawn co-wrote the improvisatory, humanistic piece and his brother, Allen Shawn, was the composer. Shawn and Gregory would collaborate again for Malle in another superb, original-concept film Vanya on 42nd Street (1994). Among the quality offbeat filming involving has been Bruce Paltrow's A Little Sex (1982); James Ivory's The Bostonians (1984); Stephen Frears' Prick Up Your Ears (1987); Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride (1987); Alan Rudolph's The Moderns (1988) and Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994); Paul Bartel's Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989); and several others for Woody Allen: Radio Days (1987), Shadows and Fog (1991), The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001) and Melinda and Melinda (2004).
