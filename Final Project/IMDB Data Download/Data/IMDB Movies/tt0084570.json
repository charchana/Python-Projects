His parents are Mercedes Hall, an actress-blues and jazz singer, and Larry Hall, who owned an auto body shop. His stepfather is a show-business manager. His sister, Mary Christian, is also a performer. He has Irish and Italian ancestry. Hall's given name was Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall, but he adopted the Anthony Michael moniker upon finding that another Michael Hall was already a member of the Screen Actors' Guild. Hall began acting in commercials at the age of seven, and his breakthrough role was as Rusty Griswold in National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) alongside Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Following the success of National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Hall entered the defining period of his career, starring in three John Hughes classics: Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985) and Weird Science (1985). Wanting to avoid being typecast, Hall turned down roles in two subsequent 1986 Hughes films, Pretty in Pink (1986) and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). His early television credits include the Emmy Award-winning \"The Gold Bug\", in which he played the young Edgar Allan Poe, as well as the TV movie Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (1982), and specials \"The Body Human\" and \"Orphans, Waifs and Wards\". On stage, he appeared in the Lincoln Center Festival's production of \"St. Joan of the Microphone\". Following a one-year stint on Saturday Night Live (1975), excessive drinking and partying threatened to sidetrack Hall's career. However, he was able to regain control and has been sober since 1990, the year he played the role of Jim in Edward Scissorhands (1990). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, he starred as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in the television movie Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999). Since that time, Hall has focused on television work, including an 81-episode run on Stephen King's The Dead Zone (2002), but has managed to take on film projects as well, including the role of Mike Engel in The Dark Knight (2008). In addition to acting, Hall has also pursued his musical talents, as songwriter and lead singer of his band, Hall of Mirrors, which was formed in 1998. Hall helps at-risk youth via the Anthony Michael Hall Literacy Club and lives in Los Angeles, Caifornia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MjM2MjAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2NjQwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309","name":"Anthony Michael Hall","idIMDB":"nm0001309"},"actorId":"nm0001309","character":"Huck Finn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0256820","main":true},{"actorName":"Anthony James","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416279","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 July 1942","placeOfBirth":" Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, USA","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Character actor Anthony James was born on July 22nd, 1942 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Tall and lanky, with a rough, pockmarked face, a lean, stringy build, greasy dark hair and an extremely edgy'n'intense screen presence, James was often cast in Westerns as really scary, sleazy and disgusting villains. James was especially memorable as the hateful racist diner counterman in the outstanding In the Heat of the Night (1967). Other noteworthy parts include a slimy gay hitchhiker in the cult classic Vanishing Point (1971), a wimpy priest in The Culpepper Cattle Co. (1972), a scuzzy outlaw in High Plains Drifter (1973), a deranged psycho in The Teacher (1974), a creepy chauffeur in the spooky haunted house horror chiller Burnt Offerings (1976), and the vicious leader of a gang of ferocious barbarians in the strictly so-so science fiction outing Ravagers (1979). James was hilarious in a rare change-of-pace good guy role as a heroic cannibal (!) in the amusing tongue-in-cheek post-nuke sci-fi romp World Gone Wild (1987). He was likewise funny parodying his evil persona in The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear (1991). Among the many TV shows James did guest spots on are Married with Children (1987), Beauty and the Beast (1987), Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), Simon & Simon (1981), The A-Team (1983), Riptide (1984), The Fall Guy (1981), Hunter (1984), Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979), Quincy M.E.

His last film appearance to date was as the mean owner of a seedy bordello in Clint Eastwood's acclaimed Western Unforgiven (1992). After voluntarily quitting acting in the early 90s, Anthony James has since pursued a successful career as an artist. His paintings have been exhibited in galleries in such major cities as New York, Boston and Miami.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416279","name":"Anthony James","idIMDB":"nm0416279"},"actorId":"nm0416279","character":"Scree","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Allyn Ann McLerie","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572885","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUxMzA1Mzg1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE1NDYxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 December 1926","placeOfBirth":" Grand-Mère, Québec, Canada","bio":"Talented actress, dancer and singer with a long history on Broadway, and in Hollywood, and television, Ms. McLerie apparently decided to retire in 1993.

Zerbe was born May 20, 1936 in Long Beach, and served a stint in the United States Air Force before heading off to New York to study drama under noted acting coach Stella Adler. He made his screen debut as Dutchie, one of Charlton Heston's fellow cowhands in the western Will Penny (1967), played a miner in The Molly Maguires (1970), was a post-apocalyptic, lunatic messiah in The Omega Man (1971), hustled a naive Paul Newman in The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972), played a leper colony leader in Papillon (1973) and a former lawman gone bad in Rooster Cogburn (1975). Zerbe also starred alongside David Janssen in the television series Harry O (1973) as the urbane, nattily dressed Lieutenant K.C. Trench, Janssen's sometime nemesis, for which he picked up an Emmy Award. Definitely in strong demand for sinister roles, Zerbe played a crazed scientist in the corny KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park (1978), was an arrogant father in The Dead Zone (1983), made a great General Ulysses S. Grant in North and South, Book II (1986), starred in the military drama Opposing Force (1986) and suffered a grisly demise in an airlock full of money in the James Bond thriller Licence to Kill (1989). Most recently, Zerbe has been seen as Councillor Hamann in The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003). In addition to his extensive television and film appearances, Zerbe has appeared in Broadway productions including \"The Little Foxes\", \"Terra Nova\" and \"Solomon's Child\". He was in residence for five summer seasons at The Old Globe Theatre playing several key Shakespearean characters to strong critical acclaim. He has also held residencies at the Theatre of the Living Arts in Philadelphia, the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston. In 2003, he toured across several states with Roscoe Lee Browne in their production of \"Behind the Broken Words\", a performance of 20th-century poetry, comedy and drama.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NDI0NDk4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg0MjMzMDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001875","name":"Anthony Zerbe","nicknames":["Bug"],"idIMDB":"nm0001875"},"actorId":"nm0001875","character":"Arco the Magnificent","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"J.D.
