It's a battle for love where Sebastian finally has to realise that he has to let Ellie loose, find the strength within himself and not let his happiness depend on someone else.","simplePlot":"A gritty story taking place in Stockholm, about the passionate love between the self-abusive Sebastian who wants to be a woman, and the easy-going Andreas who is certainly not gay.","actors":[{"actorName":"Saga Becker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6223103","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Saga Becker is known for her work on Something must break (2014) and Efter Tio (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6223103","name":"Saga Becker","idIMDB":"nm6223103"},"actorId":"nm6223103","character":"Sebastian / Ellie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Iggy Malmborg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3946517","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Iggy Malmborg is an actor, known for Something must break (2014), Young Sophie Bell (2014) and Echoes from the Dead (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3946517","name":"Iggy Malmborg","idIMDB":"nm3946517"},"actorId":"nm3946517","character":"Andreas","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shima Niavarani","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3118731","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzc5ODA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkzMDAzODE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 July 1985","placeOfBirth":" Teheran, Iran","height":"5' 5¾\" (1.67 m)","bio":"Shima Niavarani was born on July 7, 1985 in Teheran, Iran.
