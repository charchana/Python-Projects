He was born in Tsingtao, China, to Japanese parents and grew up in Dalian. He did not set foot in Japan until he was 21. His father was an importer and a commercial photographer, and young Toshiro worked in his father's studio for a time after graduating from Dalian Middle School. He was automatically drafted into the Japanese army when he turned 20, and enlisted in the Air Force where he was attached to the Aerial Photography Unit for the duration of the World War II. In 1947 he took a test for Kajirô Yamamoto, who recommended him to director Senkichi Taniguchi, thus leading to Mifune's first film role in These Foolish Times II (1947). Mifune then met and bonded with director Akira Kurosawa, and the two joined to become the most prominent actor-director pairing in all Japanese cinema. Beginning with Drunken Angel (1948), Mifune appeared in 16 of Kurosawa's films, most of which have become world-renowned classics. In Kurosawa's pictures, especially Rashomon (1950), Mifune would become the most famous Japanese actor in the world. A dynamic and ferocious actor, he excelled in action roles, but also had the depth to plumb intricate and subtle dramatic parts. A personal rift during the filming of Red Beard (1965) ended the Mifune-Kurosawa collaboration, but Mifune continued to perform leading roles in major films both in Japan and in foreign countries. He was twice named Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (for Yojimbo (1961) and Red Beard (1965)). In 1963 he formed his own production company, directing one film and producing several others. In his later years he gained new fame in the title role of the American TV miniseries Shogun (1980), and appeared infrequently in cameo roles after that. His last years were plagued with Alzheimer's Syndrome and he died of organ failure in 1997, a few months before the death of the director with whose name he will forever be linked, Akira Kurosawa.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NzE2MzEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5MTU4Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536","name":"Toshirô Mifune","nicknames":["The Wolf","The Shogun"],"idIMDB":"nm0001536"},"actorId":"nm0001536","character":"Sanjûrô Tsubaki / The Samurai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002066","main":true},{"actorName":"Tatsuya Nakadai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619938","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzYwNDA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDExMTMwNw@@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1932","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","birthName":"Motohisa Nakadai","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Japanese leading man, an important star and one of the handful of Japanese actors well known outside Japan.

And just as Uehara embodied the idea of a modern Japanese wartime hero, Kayama became symbolic of postwar Japanese affluence and confidence, most famously in his title role in the 17 original \"Young Guy\" (Wakadaishô) movies for his father's home studio, Toho. A popular singer as well as an actor, Kayama specialized in romantic comedies that encouraged him to break spontaneously into song, as showcased even in movies where he wasn't playing the Young Guy, such as Oyome ni oide (1966). Though like his father he also starred in some of Toho's war films, and crime and action thrillers such as his debut Man Against Man (1960), he largely bypassed serious dramas until Akira Kurosawa tapped him for the lead alongside 'Toshiro Mifune' in Red Beard (1965), the two-year shoot of which Kayama found the most difficult experience of his life, but which also yielded the work of which he is proudest. Other than a single return to the Young Guy character, Kaettekita wakadaishô (1981), ten years after leaving the series, Kayama, also like his father, in later years moved towards playing a series of kindly authority figures, while still maintaining his romantic appeal to nostalgic audiences with musical appearances on the stage and on television.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443232","name":"Yûzô Kayama","idIMDB":"nm0443232"},"actorId":"nm0443232","character":"Iori Izaka","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Reiko Dan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199029","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 March 1935","placeOfBirth":" Kyoto City, Japan","bio":"Reiko Dan was born on March 26, 1935 in Kyoto City, Japan.

A native of southern Japan, Shimura was a descendant of the samurai warrior class. Following university training, he founded a theatre company, Shichigatsu-za (\"July Theatre\"). In 1930 he joined a professional company, Kindai-za (\"Modern Theatre\"). Four years later he signed with the Kinema Shinko film studio. He found a niche playing samurai roles for various studios, then signed a long-term contract with Toho Studios in 1943. He appeared in an average of six films a year for Toho over the next four decades. His greatest critical acclaim came in more than 20 roles for Kurosawa, though he is almost as well recognized outside Japan for his kindly doctor role in the original \"Godzilla\" (Godzilla (1954)). Shimura's triumph was his unforgettable performance as a dying bureaucrat in Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952). He continued to act steadily, in good films and bad, almost until his death, culminating with Kurosawa's Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980). He is often described as filling the spot for Kurosawa that Ward Bond filled for John Ford--an ever-present and reliable character player who consistently supplied a solidity and strength to whatever film he appeared in. Shimura was, to be sure, even a finer actor than Bond, and his range was enormous, from \"Ikiru\"'s diffident clerk to the leader of the Seven Samurai in Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954). He died in 1982, a reluctant icon of Japanese cinema.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjY0ODYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg0MTc4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793766","name":"Takashi Shimura","idIMDB":"nm0793766"},"actorId":"nm0793766","character":"Kurofuji","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kamatari Fujiwara","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0297869","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBmYjkyYzQtNTg0Yy00YjQ5LWI3ZWYtOTg2MjYyYzNkMTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 January 1905","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","bio":"Kamatari Fujiwara was born on January 15, 1905 in Tokyo, Japan.

Tsuchiya's father was a professor of literature at the prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo, and Tsuchiya grew up hearing as bedtime stories the works of William Shakespeare, of which Tsuchiya's father was the Japanese translator. Such a theatrical childhood no doubt stayed with Tsuchiya, who studied to be a doctor, and did indeed complete medical school. But he still felt drawn to acting, and so joined the highly regarded Hayuza theater group. He intended to do stage work entirely at first, until Akira Kurosawa persuaded him to audition for SHICHININ NO SAMURAI in 1952. Though reluctant at first, Tsuchiya acted his audition with such vigor that Kurosawa was bowled over. So was the public at large when Tsuchiya's fiery Rikichi, the most passionate of all the farmers in SEVEN SAMURAI, made his mark upon the film's release in 1954. Toho began to groom Tsuchiya as a star in the making, but he was less interested in fame than in the quality of roles he played. Kurosawa, too, was intensely protective of his discovery, counseling the young actor to work only with directors of quality. Early in 1957, Kurosawa introduced Tsuchiya to one such director, his close friend Ishiro Honda, whose classic GOJIRA had made its mark in the same year as SEVEN SAMURAI. Tsuchiya and Honda took to each other immediately--in later years he would call Kurosawa and Honda \"my other two fathers\"--and the actor, an avid UFO buff, impressed the director by insisting on the role of the Mysterian commander in their first science fiction collaboration, EARTH DEFENSE FORCE (1957). Since the Commander's face was never to be seen, Honda had had no illusions of getting a first-rate actor to play the part, and actually tried to talk Tsuchiya out of it. Toho, too, wanted him to play a role with a face the audience would get to see. But the iconoclastic Tsuchiya prevailed, and Honda was very touched by his persistence. He acted in numerous pictures for Honda through 1970, when he largely retired from movies in favor of the stage. After appearing in nearly every Kurosawa film after 1954, their collaboration came to an end with RED BEARD in 1965. (The two-year shoot had cost Tsuchiya a role in Honda's popular monster picture EARTH'S GREATEST BATTLE, 1964.) Kurosawa attempted to cast Tsuchiya in both KAGEMUSHA and RAN, but Tsuchiya's stage schedules would not permit. He did, however, narrate as well as appear in a 1991 TV documentary on the making of SEVEN SAMURAI. That same year, he made his first appearance in a monster film in over 20 years, playing the self-important magnate Shindo in GOJIRA VS. KING GHIDORA, which became one of his very favorite acting jobs. Tsuchiya's fierce but controlled persona has not dulled with age, and he remains more in demand than his schedule can handle. He still prefers the stage to films or TV, and usually does at least one stage tour a year. He is also a noted essayist, on subjects ranging from his work with Kurosawa to his interest in UFOs; several books of his work have been published.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875237","name":"Yoshio Tsuchiya","idIMDB":"nm0875237"},"actorId":"nm0875237","character":"Samurai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kunie Tanaka","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0848993","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 November 1932","placeOfBirth":" Gifu, Japan","height":"5' 5¾\" (1.67 m)","bio":"Kunie Tanaka was born on November 23, 1932 in Gifu, Japan.
