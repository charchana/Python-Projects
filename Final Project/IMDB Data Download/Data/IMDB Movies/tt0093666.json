An often quoted phrase of Hoffman is \"I have a dark look on human motives\", dating from his debut film Luger (1982) under direction of Theo van Gogh. He also considers himself more \"a hardworking man than a gifted actor\" as well as someone \"who is hard to put in one category.\" He played main roles in more than sixty movies and TV-series, with directors ranging from Sally Potter, Harry Kumel, Lars Von Trier, Paul Verhoeven to the radical South-African filmmaker Ian Kerkhof. Many Years since The Fourth Man (1982) and his awarded role in Avonden, De (1989), Verhoevens movie Blackbook put him back in the international arena. Hoffman also directed several documentaries about filmmakers he admires, and is a successful photographer. In 2004 French star Jeanne Moreau officially received the first copy of Hoffman's book \"FOTO's Thom Hoffman\" during the international Ghent Film Festival.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzOTUxMzA3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTkzNTA3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0389109","name":"Thom Hoffman","idIMDB":"nm0389109"},"actorId":"nm0389109","character":"Bart Buisman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Devika Strooker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0835084","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1963","placeOfBirth":" Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands","birthName":"Devika Rustom Strooker","bio":"Devika Strooker was born on December 13, 1963 in Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands as Devika Rustom Strooker.

Fluent in several languages, he was reported to have escaped a concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Holland by disguising himself as one of the German officers he would later play so often on both big and small screens. Though he bookended and sprinkled his career with appearances in many European films, Van Dreelen is best remembered as an A-list guest star in dozens of American television shows from the early 1960s to the mid-'80s. Never a major player in American theatrical films, he nonetheless scored a few choice roles, including the Danish concert pianist who rescues and woos Lana Turner during an extended sequence in Madame X (1966). Van Dreelen also enjoyed an international stage career and starred in the original American touring production of \"The Sound of Music.\" Despite his close identification with despotic roles, he also easily breezed through light drama and comedy and cut a dashing and memorable figure in 1960s pop culture oeuvre.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgxYzJmZTItMmEyNi00Yjk4LTk1YmYtY2ExOWVhODBlNjU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0886657","name":"John Van Dreelen","idIMDB":"nm0886657"},"actorId":"nm0886657","character":"Dr. Alexander De Winter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mavis Helneyer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993059","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Mavis Helneyer is an actress, known for Odyssée d'amour (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993059","name":"Mavis Helneyer","idIMDB":"nm0993059"},"actorId":"nm0993059","character":"Aida","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lilian van Everdingen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993006","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Lilian van Everdingen is an actress, known for De ratelrat (1987), Odyssée d'amour (1987) and Amsterdamned (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993006","name":"Lilian van Everdingen","idIMDB":"nm0993006"},"actorId":"nm0993006","character":"Isabel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Laura Quast","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993663","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Laura Quast is an actress, known for Odyssée d'amour (1987) and Ogen van krijt (1978).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993663","name":"Laura Quast","idIMDB":"nm0993663"},"actorId":"nm0993663","character":"Koningin van de Nacht","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Myrena Sint Jago","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993313","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Myrena Sint Jago is an actress, known for Odyssée d'amour (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993313","name":"Myrena Sint Jago","idIMDB":"nm0993313"},"actorId":"nm0993313","character":"Cecilia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kenneth Herdigein","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378823","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 June 1959","placeOfBirth":" Paramaribo, Suriname","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"Kenneth Herdigein was born on June 12, 1959 in Paramaribo, Suriname.
