Horst Frank financed his acting studies by working part-time as a babysitter and night watchman. He actually failed his final exams at the Musikhochschule Hamburg, but nonetheless managed to secure an acting position in his home town. For some time after, his work was primarily confined to small parts on stage and in radio. His first screen role saw him as a cowardly pilot in Der Stern von Afrika (1957). Frank then won a critic's award for his next role as member of a U-Boat crew in the war drama UB 55, corsaire de l'océan (1957). Of athletic, lithe build and owner of a somewhat cold, hypnotic gaze (with a voice to match), Frank soon found himself typecast to disturbingly good effect as psychotic murderers in German and international productions (The Black Panther of Ratana (1963), La jeune fille de Moorhof (1958), L'étau (1958)). Alternatively, he proved an ideal henchman for spaghetti westerns (Bullets Don't Argue (1964), Johnny Hamlet (1968) and Django, Prepare a Coffin (1968)). Frank didn't seem to mind turning out copies of the same negative in a seemingly endless gallery of ruthless killers and impassive assassins. He did so with relish well into the 1980's and 90's, enjoying guest spots on popular TV crime time shows like Tatort (1970) and Inspecteur Derrick (1974). If Horst Frank was in the cast, you knew pretty much from the start 'whodunnit'. Behind the menacing heavy, there was a family man and author of poems and chansons. In addition to his screen acting, Frank lent his voice to dubbing work (for the likes of fellow tough guys Jack Palance, Ernest Borgnine and Chuck Connors); and to radio, where he voiced Captain Nemo in \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"The Mysterious Island\". Likely because of his lack of work in major American or British productions, Frank never quite achieved the international recognition he undoubtedly deserved. He died quite suddenly in May 1999 of a brain hemorrhage, just short of his 70th birthday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ2YTQ5MjMtMDExMC00MTQyLTkxYTEtYmQwYmE2Y2EzZGQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290955","name":"Horst Frank","idIMDB":"nm0290955"},"actorId":"nm0290955","character":"Leutnant Legget","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Klaus Kinski","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001428","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyOTgwMDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAxNTIzNA@@._V1_UY44_CR11,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 October 1926","placeOfBirth":" Zoppot, Free City of Danzig [now Sopot, Pomorskie, Poland]","birthName":"Nikolaus Günther Nakszynski","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Klaus Kinski was born Nikolaus Günther Nakszynski in Zoppot, Free City of Danzig (now Sopot, Poland), to Susanne (Lutze), a nurse, and Bruno Nakszynski, a pharmacist. He grew up in Berlin, was drafted into the German army in 1944 and captured by British forces in Holland. After the war he began acting on the stage, quickly gaining a reputation for his ferocious talent and equally ferocious temper. He started acting in films shortly afterwards, showing an utter disregard for the quality of the productions he appeared in and churning out so many that a complete filmography is almost impossible to assemble. However, he did turn out memorable work for director Werner Herzog, a similarly driven and obsessive character. Herzog and Kinski pushed each other to extremes over a 15-year working relationship, which finally ended after filming Cobra Verde (1987), a production plagued by volcanic clashes between the star and director, involving--among other things--violent physical altercations and mutual death threats. Kinski subsequently directed and starred in the notorious Paganini (1989), his only film as director and which was marked by (again) clashes between Kinski and his producers, who accused him of turning their movie into a pornographic film and sued him in court. His autobiography \"All I Need is Love\", one of the most vicious attacks on the film business ever written, was withdrawn for legal reasons and subsequently re-released as \"Kinski Uncut\" in the US & UK, \"Ich brauche Liebe\" in Germany, and in various other languages.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyOTgwMDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAxNTIzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001428","name":"Klaus Kinski","idIMDB":"nm0001428"},"actorId":"nm0001428","character":"Speranzo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brad Harris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364490","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM3NjQ4ZGItNDA2ZC00ZDY3LTkzYmYtZDRhM2I0ODgzODJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 July 1933","placeOfBirth":" St. Anthony, Idaho, USA","birthName":"Bradford Jan Harris","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Born in St. Anthony, a small town in eastern Idaho, Bradford Harris attended UCLA in the early 1950s, where he played fullback on the football team while studying economics. His studies may have been intended as the groundwork for a career in his family's banking business, but Harris instead drifted into the fringes of Los Angeles' movie industry, and secured employment as a stunt man. In the late 1950s he traveled to Europe as the stunt co-ordinator for a German-Italian co-production. Soon he found himself working as a second-unit director, and that led to a starring role in Goliath Against the Giants (1961). His good looks and muscular build kept him in demand during the era of \"sword and sandal\" movies, and when this genre began to fade away, he moved into \"spaghetti westerns\" and a spate of action movies with an emphasis on spy thrillers. In 1967 he married actress Olga Schoberová.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM3NjQ4ZGItNDA2ZC00ZDY3LTkzYmYtZDRhM2I0ODgzODJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364490","name":"Brad Harris","idIMDB":"nm0364490"},"actorId":"nm0364490","character":"Donald Ramsey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dominique Boschero","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0097802","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlkNWI1NDYtNTIwMi00OWQyLTkxYjAtMWMwYjhjOWZmODVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 April 1934","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","bio":"Dominique Boschero was born on April 27, 1934 in Paris, France.
