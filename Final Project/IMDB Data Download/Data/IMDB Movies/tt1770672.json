Her natural born talent was noticed and she was cast in practically every production at school and continued equally throughout her high school years. At the age of 15, Razane was scouted into the modeling world and her professional life spiraled and she was much in demand. She maintained focus on her studies and commendably managed to juggle between studying for her French Baccalaureat while working part-time as a model, traveling all around the Middle-East for big brand TV commercials such as Nivea, Lux, Showtime, Du, Maymouna, Mtc touch, Cadbury and many more. At the age of 18, she moved to London to continue her studies and enrolled for business management degree at the prestigious Kings College. Although intensively engrossed in obtaining a postgraduate degree which she completed with Honours, Razane never lost sight of what she really wanted, to become an actress. Every summer, she enrolled in demanding acting workshops such as the 'Cours Florent' in Paris, The 'RADA' in London and the 'NYFA' in New York. She also joined MOT modelling agency followed by BMA, which allowed her modelling career to take off again, this time in London. She was featured on many covers of local magazines and filmed numerous commercials. In 2009, she was cast in her first feature film role in, 'Carlos', directed by Olivier Assayas. After completing the film and finishing with her business management degree, she directed her full time attention to her acting training and joined the Actor's Temple in London with Gary Condez, where she trained in the Meisner Technique. In 2010, her career progression led her to move to Los Angeles to gain further acting training and widen her network. In 2011, she was cast as the lead role in the feature film, \"Djinn\" directed by Toby Hooper (Texas Chain Saw Massacre). The film was shot in Dubai and was released at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival in 2013. She was then cast in a supporting role in her third feature film,\"Flying Blind\", released in 2012 across Europe. Noticing her acting credits lacked comedy listing in 2012; Razane actively devised, wrote, produced and played the lead role of a light web comedy, \"Giselle\" (a Lebanese bimbo). This experience led her to be cast in the role of Joyce (Ditsy Secretary) in the web series \"Mamnou3\" (2012), and afterwards \"Mimi the mermaid\" (Hipster Mermaid). Razane was also cast as the queen in Kanye West's short film/art installation \"Cruel Summer\". In late 2012, Razane re-located to New York adding another base platform to her acting career. In 2013 she completed a movie with Scott Frank, \"A walk among the tombstones\", starring Liam Neeson and Dan Stevens. The movie is set to be released in September 2013. From February to June 2014, Razane re-located to Egypt to film an Egyptian Tv-series \"Emratoreyet Meen\" starring Hind Sabry. The show was aired during the month of Ramandan, July 2014. Having completed her work in Egypt, Razane then moved to France for the summer to film a movie with Robert Guediguian. The last part of the film is set to be filmed in Beirut in September 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxODkzNTE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM1MzY0OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3943919","name":"Razane Jammal","idIMDB":"nm3943919"},"actorId":"nm3943919","character":"Salama","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ahd","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2269188","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDk5ZmQ3YjUtNDgxZi00YzU5LTljNzAtZWQ4NTgwOWNhOTRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUwNzY0Mw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Ahd is an actress, filmmaker from Saudi Arabia.
