His mother was Irish, from County Longford, while his American-born father is of mostly Irish descent. Mel and his family moved to Australia in the late 1960s, settling in New South Wales, where Mel's paternal grandmother, contralto opera singer Eva Mylott, was born. After high school, Mel studied at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, performing at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts alongside future film thespians Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush. After college, Mel had a few stints on stage and starred in a few TV shows. Eventually, he was chosen to star in Mad Max (1979) and in a movie called Tim (1979), co-starring Piper Laurie. The small budgeted movie Mad Max (1979) made him known worldwide, while Tim (1979) garnered him an award for Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute (equivalent to the Oscar). Later, he went on to star in Gallipoli (1981), which earned him a second award for Best Actor from the AFI. In 1980, he married Robyn Moore and had seven children. In 1984, Mel made his American debut in The Bounty (1984), which co-starred Anthony Hopkins. Then in 1987, Mel starred in what would become his signature series, Lethal Weapon (1987), in which he played \"Martin Riggs\". In 1990, he took on the interesting starring role in Hamlet (1990), which garnered him some critical praise. He also made the more endearing Forever Young (1992) and the somewhat disturbing The Man Without a Face (1993). 1995 brought his most famous role as \"Sir William Wallace\" in Braveheart (1995), for which he won two Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. From there, he made such box office hits as The Patriot (2000), Ransom (1996), and Payback (1999). Today, Mel remains an international superstar mogul, continuously topping the Hollywood power lists as well as the Most Beautiful and Sexiest lists.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUzOTMwNTM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMTUxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000154","name":"Mel Gibson","idIMDB":"nm0000154"},"actorId":"nm0000154","character":"Rocky","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008228","main":true},{"actorName":"Tony Haygarth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371304","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDAwNzg3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI5NjUzOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 February 1945","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, England, UK","birthName":"George Anthony Haygarth","bio":"Instantly recognisable, often bearded Liverpudlian character actor who has been regularly featured on stage and screen in period productions, police dramas, sitcoms and soaps during a career spanning five decades. Extremely prolific and versatile, he has taken on just about any type of role, merrily alternating between bellicose, shifty, dependable, bucolic, curmudgeonly or avuncular types. His most prominent headliners have included PC Wilmot in the Yorkshire-based sitcom Rosie (1977) and the titular character of the sci-fi comedy Kinvig (1981) penned by Nigel Kneale. Occasional scene-stealing turns in support have included the deliriously mad Milo Renfield in Dracula (1979). Among innumerable other worthy supporting roles a list of standouts might comprise Gridley, the ruined chancery appellant in Bleak House (2005) ; Vic Snow in Where the Heart Is (1997) ; nouveau-riche timber merchant Melbury in The Woodlanders (1997) and the slightly seedy consular chauffeur Fidel Sanchez in Farrington of the F.O. (1986). He also voiced the slow-witted, mercilessly hen-pecked antagonist Mr. Tweedy in Aardman's animated feature Chicken Run (2000). Before claimed by the stage, Haygarth had briefly tried his luck at other fields of endeavour, including as a Torquay lifeguard and as a psychiatric nurse at Sefton Hospital in Liverpool. Having found his chosen vocation in repertory theatre he went from there to more distinguished roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Old Vic and the National Theatre. He won the Clarence Derwent Award in 1996 for his part in the play \"Simpatico\" and in 2003 appeared with Zoë Wanamaker in \"His Girl Friday\" and alongside Kenneth Branagh in \"Edmond\". Starting in 2007, he appeared as Alfred Doolittle in Peter Hall's production of \"Pygmalion\", a performance described by the reviewer of The Telegraph as \"delightfully funny\" and \"scene-stealing\". Haygarth also sidelined as an author of plays and wrote a book of poetry entitled \"God wore Clogs\". In 2014, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia which sadly claimed his life three years later at the age of 72.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDAwNzg3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI5NjUzOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371304","name":"Tony Haygarth","idIMDB":"nm0371304"},"actorId":"nm0371304","character":"Mr. Tweedy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008237","main":true},{"actorName":"Jane Horrocks","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001363","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzIxNjI5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIyODI0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 January 1964","placeOfBirth":" Rossendale Valley, Lancashire, England, UK","birthName":"Barbara Jane Horrocks","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Jane Horrocks was born January 18, 1964 in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, England, UK, she is the youngest of three children born to Barbara and John Horrocks.

The play was adapted into a film in which Jane reprised her role as Little Voice (1998).

She has one sister, eight years her senior. Her parents and sister are not involved in the performing arts. At an early age she performed in school plays, having shown a talent and desire to \"turn herself into\" other people. She has referred to it as \"an emotional fusion; you think yourself into them\". This mimicry could be of school friends or film stars. She left school (Southport High School for Girls) at the age of 17, and originally intended becoming a vet. She also considered studying English literature in college, but decided to concentrate on drama and enrolled at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (as did many well-known British actors). After three years she graduated and moved into repertory theatre. She became affiliated with the Library Theatre in Manchester in 1979, where she became an assistant stage manager. She obtained her Equity card, and after several regional productions, first appeared on the London stage (Moving at Queens Theatre) in 1981. British television roles soon followed, and then film. Since then, Miranda has moved into the international arena, and has made films in America, France and Spain. Television work (on both sides of the Atlantic) continues, as does some stage work. Her roles are diverse, but powerful and engaging. She has been quoted as stating \"what I basically like is doing things I haven't done before\" and this continually comes through in the variety of roles she has played in her career. She is also selective in the roles she takes, being uninterested in performing in the standard Hollywood fare, and preferring more offbeat roles. She was approached to play the Glenn Close role in Fatal Attraction (1987), but found it \"regressive in its attitudes\". Her attitude is summed up by a quote from an interview that appeared in the New York Times (Dec 27 1992): \"I would rather do many small roles on TV, stage or film than one blockbuster that made me rich but had no acting. And if that's the choice I have to make, I think I've already made it\". According to \"1994 Current Biography Yearbook\", she resides in South London with her two Siamese cats, Otis and Waldo. She has now moved to West London. Her hobbies include drawing, walking, gardening, fashion, falconry, and music. She, by her own admission, is a loner and lives rather modestly. An actor who studied with Ms Richardson at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre in the late 1970s described her as \"a strong minded, specially gifted, rather pretty young woman who enjoys wearing jewelry. She wore toe rings, which in the late 1970s and especially in England, were a rarity and considered rather racy.\" He also remarked on her drive, even then, to be an actress of the highest caliber.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NzM2ODE5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAyMDc0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001669","name":"Miranda Richardson","idIMDB":"nm0001669"},"actorId":"nm0001669","character":"Mrs. Tweedy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008229","main":true},{"actorName":"Julia Sawalha","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0768018","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5ODE0MDA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA5NjUzOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 September 1968","placeOfBirth":" Wandsworth, London, England, UK","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Julia Sawalha has made many film and television appearances since her debut role as Lynda Day on Press Gang (1989), though she has always said that the character that resembles her real-life personality most is Lynda.
