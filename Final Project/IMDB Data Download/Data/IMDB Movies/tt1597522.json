Young delinquent and wanderer in the past, Depardieu started his acting career at the small traveling theatre \"Cafe de la Gare\", along with Patrick Dewaere and Miou-Miou. After minor roles in cinema, at last, he got his chance in Bertrand Blier's Going Places (1974). That film established a new type of hero in the French cinema and the actor's popularity grew enormously. Later, he diversified his screen image and became the leading French actor of the 80s and 90s. He was twice awarded a César as Best Actor for Le dernier métro (1980) and Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), also received an Oscar nomination for \"Cyrano\" and a number of awards at international film festivals. In 1996, he was distinguished by the highest French title of \"Chevalier du Légion d'Honneur\". He married Elisabeth Depardieu in 1971, and they divorced in 1996; she appeared with him in Jean de Florette (1986) and Manon of the Spring (1986); their children Guillaume Depardieu and Julie Depardieu are both actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDU4OTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwODY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367","name":"Gérard Depardieu","idIMDB":"nm0000367"},"actorId":"nm0000367","character":"Obélix","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011778","main":true},{"actorName":"Edouard Baer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0046347","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MjE4NDU2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg0Mjk5Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 December 1966","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Edouard Baer was born on December 1, 1966 in Paris, France.

Her parents were actors. She made her movie debut in 1957, when she was thirteen and continued with small parts in minor films, until Roger Vadim gave her a meatier role in Le vice et la vertu (1963). But her breakthrough came with the excellent musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), in which she gave an unforgettable performance as a romantic middle-class girl who falls in love with a young soldier but gets imprisoned in a loveless marriage with another man; the director was the gifted Jacques Demy, who also cast Deneuve in the less successful The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967). She then played a schizophrenic killer in Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and a married woman who works as a part-time prostitute every afternoon in Luis Buñuel's masterpiece Belle de Jour (1967). She also worked with Buñuel in Tristana (1970) and gave a great performance for François Truffaut in Mississippi Mermaid (1969), a kind of apotheosis of her \"frigid femme fatale\" persona. In the seventies she didn't find parts of that caliber, but her magnificent work in Truffaut's Le dernier métro (1980) as a stage actress in Nazi-occupied Paris revived her career. She was also very good in the recent epic drama Indochine (1992), for which she earned her first Academy Award nomination (Best Actress). Although the elegant and always radiant Deneuve has never appeared on stage, she is universally hailed as one of the \"grandes dames\" of French cinema, joining a list that includes such illustrious talents as Simone Signoret, Jeanne Moreau, Isabelle Huppert, Isabelle Adjani and the younger Juliette Binoche.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NDQ2MjYwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ0MDM2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000366","name":"Catherine Deneuve","idIMDB":"nm0000366"},"actorId":"nm0000366","character":"Reine Cordelia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0386811","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlotte Le Bon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3114649","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwODIzODkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg4NTEwMDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1986","placeOfBirth":" Montréal, Québec, Canada","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Charlotte Le Bon was born on September 4, 1986 in Montréal, Québec, Canada.

Born in 1930, he trained at the Paris Conservatoire but had to halt his studies due to military service. Relocating to Paris, he developed a minor name for himself in cabaret and stage plays. He also worked with the Grenier-Hussenot company at this time and acted in TV drama. Throughout his career Rochefort would return sporadically to the theatre as both actor and director. Films took his immediate focus in the late 50s and he became an audience favorite in roguish costumers and adventure films, particularly those of director Philippe De Broca, including Swords of Blood (1962), Up to His Ears (1965) and The Devil by the Tail (1969). By the 70s, Rochefort's reputation as a comedy star of sex farces and black comedies was firmly established, culminating with his classic roles in The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1972), Conspiratia (1973), Le fantôme de la liberté (1974), Affreux, sales et méchants (1976) and Pardon Mon Affaire (1976). He won the Cesar Award (French equivalent of the 'Oscar') for best supporting actor in The Clockmaker of St. Paul (1974) and the best actor trophy for Le Crabe-Tambour (1977). Though he branched out internationally in later years, he earned more kudos for his work in French-made films, especially those directed by Patrice Leconte: Tandem (1987), The Hairdresser's Husband (1990) and the Oscar-nominated Ridicule (1996). Most recently he won praise co-starring as a retired teacher of poetry opposite actor Johnny Hallyday in Man on the Train (2002). Despite his obvious comedic electricity, he has touched audiences as well playing dying naval captains, paraplegics, and timorous, elderly dreamers, often drawing both humor and pathos simultaneously from his characters. Not as well known by America's standards, his sunken, weary features, ever-searching eyes, ever-present moustache and prominent nose are unmistakable in the over 80 films he's graced. A lifetime dream was to play Don Quixote on film and his wish was nearly fulfilled until he took seriously ill and the project had to be indefinitely shelved after only a few days of filming. Rochefort received a special life's achievement Cesar award in 1999.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTY0MDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkxMTY1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734000","name":"Jean Rochefort","nicknames":["Mon petit Jeannot","Jeannot"],"idIMDB":"nm0734000"},"actorId":"nm0734000","character":"Lucius Fouinus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gérard Jugnot","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432040","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNTgzMTI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc4MDEwMg@@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 May 1951","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Gérard Jugnot was born on May 4, 1951 in Paris, France.
