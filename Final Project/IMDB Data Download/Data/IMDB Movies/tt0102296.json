Famed for her tiny, slim body and disproportionately large implanted breasts, and the lengths she goes to to hide her assets. Her film roles often show self deprecating humour. She knows why she's there, she know's what you want to see, but through cleverly contrived camera angles you never ever see what she promises you might - the famed \"Yip Tease\". There have long been numerous rumours of an eminent return to movies which have yet to come to fruition.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001867","name":"Amy Yip","idIMDB":"nm0001867"},"actorId":"nm0001867","character":"Fairy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0102296","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102296","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 36 min (96 min) (Australia)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"5.2","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"126","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0053302","name":"Diagonal Pictures"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["woman on top","cunnilingus","female nudity","male nudity","pubic hair","coitus","sex","sequel"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 10:19:33"}}
