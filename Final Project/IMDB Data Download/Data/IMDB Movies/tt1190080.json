Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John's siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago's Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall's geek brigade in Sixteen Candles (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like The Sure Thing (1985) and Better Off Dead... (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything... (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in The Grifters (1990). The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins' Actors' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack's high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime's first feature was the sharply written comedy Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film's financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack's next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case. Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby's popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he's so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He's also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn't reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTAwMjYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxNTU1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131","name":"John Cusack","nicknames":["Johnny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000131"},"actorId":"nm0000131","character":"Jackson Curtis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0117847","main":true},{"actorName":"Amanda Peet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001605","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3Nzk0NjgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI3NDE1Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 January 1972","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Amanda Peet was born and raised in New York City. She is the daughter of Penny (Levy), a social worker, and Charles Peet, a lawyer, and has an older sister. Her father was of mostly English and German ancestry, and her mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany, Russia, and Hungary). Peet's great-grandfathers were politician Samuel Levy and showbiz impresario S.L. Rothafel. Peet made an unconventional stage debut at the age of three, when she jumped onto the stage during a play. Yet, despite this early start, she later studied acting more as a hobby than anything else. She studied history at Columbia University, where a drama professor convinced her to audition for acting teacher Uta Hagen, with whom she later went on to study for a four-year period. During this time, she participated in the off-Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's \"Awake and Sing.\" She supported herself during the audition phase of her career by working as a waitress and with the residual checks she received from a Skittles candy commercial. Perseverance and hard work paid off, and, in 1995, she was cast in a guest-starring role on the hit series Law & Order (1990). Her feature film debut came in 1995 with the movie Animal Room (1995). For a while afterward, Amanda continued to find steady work but also found herself appearing in a depressingly large number of indie films that were never picked up for distribution. She did, however, meet her boyfriend Brian Van Holt on the set of indie movie Whipped (2000). Her turn as the ditzy hit-woman with the heart of gold in the hit comedy The Whole Nine Yards (2000), opposite Bruce Willis, took her from supporting role status to leading lady. That same year she was voted one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World by \"People\" Magazine.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3Nzk0NjgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI3NDE1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001605","name":"Amanda Peet","idIMDB":"nm0001605"},"actorId":"nm0001605","character":"Kate Curtis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0163665","main":true},{"actorName":"Chiwetel Ejiofor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252230","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5MDEyMTY3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ0MjcxMDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 July 1977","placeOfBirth":" Forest Gate, London, England, UK","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"English actor Chiwetel Ejiofor is renowned for his portrayal of Solomon Northup in 12 Years a Slave (2013), for which he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, along with the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. He is also known for playing Okwe in Dirty Pretty Things (2002), the Operative in Serenity (2005), Lola in Kinky Boots (2005), Luke in Children of Men (2006), Dr. Adrian Helmsley in 2012 (2009) and Dr. Vincent Kapoor in The Martian (2015). Chiwetelu Umeadi Ejiofor was born on July 10, 1977 in Forest Gate, London, England, to Nigerian parents, Obiajulu (Okaford), a pharmacist, and Arinze Ejiofor, a doctor. Chiwetel attended Dulwich College in South-East London. By the age of 13 he was appearing in numerous school and National Youth Theatre productions and subsequently attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. In 1996 Ejiofor caught the attention of Steven Spielberg who cast him in the critically acclaimed Amistad (1997) alongside Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins. He has since been seen on the big screen in numerous features including Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things (2002) (for which he won Best Actor at the British Independent Film Awards, the Evening Standard Film Awards, and the San Diego Film Critics Society Awards), Love Actually (2003), Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda (2004), Kinky Boots (2005), Inside Man (2006), Children of Men (2006), American Gangster (2007), and Talk to Me (2007), for which his performance won him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ejiofor has balanced his film and television commitments with a number of prestigious stage productions. In 2008 his performance in the title role of Michael Grandage's \"Othello\" at the Donmar Warehouse alongside Ewan McGregor was unanimously commended and won him best actor at the 2008 Olivier and Evening Standard Theatre Awards. He also received nominations in the South Bank Show Awards and the What's On Stage Theatregoers' Choice Awards in 2009. His other stage parts include Roger Michell's \"Blue/Orange\" in 2000 which received an Olivier Award for Best Play, and the same year Tim Supple's \"Romeo and Juliet\" in which Ejiofor took the title role. Following his television debut in 1996 in Screen Two: Deadly Voyage (1996), Ejiofor has complimented his film and theatre work on the small screen in productions including Murder in Mind (2001), created by the award-winning writer Anthony Horowitz, Trust (2003), Twelfth Night, or What You Will (2003), and Canterbury Tales (2003). His television appearance in 2006's hard hitting emotional drama Tsunami: The Aftermath (2006)alongside Toni Collette, Sophie Okonedo and Tim Roth earned him a nomination for a Golden Globe Award as well as an NAACP Image award. Ejiofor also appeared in such notable films as Endgame (2009), Channel 4's moving drama set in South Africa for which his performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries; Roland Emmerich's action feature 2012 (2009), opposite John Cusack, Danny Glover, and Thandie Newton; and Salt (2010), opposite Angelina Jolie and Liev Schreiber. In 2013, he starred in Half of a Yellow Sun (2013) and 12 Years a Slave (2013), receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for the latter film.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5MDEyMTY3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ0MjcxMDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252230","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor","idIMDB":"nm0252230"},"actorId":"nm0252230","character":"Adrian Helmsley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0268618","main":true},{"actorName":"Thandie Newton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628601","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MjAzMTI1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI5NTEwNjE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 November 1972","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Thandiwe Melanie Newton","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Thandie Newton was born in London.

At that time she enrolled in London's Art Educational School, where she studied modern dance. However, a back injury forced her to quit dancing. This led to her auditioning for films and receiving her first role in John Duigan's Flirting (1991). She then moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue acting and her then-boyfriend. Her British accent limited the amount of work she was getting, and she returned to Britain, where she went to Cambridge University to study, eventually receiving a degree in anthropology. Between semesters, she continued her acting and became noticed and in-demand for future film roles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MjAzMTI1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI5NTEwNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628601","name":"Thandie Newton","idIMDB":"nm0628601"},"actorId":"nm0628601","character":"Laura Wilson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0188501","main":true},{"actorName":"Oliver Platt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001624","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkzNDgzNjEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzODA0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 January 1960","placeOfBirth":" Windsor, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Oliver James Platt","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Oliver Platt was born in Windsor, Ontario, to American parents, Sheila Maynard, a social worker, and Nicholas Platt, a career diplomat.

He grew up in Lebanon, Ohio, and, after receiving degrees in theater arts and English from Hanover College, had a brief stint in New York theater. He was soon cast as Woody on TV series Cheers (1982), which wound up being one of the most-popular TV shows ever and also earned Harrelson an Emmy for his performance in 1989. While he dabbled in film during his time on Cheers (1982), that area of his career didn't fully take off until towards the end of the show's run. In 1991, Doc Hollywood (1991) gave him his first widely-seen movie role, and he followed that up with White Men Can't Jump (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993) and Natural Born Killers (1994). More recently, Harrelson was seen in No Country for Old Men (2007), Zombieland (2009), 2012 (2009), and Friends with Benefits (2011), along with the acclaimed HBO movie Game Change (2012). In 2011, Harrelson snagged the coveted role of fan-favorite drunk Haymitch Abernathy in the big-screen adaptation of The Hunger Games (2012), which ended up being one of the highest-grossing movies ever at the domestic box office. Harrelson is set to reprise that role for the sequels, which are scheduled for release in November 2013, 2014 and 2015. Harrelson has received two Academy Award nominations, first for his role as controversial Hustler founder Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and then for a role in The Messenger (2009). He also received Golden Globe nominations for both of these parts. In 2016, he had a stand-out role as a wise teacher in the teen drama The Edge of Seventeen (2016). Harrelson was briefly married to Nancy Simon in the 80s, and later married his former assistant, Laura Louie, with whom he has three daughters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NDc2ODc4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2MzAyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000437","name":"Woody Harrelson","idIMDB":"nm0000437"},"actorId":"nm0000437","character":"Charlie Frost","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0164737","main":true},{"actorName":"Danny Glover","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000418","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4ODM2MzQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY2OTI5MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 July 1946","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"Danny Lebern Glover","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Actor, producer and humanitarian Danny Glover has been a commanding presence on screen, stage and television for more than 25 years. Glover was born in San Francisco, California, to Carrie (Hunley) and James Glover, postal workers who were also active in civil rights. Glover trained at the Black Actors' Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater. It was his Broadway debut in Fugard's Master Harold...and the Boys, which brought him to national recognition and led director Robert Benton to cast Glover in his first leading role in 1984's Oscar®-nominated Best Picture Places in the Heart. The following year, Glover starred in two more Best Picture nominees: Peter Weir's Witness and Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple. In 1987, Glover partnered with Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon film and went on to star in three hugely successful Lethal Weapon sequels. Glover has also invested his talents in more personal projects, including the award-winning To Sleep With Anger, which he executive produced and for which he won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor; Bopha!; Manderlay; Missing in America; and the film version of Athol Fugard's play Boesman and Lena. On the small screen, Glover won an Image Award and a Cable ACE Award and earned an Emmy nomination for his performance in the title role of the HBO movie Mandela. He has also received Emmy nominations for his work in the acclaimed miniseries Lonesome Dove and the telefilm Freedom Song. As a director, he earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for Showtime's Just a Dream. Glover's film credits range from the blockbuster Lethal Weapon franchise to smaller independent features, some of which Glover also produced. He co-starred in the critically acclaimed feature Dreamgirls directed by Bill Condon and in Po' Boy's Game for director Clement Virgo. He appeared in the hit feature Shooter for director Antoine Fuqua, Honeydripper for director John Sayles, and Be Kind, Rewind for director Michel Gondry. Glover has also gained respect for his wide-reaching community activism and philanthropic efforts, with a particular emphasis on advocacy for economic justice, and access to health care and education programs in the United States and Africa. For these efforts, Glover received a 2006 DGA Honor. Internationally, Glover has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Program from 1998-2004, focusing on issues of poverty, disease, and economic development in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and serves as UNICEF Ambassador. In 2005, Glover co-founded Louverture Films dedicated to the development and production of films of historical relevance, social purpose, commercial value and artistic integrity. The New York based company has a slate of progressive features and documentaries including Trouble the Water, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, Africa Unite, award winning feature Bamako, and most recent projects Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, and The Disappearance of McKinley Nolan.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4ODM2MzQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY2OTI5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000418","name":"Danny Glover","idIMDB":"nm0000418"},"actorId":"nm0000418","character":"President Thomas Wilson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0164738","main":true},{"actorName":"Liam James","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416699","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NDgyOTk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyNjkzOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 August 1996","placeOfBirth":" Canada","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Liam James was born on August 7, 1996 in Canada.

When Johann was ten he moved to Finland with his mother and her new husband. They lived in several small towns until they finally settled in Tampere. At the age of 17 Johann moved to his father in New York where he soon started a modeling career. In 2001 he landed into small part in movie Zoolander (2001). After that he did a role in short movie Fear of Feathers (2003) and appeared in one episode of CSI: Miami (2002). In 2004 he got a part in short-running TV-show The Mountain (2004). After that he appeared as a guest in several TV-shows and made smaller film roles. In 2008 Johann got his first biggest film role in much hated The Hottie & the Nottie (2008). In 2009 things seemed to go up when he made short but memorable appearance as sexy heroic pilot in Roland Emmerich's disaster epic 2012 (2009) and played journalist in fantasy TV-series Eastwick (2009) which brought him critical recognition. At the moment Johann has two romantic comedies in work.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTcxZTNmYzItN2RiMy00NTE1LTg4NjMtMjYyNzNjYzg1ZTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1053380","name":"Johann
