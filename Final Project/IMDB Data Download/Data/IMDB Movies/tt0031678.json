He remained unknown, traveling for several years and acting in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, until Fritz Lang cast him as the psychopathic child killer in M (1931). After several more films in Germany, Lorre left as the Nazis came to power, going to Paris, London and, in 1935, Hollywood. He played Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment (1935) and a series of Mr. Moto movies during the late 1930s. He began his pairing with Sydney Greenstreet as Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon (1941), continued in Casablanca (1942) and seven other films during the early 1940s. In Germany he wrote, directed and starred in L'homme perdu (1951). After that, somewhat heavier, he played in a string of not-so-stellar efforts, one exception being his role as a clown in The Big Circus (1959). He died the year he made his last movie, playing a stooge in Jerry Lewis' The Patsy (1964).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MzM0ODQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjYwNjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000048","name":"Peter Lorre","nicknames":["Lazzy","Europe's One Man Chamber of Horrors"],"idIMDB":"nm0000048"},"actorId":"nm0000048","character":"Mr. Moto","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0031266","main":true},{"actorName":"Ricardo Cortez","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007220","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzEwMTQwOTMyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxMDgxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1900","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Jacob Krantz","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Ricardo Cortez was born Jacob Krantz in New York City, New York, the son of Sarah (Lefkowitz) and Moses/Morris Krantz, Austrian Jewish immigrants who moved to NY just before he was born. His brother was cinematographer Stanley Cortez, who also changed his surname. Cortez worked a number of jobs while he trained as an actor. When Jacob arrived in Hollywood to work in movies in 1922, the Valentino mania was in full swing. Never shy about changing a name and a background, the studio transformed Jacob Krantz into Latin Lover Ricardo Cortez from Spain. Such was life in Hollywood. Starting with small parts, the tall, dark Cortez was being groomed by Paramount to be the successor to Rudolph Valentino. But Cortez would never be viewed (or consider himself) as the equal to the late Valentino. A popular star, he was saddled in a number of run-of-the-mill romantic movies which would depend more on his looks than on the script. Pictures like Argentine Love (1924) and The Cat's Pajamas (1926) did little to extend his range as an actor. He did show that he had some range with his role in Pony Express (1924), but roles like that were few and far between. With the advent of sound, Cortez made the transition and he would play Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon (1931) (aka Dangerous Female). Never a great actor, Cortez was cast as the smirking womanizer in a number of films and would soon slide down into 'B' movies. He played a newspaper columnist Is My Face Red? (1932), a home wrecker in A Lost Lady (1934), a killer in Man Hunt (1936) and even Perry Mason in The Case of the Black Cat (1936). After 1936, Cortez hit a lean patch for acting and tried his hand at directing. His career as a director ended after a half dozen movies and his screen career soon followed. He retired from the screen and returned to Wall Street, where he had worked as a runner decades before. This time, he returned as a member of one of Wall Street's top brokerage firms and lived a comfortable life.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzEwMTQwOTMyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxMDgxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007220","name":"Ricardo Cortez","idIMDB":"nm0007220"},"actorId":"nm0007220","character":"Fabian","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0491236","main":true},{"actorName":"Virginia Field","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276065","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0MGJjNjAtODAxOC00MzExLTkwNjgtN2NkNDY2NGJhNmE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 November 1917","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Margaret Cynthia St John Field","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"London-born actress, daughter of the King's Counsel, St. John Field, educated in Paris and Vienna.

A protégé and close friend of John Barrymore, Carradine was an extremely prolific film character actor while simultaneously maintaining a stage career in classic leading roles such as Hamlet and Malvolio.

Her mother was quite a famous piano player in the 1930s. Six-year-old Joan made her film debut in Walking Down Broadway (1938). She played the role of Sunny, and changed her name from Felt to Carroll. A role in Two Sisters (1938) followed, and the next year she had supporting roles in Barricade (1939) and Tower of London (1939). It wasn't until 1940 when Joan had her breakthrough. She had important parts in Anne of Windy Poplars (1940) and especially Primrose Path (1940), as Ginger Rogers' younger sister. In 1941, she won her first lead role in Obliging Young Lady (1942). She played Bridget Potter, who was stuck in the middle of a custody case but still found time to be the life of the party at a resort. The film costarred Ruth Warrick. In 1942, she was the first child star from Hollywood to appear in a Broadway play.This play, \"Panama Hattie\", garnered Carroll national fame, and she was featured in many magazine articles and newspapers. In 1943, she won her second lead role in Petticoat Larceny (1943), in which she played Joan Mitchell, a radio star who goes undercover to get a better feel of her roles. That film reunited Joan with Warrick. In 1944, she played Agnes, the middle sister between Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien in Meet Me in St. Louis (1944). In 1945, she had an important supporting role in The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), which starred Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman. That same year she appeared in Tomorrow, the World! (1944), after which she retired.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzM1ZTVmZDctMTZmNC00ZDQ0LWJlMTktY2VjYzc5NzJhOGUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzk3NTUwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140863","name":"Joan Carroll","idIMDB":"nm0140863"},"actorId":"nm0140863","character":"Mary Delacour","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Coote","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0178509","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 February 1909","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Robert Coote (1909-1982) was an English actor who had a thriving career for 50 years. He is best remembered for originating the role of Colonel Pickering in My Fair Lady (1964), Alan Jay Lerner & Frederick Loewe's musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (1938), for which he was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Featured Actor in a Musical in 1957. He also originated the role of King Pellinore in Lerner & Loewe's 1960 Broadway musical Camelot (1967). Coote played Colonel Pickering on Broadway and London, but Wilfrid Hyde-White was cast in the Oscar-winning 1964 movie despite Coote's extensive movie career. In fact, Coote had specialized in playing aristocrats and military men in countless films, most notably as Sergeant Bertie Higginbotham in George Stevens's 1939 classic Gunga Din (1939). (In real life, Coote served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War Two, becoming a squadron leader.) He possibly was overlooked for the movie (as was Julie Andrews, more notably) due to a strained relationship with star Rex Harrison, who stole business originated by Coote during the original Broadway production. Harrison resented Coote after unsuccessfully demanding to take over a famous piece of business created by Coote, Colonel Pickering's telephone call. Coote recreated the role in the 1976 Broadway revival.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0178509","name":"Robert Coote","idIMDB":"nm0178509"},"actorId":"nm0178509","character":"Rollo Venables","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Margaret Irving","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0410303","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMzZWZiMTAtZjNjNC00ZmI1LWFkZTQtOGNhYjIyZDljMjRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 January 1898","placeOfBirth":" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Margaret Irving was born on January 18, 1898 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.
