Torn attended Texas A & M and the University of Texas, where he majored in animal husbandry. Extremely naïf when he was young, Torn hitchhiked to Hollywood with the idea of becoming a movie star; he wanted to make enough money in order to buy a ranch. Success did not come overnight, as he had hoped, and Torn had to work many odd jobs while occasionally being cast in television roles. He made his feature film debut in Elia Kazan's Baby Doll (1956) in a small part. Serious about learning his craft, he moved to New York City where he studied under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Torn also studied dance with Martha Graham. His serious acting career began on the small screen, where he made a name for himself in the Golden Age of Television; between 1957 and 1960, he appeared regularly on such prestigious live shows as Omnibus (1952) and Playhouse 90 (1956). Torn made his Broadway debut in Kazan's staging of Tennessee Williams' \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" on March 10, 1959, in support of Paul Newman, Sidney Blackmer and Geraldine Page, who would become his second wife. The play was a hit, closing on January 30, 1960 after 375 performances. He won a 1960 Tony Award nomination as Best Featured Actor in a Play and a Theater World award for his role as \"Tom, Jr.\", a role he recreated in the 1962 film. (Torn also starred as \"Boss Finley\" in a later television adaptation of the play). Torn earned a reputation as an actor's actor on stage, both Broadway and off-Broadway, as well as on screen. He continues to work in the New York theater despite his demanding TV and movie schedule as both an actor and director. He has won two Obie awards for his work off-Broadway, for Distinguished Performance in Norman Mailer's \"The Deer Park\" (for the 1966-1967 season), and for Distinguished Direction for \"The Beard\" (1967-1968). He has his own stage company, and directed his daughter Angelica Page(by Geraldine Page) in John Paul Alexander's \"Strangers in the Land of Canaan\" at the Actors Studio. Torn made his feature film directorial debut with The Telephone (1988). He has constantly been in demand as a character actor, in supporting, second lead and occasional lead roles. His best performance on film came in Payday (1973), and he was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for Cross Creek (1983). Most of Torn's roles have been in drama, though he is adept in comedy. His role in Albert Brooks' comedy Defending Your Life (1991) led to his being cast in The Larry Sanders Show (1992), on which he played talk show producer \"Artie\". Torn won six consecutive Emmy nominations for the role, winning once for Best Supporting Actor in a comedy series in 1996. Rip Torn was married to actress Ann Wedgeworth from 1956 to 1961, whom he divorced to marry Geraldine Page. They remained married until her death in 1987. Torn helped his cousin, Oscar-winner Sissy Spacek, to make her way as an actress, seeing to it that she was accepted by the Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio and then the Lee Strasberg Institute.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTI5MTA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDE2Mjk2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001800","name":"Rip Torn","idIMDB":"nm0001800"},"actorId":"nm0001800","character":"Louis XV","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028916","main":true},{"actorName":"Rose Byrne","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126284","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4OTMxMDkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQxOTg3NQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 July 1979","placeOfBirth":" Balmain, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Mary Rose Byrne","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Rose Byrne was born in Balmain, Sydney, Australia.

She made her debut when she was only nine years old in Sergio Citti's Sogni e bisogni (1985). In 1988 she had the leading role in Cristina Comencini's first film, Zoo, l'appel de la nuit (1988), and was part of the cast of The Church (1989), directed by Michele Soavi. The following year she played Nanni Moretti's daughter in Palombella rossa (1989) (also directed by Moretti). It was with Close Friends (1992), written and directed by Michele Placido, that Asia's career really took off and she was able to move on from playing very young girls to more mature, complex roles. The movie was well-received at the Cannes International Film Festival. In Trauma (1993), she worked for the first time with her father, famed Italian horror director Dario Argento (her mother is one of Argento's favorite actresses, Daria Nicolodi, playing an anorexic girl in search of her parents' killer. The Phantom of the Opera (1998) is the third film she has made with her father, the others being Trauma (1993) (filmed in the US) and Le syndrome de Stendhal (1996). Asia's absorbed, intense style of acting was well-used in Giuseppe Piccioni's Condannato a nozze (1993). In 1993 she co-starred in Carlo Verdone's Perdiamoci di vista (1994) in which she played Arianna, a physically disabled girl--an intricate, difficult role that won her the David di Donatello for best actress (1993-1994). She also had a featured role in the international cast of Queen Margot (1994), directed by Patrice Chéreau. In 1995 she worked with Michel Piccoli in Peter Del Monte's Traveling Companion (1996), which again won her a David di Donatello and a Grolla d'oro. In 1994 Asia turned her hand to directing and turned out two short films: \"Prospettive\" (an episode of the film DeGenerazione (1994)) and \"A ritroso\". In 1996 she directed a documentary on her father and, in 1998, one on cult director Abel Ferrara, Abel/Asia (1998), which won an award at the Rome Film Festival. In 1999 Asia made her feature-directing debut with Scarlet Diva (2000), in which she was the leading actress and author of the screenplay. The film was released in May 2000 in Italy and the rest of the world. It won an award at the Williamsburg Film Festival in Brooklyn, New York.

No surprise for a man who was born into a legendary Hollywood family whose most noted members included his half-sister, his father, his grandfather, his nephew, and of course, himself. Born in Rome, Huston's parents were Zoe Sallis and John Huston. Sallis was an established author in her own right. John Huston was, by that point, famous for his many high caliber films, and notorious for his personal life, which included five marriages, two children, another adopted child, and many affairs, one of which resulted in Danny's conception. Like his half-sister, Anjelica Huston, Danny Huston chose to follow his father into the world of film. His birthright served as a blessing, so that his first film appearance as an actor was in The 'Human' Factor (1975), a revenge film directed by and starring men who already had Oscar nominations under their belts. Following that small appearance, Huston turned to directing for the next few years. It wasn't until the late 1980s that Huston directed his first made-for-television film, Mister Corbett's Ghost (1987). Based on a novella by Leon Garfied, the film starred such screen legends as Paul Scofield and Burgess Meredith. It is also notable for being the final acting project of Huston's father John, who spent his final years assisting his children in their own budding film careers. Shortly before his death, John helped produce his son's first feature length film, Mr. North (1988). The film was directed by Huston, and included his half-sister Anjelica in the cast, as well as Virginia Madsen, whom Huston would marry for a few years. Huston followed this up with the sexual drama Becoming Colette (1991), starring Klaus Maria Brandauer, and the horror film The Maddening (1995), starring Burt Reynolds. Neither film made a huge impact, and it was around this time, twenty years after his last acting role, that Huston returned to appearing in front of the camera. Starting modestly as a barman in the highly acclaimed Leaving Las Vegas (1995), Huston followed up with a supporting role in Anna Karenina (1997), alongside such would-be thespians as Sean Bean, Sophie Marceau, and Alfred Molina. The film was unfortunately a flop, as were Huston's next few film roles. In 2000, however, the tide finally turned, and Huston was able to break out as an established character actor. Re-uniting with his Anna Karenina director, Bernard Rose, Huston starred in the small-budget film Ivansxtc (2000), which was an adaptation of a book by Leo Tolstoy. While not a financial triumph, the film received very positive reactions from critics. The same fate awaited the film Hotel (2001), which included Huston in a diverse cast which included Lucy Liu, Rhys Ifans, Salma Hayek, and John Malkovich. It was also around this time that Huston met and married his second wife, Katie Jane Evans, though this marriage would end in great tragedy several years later. For now, though, Huston's career as an actor was just getting started. It was 21 Grams (2003) which secured Huston his first bona fide financial and critical success. Starring such names as Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro, the film follows a non-linear storyline dealing with the lives of several people who are affected by an automobile accident. Huston followed up this success by appearing in John Sayle's Silver City (2004), the controversial feature film Birth (2004), and Martin Scorsese's wildly successful film about Howard Hughes known as Aviator (2004). Nominated for many awards, the film was also a success financially. But nothing Huston had done up to this point would equal to what he did next. John Hillcoat's Australian western The Proposition (2005) is a very dark film set mostly in a small community in the Australian Outback during the 19th century. A criminal is dispatched by the local law enforcement to hunt down his older brother, Arthur Burns, and kill him. As played by Huston, Burns is a psychopath who cares nothing for the various rapes and murders that he has committed. He does, however, find some chasm of his heart to enjoy music, poetry, and the glorious beauty of the Australian sunsets. This layered performance as the film's villain arguably ranks as Huston's greatest performance to date. That same year, Huston played in the highly acclaimed film The Constant Gardener (2005), which tackled corruption, love, and humanitarian efforts by the West in Africa. Huston moved from Oscar-winning film to Oscar-winning film the following year with the films Marie Antoinette (2006) and Children of Men (2006). In the former, Huston portrays the Holy Roman Emperor, Joseph II, as a cautious and thoughtful monarch who warns Marie Antoinette of her excessive lifestyle. He proves to be prophetic when the French mobs storm the Bastille and launch a revolution. In the latter film, set in a dystopian world of global human infertility, Huston portrays Nigel, a government official who uses his position to preserve famous artwork. Both films were highly successful, and further cemented Huston as a noted actor. Huston proceeded to play Orson Welles in the thriller Fade to Black (2006), and also acted in the financially successful war film The Kingdom (2007) and the poorly received The Number 23 (2007). From this point onward, Huston would appear in many films, portraying characters of various importance. Among the more noted examples would be the superhero film X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), where Huston played the villainous role of William Stryker, the man who imprisons Wolverine and is responsible for his experimentation with adamantium. Huston also portrayed the Greek god Poseidon in Clash of the Titans (2010), as well as its sequel two years later. Whether the crime film Edge of Darkness (2010), the historical epic Robin Hood (2010), the biographical Hitchcock (2012), or the comedy 2 Jacks (2012) (which was another adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's work, again directed by Bernard Rose and also starred Huston's nephew Jack Huston ), Huston has constantly showed his range of accents, characters, and genres. More recently, Huston has continued to appear in films, including the upcoming Tim Burton -directed biopic Big Eyes (2014) and \"Frankenstein\", which will once again reunite him with Bernard Rose. Huston has also moved into the world of television with such series as \"Magic City\" (which earned him a Golden Globe nomination), \"American Horror Story\", and \"Masters of Sex\". As busy and talented as he always has been through nearly four decades of work in the film industry, Danny Huston continues to work as one of Hollywood's veteran character actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MTk4NDA0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ5NzIzNTk@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396812","name":"Danny Huston","idIMDB":"nm0396812"},"actorId":"nm0396812","character":"Emperor Joseph II","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005140","main":true},{"actorName":"Marianne Faithfull","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265717","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MDcxOTY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc2NTc1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 December 1946","placeOfBirth":" Hampstead, London, England, UK","birthName":"Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Daughter of Eva, the Baroness Erisso, and Major Glynn Faithfull, a WWII British spy.

Her parents were farmers, and after the death of her father, she left for Paris where she found work with a modeling agency. She quickly made a name for herself, preferring a natural style and refusing to wear make-up. In the seventies,Louis Malle, searching for a new face and look, discovered Aurore on the cover of the French magazine Elle and cast her in the role of France, a young Jewish woman in love with a collaborator in the controversial Lacombe, Lucien (1974). She then met Chantal Akerman and soon became one of her favorite comedians (from The Meetings of Anna (1978) in which she plays a lonely movie director traveling all over Europe, to Demain on déménage (2004) in which she portrays an intrusive and eccentric mother). In 1978 Aurore left for the Philippines to begin filming Apocalypse Now (1979), by Francis Ford Coppola, in which she was cast as the enigmatic and drug-addicted Roxanne who represented the typical 'femme fatale' for all French former colonists still dreaming of Indochina. However, the sequence, dubbed the 'Plantation', was unfortunately cut from the film and not seen again until the release of the Redux version in 2001. She met her husband, production designer Dean Tavoularis, while filming with Coppola. After several movies in Italy (Mario Monicelli, Dino Risi, Elio Petri) Aurore Clement was featured in two films shown in Cannes the same year. Portraying a loose woman for Claude Chabrol (The Hatter's Ghost (1982)) she totally reinvented herself and played a mysterious woman lost in the rain for Peter Del Monte \"L'invitation au Voyage\"). Two years later, she was cast by Wim Wenders as Dean Stockwell's wife in Paris, Texas (1984) which won the French Cannes Festival Palme d'Or. Excelling in playing both dramatic and lunatic characters, she reconnected with the 'cinéma d'auteur', notably in Anne-Marie Miéville's Nous sommes tous encore ici (1997) in which she played the wife of Jean Luc Godard; in Laetitia Masson's distressing world (For Sale (1998) , Only You (1994), La repentie (2002)), and in Serge Gainsbourg's nefarious and ultimate film, Stan the Flasher (1990). Aurore appeared also in well received and widely distributed movies such as Tanguy (2001), Bon voyage (2003), and Jet Set (2000) before being directed again by Claude Chabrol as a cute hairdresser (La demoiselle d'honneur (2004)) and by Sofia Coppola as the Duchess de Chartres in Marie Antoinette (2006). She has also been cast in numerous high quality films made for television such as Une péniche nommée 'Réalité' (1985) directed by Paul Seban (1982) in which she reconnects with her farming routes; Deux amies d'enfance (1983) with Ludmila Mikaël, directed by Nina Companeez (1983); \"Quidam\" (1984) in which director Gérard Marx casts her against type; Le regard dans le miroir (1985) directed by Jean Chapot (1985), in which she portrays a former camp survivor next to Bruno Cremer and Michel Bouquet; Les alsaciens - ou les deux Mathilde (1996), directed by Michel Favart, a film shown in two parts in which she plays a woman struggling and suffering throughout two world wars and \"Maigret et le corps sans tête\" (1991) in which she offers a stunning performance as a bar keeper in the mid-fifties rural France. She has also been recently seen in the series Zodiaque (2004) and Le maître du Zodiaque (2006). In addition to her film and television careers, Aurore has been a successful stage actress having first been seen in \"La Vie singulière d'Albert Nobbs\" (1988), directed by Simone Benmussa in which she portrays a young woman forced to disguise herself as a man in order to make a living in Victorian England. For this premiere on stage, she won an acting prize given by the French theater critics association. Ms. Clement was also seen in Anton Chekhov's \"La Mouette\", Marguerite Duras' \"Les Eaux et Forets\" and Alexandre Dumas fils' \"La Dame aux Camelias\", alongside Isabelle Adjani, for which she has been nominated for the Molieres (the equivalent of the American Tony's).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU3NDQ2MDYzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI5OTgwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167467","name":"Aurore Clément","idIMDB":"nm0167467"},"actorId":"nm0167467","character":"Duchesse de Char","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Guillaume Gallienne","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302916","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc4NDI1NzY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI1NTkyMTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 February 1972","placeOfBirth":" Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Guillaume Gallienne was born on February 8, 1972 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France.
