His father, named Carlos Luis de Funes de Galarza, was a former lawyer of Seville, Spain, who became a diamond cutter. His mother, named Leonor Soto Reguera, was of Spanish and Portugese extraction. Young Louis de Funès was fond of drawing and piano playing. He dropped out of school and worked various jobs, mostly as a jazz pianist at Pigalle, making his customers laugh every time he made a grimace. He studied acting for one year at the Simon acting school. There he made some useful contacts, including Daniel Gélin among others. During the occupation of Paris in the Second World War, he continued his piano studies at a music school, where he fell in love with a secretary, named Jeanne de Maupassant, a grand-niece of writer Guy de Maupassant. She had fallen in love with \"the young man who played jazz like god\"; they married in 1943, and had two sons born in 1944 and 1949. Funès continued playing piano at clubs, knowing there wasn't much call for a short, balding, skinny actor. His wife and Daniel Gelin encouraged him until he managed to overcome his rejection. He made his film debut in 1945, at the age of 31, and went on playing about one hundred film roles in the next twenty years. Louis de Funès shot to international fame in the 1960's after his roles in such slapstick comedies as 'Le gendarme de St. Tropez' (The Gendarme of St. Tropez 1964) and the Fantomas (1964) trilogy. He brilliantly portrayed a funny French policeman, whose hilarious hyperactivity, uncontrolled anger, and sardonic laughter produced a highly comic effect. Funès was voted the most favorite actor in France in 1968, and remained very popular in Europe during the 1970's. He also continued to play on stage during his career as a film star, and was acclaimed for his stage works in classic French theatre. Funès was instrumental in making film adaptations of such theatre plays as 'Oscar continues' and the Moliere's 'Le Misere', among other plays. Nicknamed \"the man with the forty faces per minute\", Louis de Funès played bit parts in over eighty films, before he got his first leading roles, eventually becoming the leading French comedian. He co-starred with the major French actors of the time, including Jean Marais and Mylène Demongeot in the Fantomas trilogy, and also Jean Gabin, Fernandel, Bourvil, Coluche, Annie Girardot, and Yves Montand. Funès's collaboration with director 'Gerard Oury' produced a memorable tandem of Funès-Bourvil. He also worked with Jean Girault in the famous 'Gendarmes' series. In a departure from the Gendarme image, Funès collaborated with Claude Zidi, who wrote for him a new character full of nuances and frankness in L'aile ou la cuisse (1976), which is arguably the best of his roles. Funès played over 130 roles in film and over 100 roles on stage. From 1943-1983 Louis de Funès was married to Jeanne Barthelemy de Maupassant. Their son, named 'Olivier De Funes' , had a brief acting career before becoming a pilot with Air France, his other son, named Patric de Funes, became a medical doctor. Louis de Funès was also a rose grower, a variety of roses has been named the \"Louis de Funès rose\" after him. He died of a heart attack and complications of a stroke on January 27, 1983, in Nantes, France. He was laid to rest in the Cimetière du Cellier, and a monument of him was erected in the rose-garden of his wife's castle.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc5NTkyMDU4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk0NTM1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000086","name":"Louis de Funès","nicknames":["Fufu"],"idIMDB":"nm0000086"},"actorId":"nm0000086","character":"Maréchal des logis-chef Ludovic Cruchot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0021286","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean Lefebvre","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498876","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxMjA4NzI3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NTM1NTE@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 October 1919","placeOfBirth":" Valenciennes, Nord, France","birthName":"Jean Marcel Lefebvre","bio":"Jean Lefebvre was born on October 3, 1919 in Valenciennes, Nord, France as Jean Marcel Lefebvre.

And charm them he did, in real life, on the stage, on the big and little screen, for nearly fifty years. Born in France in 1921, he was raised and spent his youth in Algeria. Both a sporty type and literature enthusiast, this multi-talented man excelled at water-polo (he was a champion water-polo player in the R.U.A. team), was a good tennis player and a passable horse rider but his love for books finally led him to Radio-Alger where he started his acting career as a member of the channel's acting company. He was also an occasional announcer there. During World War II he was called up to work on the \"Camp des Chênes\" Youth Camp. And in 1944 he made his first movie in Cairo with his mother as partner. After the war, he debuted in France as a leading man, his good looks and his fine presence boosting his career from the start. He could be a professional knife-thrower (in Pierre Chenal's curious \"La Foire aux Chimères\", with Erich Von Stroheim),a doctor (in \"La Maternelle\") or a drug trafficker (in \"Méfiez-vous des Blondes\", Hunebelle's amusing noir spoof) with equal ease. The trouble is that too many of the movies he was in are now old-fashioned (the worst being \"Capitaine Ardant\", in which he plays a valiant French officer fighting back against \"nasty native rebels\") and have been forgotten. So that, after a quick start, Yves Vincent got fewer and fewer roles.In the late sixties and early seventies, for instance, he was reduced to play second fiddle to Louis de Funès in three of his films or to appear in two cheesy soft porn flicks concocted by the king of the genre, Max Pécas. He was luckier at the theater where he appeared - among other plays - alongside Arletty in the French adaptation of Tennessee Williams' \"A streetcar named Desire\"(Un tramway nommé Désir) and with Edwige Feuillère in \"La Dame aux Camélias\". He has also done a lot of work on television where he often embodied figures of authority. Yves Vincent retired in 1991.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898789","name":"Yves Vincent","idIMDB":"nm0898789"},"actorId":"nm0898789","character":"Le colonel de gendarmerie examinateur","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0021292","main":true},{"actorName":"Christian Marin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0547440","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 February 1929","placeOfBirth":" Lyon, Rhône, France","bio":"Christian Marin was born on February 8, 1929 in Lyon, Rhône, France.
