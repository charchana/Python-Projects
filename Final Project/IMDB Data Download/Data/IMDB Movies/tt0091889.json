One of her first noticed performances was in the stage cabaret show \"Byens bedste bryster\" in the mid-eighties, a show which has been continued in several new versions since then. As a director for the stage she has won acclaim for the Danish version of the popular play \"The Vagina Monologues\" (2001). Her latest project is 2004's play based on Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\" at Århus Teater. She has also taught theatre classes at Statens Teaterskole, Denmark. It is fair to say, though, that Peüliche's widest audiences were reached in her acting roles in film and television, especially her comedic part as one of the elves in Nissebanden (1984) and Nissebanden i Grønland (1989).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0679284","name":"Kirsten Peüliche","idIMDB":"nm0679284"},"actorId":"nm0679284","character":"Dolphin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Berthe Qvistgaard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0704585","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 August 1910","placeOfBirth":" Denmark","bio":"Berthe Qvistgaard was born on August 11, 1910 in Denmark.

Ernst had his debut playing Chino in Westside Story (1965). In 1969 he jumped from Odense Teater to Det Kongelige Teater where he continued stage-acting until 1976. Ernst performed in a lot of classic stage-plays such as Jeppe På Bjerget, Erasmus Montanus, Hamlet and Amadeus. In 1973, Ernst played the lead role in Hans Kristensen's gangster-movie Flugten which was followed by the two sequels Per (1975) and Blind Makker (1976). The three films became very popular, and are to this day still considered some of the best Danish films ever. Kristensen's Per-trilogy launched Ole Ernst's career as one of the finest actors of his generation. A short list of other great films Ernst starred in: Hærværk (1977), Terror (1977), Mord I Mørket (1986), Peter von Scholten (1987), Epidemic (1987), Sort Høst (1993), Okay (2002) and Rembrandt (2004).
