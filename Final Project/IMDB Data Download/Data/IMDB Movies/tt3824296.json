She was raised in New York, and took her stepfather's surname. Roberts was a 20-year veteran of the Broadway stage before she began appearing steadily in character roles in film and on television during the 1970s. A versatile player with an inescapably \"mom-like\" presence, she was adept at playing sympathetic roles but made her most memorable mark as hard-boiled dames, gossips, and nags who were often too savvy of the ways of the world to be fooled by anyone. Roberts built up some face recognition with regular appearances in the sitcoms \"Mary Hartman Mary Hartman\" (syndicated, 1976-77) and \"Angie\" (ABC, 1979-1980) but truly came into her own as a widely known comedienne in 1995 when she was cast as the meddling, strong-willed family matriarch on \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" (CBS, 1996-2005). The show became of the best-loved sitcoms in history, and Roberts earned seven Emmy nominations and four wins for her colorful characterization. Well past the common age of retirement and well past the show's celebrated end, Roberts maintained a reputation as one of the big and small screen's most iconic mothers, and she continued to be a welcome sight as a television guest star and film player.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDgxMDYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDUxNzc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005368","name":"Doris Roberts","idIMDB":"nm0005368"},"actorId":"nm0005368","character":"Norma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rachael Carpani","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139257","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5OTg1OTEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkwNDY1NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 August 1980","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Rachael Ann Carpani","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Rachael has an Italian father, Tony, and an Australian mother, Gael, and grew up on a property near Dural, in Sydney's Hills district She joined an acting agent and was happy to get bit parts in television shows and commercials, but never took acting seriously. Coming from an academic family, school work was always first. She studied drama in her final year of high school and her marks placed her in the top 10 per cent in NSW. She enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts, Media and Cultural Studies degree and also took performance studies, majoring in writing. She deferred her last year of university to work on McLeod's Daughters (2001), but hoped to return to do honors in film studies at some point. When offered the part of Jodi Fountain on McLeod's Daughters (2001), her first reaction was, \"Are you sure you've got the right person?\" She said it was \"total excitement\" to find out Sonia Todd would be playing her mother, Meg.

After a short stint in the Marine Corps, he moved to Detroit where he became the resident playwright at Concept East, the oldest black theatre in the country. In addition, he enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills and found time to establish the Actors' Emsemble Theatre, where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. After graduating with a B.A. from Wayne State, he was rewarded a full scholarship to the M.F.A. program at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. While performing with the school's repertory company, he was asked to appear in the Los Angeles production of Lonne Elder III's musical \"Daddy Goodness,\" which led to his meeting Gordon Parks, who gave Hudson the costarring role in his first feature film, Leadbelly (1976). Unfortunately, all that followed \"Leadbelly\" was a year of \"bit parts and some harsh lessons about Hollywood,\" which led Hudson to enroll in another academic doctorate program at the University of Minnesota. He did not complete the program. Through his experience, he learned another vital lesson: \"There are those who spend their lives studying it and those who spend their lives doing it.\" Hudson definitely wanted to be in the second group. Keeping in mind this self-revelation, Hudson accepted the starring role of Jack Jefferson in the Minneapolis Theatre In The Round's production of \"The Great White Hope,\" a role that he put \"everything he had into,\" including shaving his head. A series of starring and guest roles followed on such television shows as Fantasy Island (1977), The Incredible Hulk (1978), Little House on the Prairie (1974), Diff'rent Strokes (1978), Taxi (1978), One Day at a Time (1975), Gimme a Break! (1981), The A-Team (1983) and Webster (1983), as well as costarring roles in the TV movies White Mama (1980) with Bette Davis, Roots: The Next Generations (1979), Women of San Quentin (1983), California Girls (1985), Mad Bull (1977) and Love on the Run (1985). Other feature film credits include The Jazz Singer (1980), The Main Event (1979), Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983), Penitentiary II (1982), Going Berserk (1983), Joy of Sex (1984) and, of course, the mega-hit Ghostbusters (1984).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1ODMxNTc0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwODI2OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001368","name":"Ernie Hudson","idIMDB":"nm0001368"},"actorId":"nm0001368","character":"Dr. Beck","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elizabeth Bond","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1410077","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY1NTQyMDA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDUzMDcxMzE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Elizabeth Bond is an actress and producer, known for The Notebook (2004), Grey's Anatomy (2005) and The A-List (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY1NTQyMDA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDUzMDcxMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1410077","name":"Elizabeth Bond","idIMDB":"nm1410077"},"actorId":"nm1410077","character":"Amber Fells","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Gartin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0308651","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNjg4MTg0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYwMjMxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 January 1968","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Christopher Russell Gartin","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Chris Gartin was born on January 12, 1968 in New York City, New York, USA as Christopher Russell Gartin.
