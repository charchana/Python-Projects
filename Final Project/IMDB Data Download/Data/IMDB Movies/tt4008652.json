On the contrary, both brothers were as close as two brothers could be. Born Rudolph Valentino Clay, he was two years older than his brother, Cassius Marcellous Clay. Both brothers became involved in the amateur boxing program in Louisville after young Cassius got his bike stolen. Rahman excelled in boxing as did his brother. When it came time to attempt to get on the 1960 Olympic team, Cassius fought in the 175 pound Division, so that his brother could have a chance at the Heavyweight bracket. History will tell you that Cassius went on to the Olympics, while Rudolph did not. After some 100 amateur fights, Rudy (his nickname) turned professional on February 25, 1964, the night his brother defeated Sonny Liston for the World's Heavyweight Title. Rahman became a Black Muslim first and is said to have introduced his brother to the ministry. Both men changed their names to Muslim names. Rahaman would remain undefeated for the next 6 years. However, in 1972 after back-to-back losses to Roy Dean Wallace and Jack O'Halloran, he retired from boxing. Rahaman's record was 13-3-1 with 6 knockouts. He remains close to his brother and both men have boxed countless exhibitions throughout the years.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzEzNjc3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA3Mzk3MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019475","name":"Rahman Ali","nicknames":["Rudy Clay"],"idIMDB":"nm0019475"},"actorId":"nm0019475","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jim Brown","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000987","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MDUzNDU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg3MTI0NA@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1936","placeOfBirth":" St. Simons Island, Georgia, USA","birthName":"James Nathaniel Brown","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Often mentioned as the greatest player in NFL history, this ruggedly handsome African American fullback for the Cleveland Browns first appeared on movie screens in the western Rio Conchos (1964), followed by a strong supporting role as convict commando \"Jefferson\" in the terrific WW2 action film The Dirty Dozen (1967). He was kept busy with additional on screen appearances in other fast paced films including Ice Station Zebra (1968), 100 Rifles (1969) and El Condor (1970). Brown's popularity grew during the boom of \"blaxploitation\" cinema in the early 1970s portraying tough \"no nonsense\" characters in Slaughter (1972), Black Gunn (1972) and Three the Hard Way (1974). His on-screen work in the latter part of the 1970s and 1980s was primarily centered around guest spots on popular TV shows such as CHiPs (1977) and Knight Rider (1982). However, Brown then resurfaced in better quality films beginning with his role as a fiery assassin in The Running Man (1987), he parodied the blaxploitation genre along with many other African-American actors in the comedy I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (1988), played an ex-heavyweight boxer in the sci-fi comedy Mars Attacks! (1996) and ironically played an ex-football legend in the Oliver Stone directed sports film Any Given Sunday (1999). Additionally, Jim Brown was a ringside commentator for the first six events of the Ultimate Fighting Championships from 1993 through to 1996. A bona fide legend in American sports and a successful actor, he continues to remain busy in front of the camera with recent appearances in various sports shows & TV productions.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MDUzNDU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg3MTI0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000987","name":"Jim Brown","idIMDB":"nm0000987"},"actorId":"nm0000987","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Carl Fischer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6745986","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Carl Fischer yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6745986","name":"Carl Fischer","idIMDB":"nm6745986"},"actorId":"nm6745986","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"George Foreman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0286040","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTQ0NzAwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTE2NTc0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 January 1949","placeOfBirth":" Marshall, Texas, USA","birthName":"George Edward Foreman","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"George Foreman was boxing's most feared fighter from 1973-1974. Undefeated in 40 straight fights, 37 by knockout, he was on a 24 consecutive knockout run when he faced Muhammad Ali on October 30, 1974 in defense of his world heavyweight title in Zaire, Africa. A product of a poor family, Foreman was in constant trouble with the law. He credits the Job Corp with turning his life around. Started boxing as an amateur and, in less than three years, captured a gold medal in the 1968 Olympic Games. Lost only 2 out of 24 amateur fights. Turned pro under the guidance of veteran trainer Dick Saddler. Foreman was a stablemate of former heavyweight king Charles \"Sonny\" Liston and Charlie Snips. Foreman idolized Liston and copied his ring style and mannerisms. Foreman used a piercing stare to intimated his opponents ala Liston. He was criticized for beating second rate opponents, yet had scored victories over credible fighters like George Chuvallo, Boone Kirkman and Gregorio Peralta. Destroyed undefeated Joe Frazier in two brutal rounds to capture the world title in 1973; Frazier was knocked down six times. Destroyed Jose \"King\" Roman in one round and Ken Norton in two rounds to retain his title. Foreman was knocked out by 3-1 underdog Muhammad Ali in 8 rounds. Foreman fought 5 men in one night in a 1975 exhibition. Won five straight knockouts on the comeback trail before being decked and decision-ed by Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico in 1977. Foreman claimed to have seen God in his dressing room following the defeat and announced he was going to become a preacher and retire from boxing. Preached for 10 years and blew up to 300 pounds. Decided to return to the ring to raise money for his church; experts laughed, but Foreman racked up 18 straight knockout victories. He was defeated in a title bid by Evander Holyfield but, a few years later, shocked the world by knocking out undefeated World Heavyweight Champion Michael Moorer (36-0) to become champion again at 45. Made a few successful defenses before losing his title by a controversial decision to Shannon Briggs.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTQ0NzAwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTE2NTc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0286040","name":"George Foreman","nicknames":["Big George","The Heywood Giant"],"idIMDB":"nm0286040"},"actorId":"nm0286040","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marvis Frazier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1733519","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 September 1960","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Marvis Kirk Frazier","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Marvis Frazier was born on September 10, 1960 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA as Marvis Kirk Frazier.

Left school at 16 and was married, having a son a year later. He brought in money for his family from an assortment of jobs, singing in pubs at night. By 1963, he was playing regularly with his own group in the demanding atmosphere of working mens clubs. Gordon Mills, a performer who had branched out into songwriting and management went to see him. He became his manager and landed him a record contract in 1964. They made a great team and had huge international success with their second single, a song penned by Mr Mills -- \"It's Not Unusual.\" An avalanche of gold singles and albums followed. Mr Jones, a vocal powerhouse, has sustained his popularity for over three decades, and his recordings have spanned the spectrum of musical styles.
