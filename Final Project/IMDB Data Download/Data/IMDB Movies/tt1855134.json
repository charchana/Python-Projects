He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, \"The Goon Show,\" starring the legendary Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, and Harry Secombe. Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university's legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python Graham Chapman. Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name \"Cambridge Circus.\" When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met Terry Gilliam, another future Python. Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\", based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in At Last the 1948 Show (1967), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included The Frost Report (1966) and Marty Feldman's program Marty (1968). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day. After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Life of Brian (1979), Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982), and The Meaning of Life (1983). Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth collaborated in the legendary television series Fawlty Towers (1975), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day. Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy A Fish Called Wanda (1988), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with The World Is Not Enough (1999), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials. Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese's other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with Connie Booth and a daughter with his second wife, Barbara Trentham. Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MTIzMzM1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQ3ODI1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000092","name":"John Cleese","nicknames":["Cleesey"],"idIMDB":"nm0000092"},"actorId":"nm0000092","character":"The Narrator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Munro Chambers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1089325","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUxNDM5OTQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI2NzE1NDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 July 1990","placeOfBirth":" Ajax, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Munro Skylear Chambers","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Munro Chambers was born on July 29, 1990 in Ajax, Ontario, Canada.

After his parents divorced, he was raised by his father. In 1983, he got his first taste of stand-up comedy when he performed at open microphone nights at the University of Iowa. Tom's comedy career had its ups and downs over the next several years until 1988, when he entered the Minneapolis Comedy Competition and won first place. With this victory in hand, he decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue a stand-up comedy career. Once he hit Los Angeles, things happened fast. That same year, he was hired as a staff writer for Roseanne Barr's TV sitcom Roseanne (1988) and began to appear regularly on the show as \"Arnie Thomas\". He and Roseanne Barr were married in 1990, with Arnold converting to Judaism prior to the marriage. They formed Rapello County Productions to develop projects for themselves. The couple's marriage, together with their sometimes outrageous behavior, attracted media attention - and especially that of the tabloids - like a magnet. In 1994 conditions between the two deteriorated and they went through a very public, and acrimonious, divorce. Tom has been married twice since then and is the co-host of Fox Sports Net's talk show The Best Damn Sports Show Period (2001). He also does voiceover work, and provides the voice for the \"Oven Mitt\" character in the TV commercials for the Arby's restaurant chain.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NTYzNzMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc2NzgzMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000792","name":"Tom Arnold","idIMDB":"nm0000792"},"actorId":"nm0000792","character":"Beethoven","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0271384","main":true},{"actorName":"Tamra Ugto","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4126117","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tamra Ugto is an actress, known for Beethoven's Christmas Adventure (2011), Verdict (2012) and Tutulungan Kita - I'll Help You (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4126117","name":"Tamra Ugto","idIMDB":"nm4126117"},"actorId":"nm4126117","character":"Mom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0423260","main":true},{"actorName":"Alan Castanaga","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3647084","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Alan Castanaga is known for his work on My Awkward Sexual Adventure (2012), Beethoven's Christmas Adventure (2011) and Steel (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3647084","name":"Alan Castanaga","idIMDB":"nm3647084"},"actorId":"nm3647084","character":"Dad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0423262","main":true},{"actorName":"Salty MacPherson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4384018","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Salty MacPherson is an actor, known for Beethoven's Christmas Adventure (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4384018","name":"Salty MacPherson","idIMDB":"nm4384018"},"actorId":"nm4384018","character":"Little Kid","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0423266","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1855134","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1855134","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 30 min (90 min) (Argentina)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["16:9 HD"],"camera":["Arri Alexa"],"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.6","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"}],"rated":"PG","awards":[{"award":"ACTRA Awards 2012","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated ACTRA Award of Excellence","categories":[{"category":"Best Performance for a Male Artist (Manitoba)","names":[{"name":"Ryan Miller","id":"nm4383217","role":"actor"}]}]}]},{"award":"Motion Picture Sound Editors, USA 2012","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Golden Reel Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Sound Editing - Direct to Video - Live Action","names":[{"name":"Patrick Giraudi","id":"nm0320816","role":"supervising sound editor"},{"name":"Michael T.
