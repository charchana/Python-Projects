He was inevitably brought back home, but he made good his second escape a few years later - his willful Knowles Yorkshire origin would not be denied. What stage experience he had amounted to a few seasons in regional theater, but he started in British sound films early (1932), calling himself Patric Knowles. He was the proverbial tall, dark and handsome type and headed for romantic lead roles. He rose slowly rose up the ranks of featured players in an array of 14 British films that included one of director Michael Powell's early successes, The Girl in the Crowd (1935). The last of his British efforts was Crown v. Stevens (1936) which, being a British Warner Bros. production, was scouted for the studio's Hollywood home base. This and a few previous films that year were lead vehicles for Knowles, and for this last he was recommended for a Hollywood contract. His first American effort was the big-screen soap opera Give Me Your Heart (1936) with notable Warner players, in which he played a noble cad. His chance for a more romantic introduction came later in the year with The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), where he joined an already popular new Angle face, Errol Flynn. Knowles played his younger brother in this well received bit of revisionist historical drama. Through the remainder of the 1930s Knowles had a few leads with second-tier featured stars, but more often he was second lead as strait-laced but engaging in comedies as well as dramas. There were other films with Flynn, most notably the classic The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) in which he played Will Scarlett (in bright red jerkin). Knowles was a licensed private pilot and during free time provided some white-knuckle moments for Flynn, whose on-screen derring-do cloaked several phobias including vertigo. Knowles preferred freelancing to the confinement of long contract associations--one means of dodging the pitfall of being typecast. He was at RKO to play - with great verve - the shallow and rich playboy on the ill-fated plane of Five Came Back (1939). At Twentieth Century-Fox he played - very effectively - one of the big brothers of the Morgan family in the classic How Green Was My Valley (1941). Of course, freelancing could also lead to typecasting. Knowles parked himself at Universal in 1943, condemned to play clean-up hero in its formula horror films, such as The Wolf Man (1941) and the less engaging Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943). He also had to endure straight man duty to the insipid antics of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, among other indignities suffered as a utility player at Universal. He continued through the 1940s to 1951 with a mix of capable first and second lead roles with other studios, but that somewhat bored and deepening grimness on his face perhaps reflected frustration with typecast characters, as well as the realization that big fame would never come his way. He continued to be game, though, and fairly leaped at the new live playhouse theater phenomenon of early television. Along with one or two movies a year, he worked in this pioneering small screen theater starting in 1951. He also embraced episodic TV and made the rounds of the popular western and private eye shows of the period. Big- and small-screen work gradually tapered off for him through the 1960s. In the late part of the decade he was playing dignified military officers, such as Lord Mountbatten in the hit The Devil's Brigade (1968). He spent time doing college lecturing, commercials, and wrote a novel called \"Even Steven.\" Retiring to the north end of the San Fernando Valley in Woodland Hills, Knowles was close to the Motion Picture Country Home in Calabasas, where he spent much time volunteering to help with the various functions provided for the many elderly show business people, many of whom had not been as fortunate as Knowles to have graced nearly 125 film efforts.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NjYzOTA2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwODExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461549","name":"Patric Knowles","nicknames":["Pat"],"idIMDB":"nm0461549"},"actorId":"nm0461549","character":"Max Brandt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"W.H.

Istvan Gyergyay was born in the old Austro/Hungarian town of Ungvar (present-day Uzhgorod) and studied at Budapest University. His acting career began on stage with the Hungarian National Theatre in 1924. By the end of the decade, he appeared in Hungarian films (one of them, Tokajerglut (1933), starred the Hungarian actor, and future Hollywood favourite, S.Z. Sakall). In 1934, Istvan moved to Britain and became first 'Stefan', then 'Steven'. In spite of initial linguistic problems, he soon managed to secure steady work on screen and in radio. Seven years later, he turned up in Hollywood and soon found himself much in demand for playing waiters, maitre d's, stewards, doctors and the occasional ship captain. He was a useful little actor to back up the exotic locales stipulated for films like The Mask of Dimitrios (1944). He also gave valuable support in pictures with military or espionage themes, from Hotel Berlin (1945) to Gilda (1946) (as the casino's washroom attendant, Uncle Pio, whose actions in the final scene are crucial in removing the chief encumbrance to a happy ending). In The Moon and Sixpence (1942), he effectively essayed the buffoonish painter Dirk Stroeve, though Bosley Crowther of the New York Times (October 28, 1942) found his performance \"inclined to affectation\". Under contract at Columbia from 1946 to 1952, Steven even featured in a rare starring role in the cult film noir So Dark the Night (1946). From the mid-1950's, Steven worked almost exclusively as a reliable TV guest actor and was somewhat unfortunate to round off his career as Dr. Frankenstein's grandson Rudolph out in the Wild West of William Beaudine's low budget exploitation flick Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter (1966).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFlNGVjYTctYWIwOC00ODM1LTliZTAtN2RhOTI3NzQzNmMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0314065","name":"Steven Geray","idIMDB":"nm0314065"},"actorId":"nm0314065","character":"Mickey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hugh Dempster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0218787","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 August 1900","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Hugh Dempster was born on August 3, 1900 in London, England.

A piano prodigy, she studied in Paris and appeared in concert in England during her teenage years. Acting, however, became her career of choice, studying at the Guildhall School of Music. She took her very first stage bow in a production of Peter Pan. In the adult role of Mrs. Darling, she was actually younger than the actors playing her children. In years to come, Norma would play a number of mature, lady-like roles that were much older than she was. She performed Shakespeare in repertory and was at first cast in dramatic plays such as The Wandering Jew (1920-her West End debut) and Hamlet (1925) as the Player Queen. In various acting companies, she eventually found a flair for comedy and became the resident character comedienne for the famous Aldwych Theatre farce-ers from 1929 to 1933 à la Marx Bros. foil Margaret Dumont. Finding success there in the comedies A Night Like This and Turkey Time, she later recreated both roles on British film a couple of years later. She went on to prove herself a minor but avid scene-stealer in such movies as Evergreen (1934), The Iron Duke (1934), Stormy Weather (1935) and East Meets West (1936), quickly finding an amusing niche as a haughty society maven. She played both benevolent and supercilious with equal ease -- her height (5'7-1/2\"), elongated oval face, vacant manner, plummy voice and slightly drowsy eyes adding immensely to the look and amusement of her characters. In the early 1940s, the veteran actress visited California, accompanied by her ailing, widowed mother, for a take on the warmer climate and decided to permanently settle. Again, she found herself in demand as a now silvery-haired duchess, queen or Lady something, albeit in less meaty, sometimes even unbilled parts. Although she could dress down when called upon as a bar maid, nurse and landlady, she usually was asked to provide the requisite atmosphere for glossy, opulent settings. Her more noticeable roles came as lecherous Robert Benchley's wealthy, put-upon wife in The Major and the Minor (1942); the vile Lady Abbott in Forever Amber (1947); the giddy socialite nearly strangled by Robert Walker in Hitchcock's classic Strangers on a Train (1951); the impressively bejeweled wife of Charles Coburn who Marilyn Monroe fawns over in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953); and the Von Trapp housekeeper Frau Schmidt in The Sound of Music (1965). Norma became a steadfast radio and TV comedy foil during the 40s, 50s and 60s, often at the mercy of a Lucille Ball or Jack Benny. Her longest radio part was as Basil Rathbone's housekeeper on his Sherlock Holmes radio series. On TV, she appeared in such shows as Mister Ed (1958), The Beverly Hillbillies (1962), Bewitched (1964) and Batman (1966) She had recurring roles as Betty Hutton's aunt on The Betty Hutton Show (1959) and as Shirley Booth's neighbor on Hazel (1961). Never married, Norma's mother passed away in 1969, and the actress retired shortly after. She died of heart failure in 1989, a day before her 91st birthday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNTExNTI4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk0MzAyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889540","name":"Norma Varden","idIMDB":"nm0889540"},"actorId":"nm0889540","character":"Dora Streudelmeier, Karl's Aunt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wallace Lupino","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0526951","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 January 1898","placeOfBirth":" Edinburgh, Scotland, UK","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Wallace Lupino was born on January 23, 1898 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
