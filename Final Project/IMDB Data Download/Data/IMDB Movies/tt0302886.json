The son of Laura (Cunningham), a photographer, and Robert Andrew Wilson, an advertising executive, he was raised with two brothers, Owen Wilson (the middle one) and Andrew Wilson (the eldest one). The three would all go on to make their careers in film, with Luke Wilson discovering his love of acting while a student at Occidental College. In 1993, the brothers Wilson collaborated with Wes Anderson to make Bottle Rocket (1994), which was initially a 13-minute short. The gleefully optimistic story of three Texans who aspire to become successful thieves, Bottle Rocket (1994) premiered at the 1993 Sundance Festival, where it attracted the attention of director James L. Brooks. With Brooks' help, the short became a full-length feature film released in 1996 under the same name, Bottle Rocket (1996). Afterwards, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson and the same year, Wilson also appeared in the coming-of-age drama Telling Lies in America (1997). After large roles in three 1998 comedies, Best Men (1997), Bongwater (1998), and Home Fries (1998) (the latter two co-starring Drew Barrymore), Wilson went on to star in another three comedies the following year. The first, Dog Park (1998), was a Canadian film directed by The Kids in the Hall (1988) alum Bruce McCulloch and featured Wilson as one of a group of twenty-something's undergoing the trials and tribulations of love. Blue Streak (1999) starred the actor as the sidekick of robber-turned-policeman Martin Lawrence, while Kill the Man (1999) (which premiered at the 1999 Sundance Festival) cast him as the owner of a small copy centre competing with a large chain store across the street. Though he would stick closely to comedy through 2001 with roles in Charlie's Angels (2000) and Legally Blonde (2001), Wilson took a turn for the sinister in the thrillers Bad Seed (2000) and Soul Survivors (2001) before reteaming with his brother Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson to give one of his most memorable performances as Richie in The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). In 2003, Wilson reprised two past roles, appearing in both Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde (2003). That same year, he also scored a hit as one of the stars of Todd Phillips' Old School (2003). The year 2004 saw Wilson embark on The Wendell Baker Story (2005), a film he starred in, co-directed with brother Andrew Wilson. Although he made his film debut in the acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket (1996), he initially got more recognition for his real-life role as Drew Barrymore's boyfriend than for his acting. Fortunately for Wilson, his onscreen talents outlasted his relationship with Barrymore, and he has enjoyed steady employment and increasing visibility through substantial roles in a number of films","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3MjYxNDk4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ5OTQzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005561","name":"Luke Wilson","nicknames":["One-Take Wilson"],"idIMDB":"nm0005561"},"actorId":"nm0005561","character":"Mitch","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009008","main":true},{"actorName":"Will Ferrell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002071","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDIzMDEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcxMjE2Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 July 1967","placeOfBirth":" Irvine, California, USA","birthName":"John William Ferrell","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"John William Ferrell was born in Irvine, California, to Betty Kay (Overman), a teacher, and Roy Lee Ferrell, Jr., a musician. His parents were both originally from Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. A graduate of the University of Southern California, Ferrell became interested in performing while a student at University High School in Irvine, where he made his school's daily morning announcements over the public address system in disguised voices. He started as a member of the Los Angeles comedy/improvisation group The Groundlings, where fellow cast members Ana Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and former Saturday Night Live (1975) repertory players such as Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman began their careers. It was there he met Chris Kattan and the two became good friends and both went on to Saturday Night Live (1975) later. He has also appeared on several television programs, including Strangers with Candy (1999), Grace Under Fire (1993) and Living Single (1993) during his time at The Groundlings. Will also lent his voice to the armless and legless dad of cartoon family \"The Oblongs\". In 1995 he became a feature cast member at Saturday Night Live (1975) during the show's rapid re-casting. He was declared quite possibly the worst cast member ever during his first season. However, his talents of impersonations and range of characters shot him forward to making him arguably the greatest Saturday Night Live (1975) cast member ever. During his seven year run he is one of the few cast members to ever be nominated for an Emmy for a performance and played George W. Bush during the 2000 elections. He's appeared in every Saturday Night Live (1975) movie since his premiere on the show in 1995. In 2002 he left Saturday Night Live (1975) and was the only cast member to ever receive a farewell from all the current cast members at the end of the season finale show.

Vince was interested in theater early on and grabbed a spot in a Chevy commercial. In 1988 he moved to Hollywood. He managed to hit a few spots on television, but his real goal was to make it to the big screen. He made his first credited role in the film Rudy (1993) where he met his friend Jon Favreau, who was writing a script detailing his life as an out-of-work actor. Vince was written into Swingers (1996) by Jon to play the character of \"Trent\". He signed on just as a favor to his buddy, not realizing it would be a career changing role. Though not a commercial success, it was a critical success in which Steven Spielberg saw him and cast him in the big budget sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). This role gave Vince the exposure he needed to become a movie star and, for the first time, choose the roles he wanted to take. A Cool, Dry Place (1998) put him as a loving father, Return to Paradise (1998) cast him as a man having to make a life or death decision to save a friend, and Clay Pigeons (1998) cast him as an interesting serial killer. Since then his roles have been primarily in comedies such as Old School (2003), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), Wedding Crashers (2005), and Couples Retreat (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDA0MzE0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUzOTI4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681","name":"Vince Vaughn","nicknames":["Mr Sunshine"],"idIMDB":"nm0000681"},"actorId":"nm0000681","character":"Beanie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009010","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeremy Piven","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005315","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ0NjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1NzMxNQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 July 1965","placeOfBirth":" Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Jeremy Samuel Piven","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Born in Manhattan and raised in Evanston, Illinois, he is an alumnus of the Piven Theatre Workshop founded by his parents (Byrne Piven and Joyce Hiller Piven) and a one time Chicago stage actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ0NjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1NzMxNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005315","name":"Jeremy Piven","nicknames":["Jez Piv","The Piv"],"idIMDB":"nm0005315"},"actorId":"nm0005315","character":"Pritchard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009004","main":true},{"actorName":"Ellen Pompeo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690186","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NDc2NjA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI1NDg1MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 November 1969","placeOfBirth":" Everett, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Ellen Kathleen Pompeo","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Ellen Kathleen Pompeo was born in Everett, Massachusetts, to Kathleen B.

To date, she has worked with some of the most revered directors in the industry, including Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Lasse Hallström, Oliver Stone and Garry Marshall. Whether lending dramatic authenticity or a natural comedic flair to her roles, Lewis graces the screen with remarkable range and an original and captivating style. Lewis was born in Los Angeles, Californa, to Glenis (Duggan) Batley, a graphic designer, and Geoffrey Lewis, an actor. By the age of six, she knew she wanted to be a performer. At twelve, Lewis landed her first leading role in the Showtime miniseries Home Fires (1987). After appearing in several TV sitcoms including The Wonder Years (1988), she made her move to film, starring with Chevy Chase in National Lampoon's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) and with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the drama Crooked Hearts (1991). At 16, Lewis starred opposite Brad Pitt in the critically acclaimed television movie Too Young to Die? (1990), catching the attention of Martin Scorsese, who cast her in his thriller Cape Fear (1991). Her powerful scenes with Robert De Niro captured the quiet complexities of adolescence and earned her an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe nomination for \"Best Supporting Actress\". Her auditorium scene with De Niro went down in movie history as one of cinema's classic scenes. Lewis next worked with Woody Allen in Husbands and Wives (1992), playing a self-assured college coed with a penchant for older men and, particularly, her married professor. She quickly followed suit with a succession of starring roles in a variety of blockbusters and critically acclaimed projects including Kalifornia (1993), Romeo Is Bleeding (1993), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) and Natural Born Killers (1994), Oliver Stone's controversial media satire about two mass murderers who become legendary folk heroes. Lewis's other credits include the Nora Ephron comedy Mixed Nuts (1994), with Steve Martin and Adam Sandler; the sci-fi action film Strange Days (1995) with Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett; Quentin Tarantino's vampire tale From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) with George Clooney; The Evening Star (1996) with Shirley MacLaine; the Garry Marshall-directed The Other Sister (1999), and Todd Phillips' Old School (2003), co-starring opposite Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as well as Starsky & Hutch (2004). In addition to her film career, Lewis has continued to add roles to her growing list of television credits with a performance in Showtime's My Louisiana Sky (2001), for which she secured an EMMY nomination, and a starring role in the Mira Nair-directed HBO's film Hysterical Blindness (2002), alongside Uma Thurman and Gena Rowlands. After a six-year hiatus from film to pursue her burgeoning music career exclusively, Lewis announced her return to acting with a handful of upcoming movies. Juliette starred alongside Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Kristen Wiig and Jimmy Fallon in the comedy Whip It (2009). The film was released by Fox Searchlight on October 2nd, 2009. Directed by Drew Barrymore, the film tells the story of an ex-beauty pageant contestant that leaves her crowns behind after joining a roller derby team. Lewis plays \"Iron Maven\", the star of a top derby team. Next, she joined the cast of the acclaimed European animated thriller Metropia (2009), as the voice of \"Nina\". She also appeared in the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), opposite Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman and Patrick Wilson. The film tells the story of a single mother (Aniston) who decides to have a child using a sperm donor. Juliette plays \"Debbie Epstein\", the best friend of Aniston's character. Lewis also appears in Sympathy for Delicious (2010), Mark Ruffalo's directorial debut. The film follows a paralyzed DJ, struggling to survive on the streets of LA who turns to faith healing and mysteriously develops the ability to cure the sick. Juliette plays \"Ariel\", costarring alongside Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney. The film took home the US Dramatic Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Most recently, Juliette Lewis appears in the indie-drama Conviction (2010), which stars Hilary Swank, Melissa Leo, Minnie Driver and Sam Rockwell. She plays \"Roseanna Perry\" in the true story of an unemployed single mother (Swank) who saw her brother begin serving a life sentence in 1983 for murder and robbery. The role has won Lewis praise from audiences and critics, alike, for her performance, with USA Today saying, \"Juliette Lewis has an indelible role\" and the San Francisco Chronicle saying \"Her character work should be studied in schools. Just remarkable\". In addition to Conviction (2010), Lewis also makes a cameo in Todd Phillips' comedy, Due Date (2010), starring Robert Downey Jr., Michelle Monaghan and Zach Galifianakis. Beginning in 2004, Juliette took a hiatus from acting to embark on a musical journey. After six years, two full length albums and countless high profile tours and festival gigs with her band, 'Juliette & the Licks', Juliette set out on a solo career. Releasing \"Terra Incognita\" last fall, the album has taken her all across the world from Europe to Japan to Turkey, Australia, North America and Canada.

Her parents, both academics, were from upper-class families. Her paternal grandfather, Hazard E. Reeves, was a sound pioneer who introduced magnetic stereophonic sound to films, and her maternal great-grandfather, James H. Hughes, was a U.S. Senator from Delaware (from 1937 to 1943). Perrey's parents preferred not to own a television but rather submerge their children in the vast realms of literature. Thus, her educational background ranged from years abroad in France and Italy to the Ivy League colleges of the US. Drama studies were what really interested her, however, resulting in her choosing an acting career. Her interests are as eclectic and diverse as the roles she has played and the life she has led. A lifelong vegetarian, she finds mental and physical balance in meditation and yoga, which she has faithfully practiced for over a decade. In the midst of acting, she also focuses much of her creative energies renovating a new home with her fiancée. She describes their abode as a \"quaint country oasis in the hills of Hollywood\". When not standing in line at Home Depot, she passionately donates her time to The International Fund for Animal Welfare and lives with many furry creatures. She joins the comically dynamic cast in DreamWorks' October release, Old School (2003), directed by Todd Phillips. Co-starring opposite Will Ferrell, she plays his traditional wife who is dedicated to the white picket fence dream. Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Leah Remini and Ellen Pompeo round out the stellar cast. Perrey is accomplished on both the big and small screens. She has co-starred in features such as Tri-Star's The Suburbans (1999), Miramax's Phoenix Arizona (1998), Trimark's Kicking and Screaming (1995) and Universal's Child's Play 3 (1991). She has landed series regular roles in four pilots and has guest starred on numerous television shows ranging from Fox's The X-Files (1993) to the WB's Off Centre (2001). She has played lead roles in made-for-television movies, including CBS' An Element of Truth (1995) and ABC's Escape to Witch Mountain (1995).

At Union High School, Lange excelled in baseball, becoming an All County third baseman. Working long afternoons with his loving contractor father, Artie developed a comical view of social classes, and his place in life as a barrel-chested Italian boy. After Artie completed high school, his father, who was a cable installer, fell off a roof and became a quadriplegic. Artie changed his college plans to be near his family, taking up odd jobs as a clerk, laborer and cab driver. After his fathers' death four years later, Artie quit his Port of Newark longshoreman's' job to play his first gig at New York's Improv in Hell's Kitchen. Gaining steadying success Artie pursued sketch comedy, helping to create the popular improvisation group, \"Live On Tape\". Doing improvisation landed Artie his major break. He was cast as an original member of Fox's MADtv (1995) in 1995. Hollywood success would bring down the comic with substance abuse and a possession for cocaine arrest. Mad TV fired him in 1997. After rehab, depression and a 40-pound weight gain, Lange found himself out of work until Saturday Night Live (1975)comedian Norm MacDonald remembered him. Lange played MacDonald's sidekick in both Dirty Work (1998) and ABC's Norm (1999). As a guest during a promotional tour with MacDonald,Howard Stern first heard and liked Lange. Years before, Artie and his father listened daily to the Howard Stern Show. Artie joined the nationally syndicated The Howard Stern Radio Show (1998)in 2001, bringing impressions and an average guy prospective to the radio and E network shows. However, his troubled past re-emerged through his years on the Stern show and Artie had fights with various staff members and splits with the show on several occasions up until his suicide attempt in 2010 when he left the show for good. Artie spent 7 months in a rehab center in Florida and emerged stating that he was finally clean and sober. Artie returned to radio in 2011 when, along with his friend Nick DiPaolo, they inked 3-year deals for a nationally syndicated radio show on Fox Sports. The show is called \"The Nick and Artie Show\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUzNTczMTczMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI0NjYyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005119","name":"Artie Lange","idIMDB":"nm0005119"},"actorId":"nm0005119","character":"Booker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017411","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Fischler","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279209","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNTM1NTkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg0MTQ2ODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 December 1969","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","bio":"Patrick Fischler was born on December 29, 1969 in Los Angeles, California, USA.
