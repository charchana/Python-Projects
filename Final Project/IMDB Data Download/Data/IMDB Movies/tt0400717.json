(Alsip) and Robert L. Sinise, A.C.E., a film editor. He is of Italian (from his paternal grandfather), English, Scottish, Irish, French, German, and Swedish ancestry. His family moved to Highland Park, where he attended high school. He was something of a rebel, playing in bands but paying little attention to school. Gary and some friends tried out for \"West Side Story\" as a lark, but Gary was hooked on acting for life by closing night. Gary credits his love for theatre to his drama teacher, Barbara Patterson. In 1974, Gary, Terry Kinney, and Jeff Perry founded the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. Initially performing in a church basement, the company grew and gained stature in the Chicago area. In addition to acting in many plays, Gary also directed some of Steppenwolf's most notable productions, including Sam Shepard's \"True West\". The company made its off-Broadway debut with that production, starring Gary and John Malkovich, and its Broadway debut with \"The Grapes of Wrath\" at the Cort Theatre in 1990. Gary's Hollywood career also started in the director's chair with two episodes of the stylish TV series Crime Story (1986), followed in 1988 by the feature Miles from Home (1988) starring Richard Gere. Gary's first feature film as an actor was the World War II fable A Midnight Clear (1992) in 1992. That year also found Gary combining his acting and directing talents with the critically acclaimed Of Mice and Men (1992). His first real notice by the public came in 1994, however. He starred in the blockbuster miniseries The Stand (1994), rapidly followed by his bravura performance as \"Lt. Dan\" in Forrest Gump (1994). His portrayal of the disabled, emotionally tortured veteran earned Gary numerous awards and an Oscar nomination. Busy 1994 was followed by busy 1995, first reuniting with Tom Hanks in Apollo 13 (1995) and then starring in the HBO film Truman (1995) which earned him the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards and an Emmy nomination. Gary is married to Moira Sinise, an actress and original member of the Steppenwolf company. They have three children, Sophie Sinise, McCanna Anthony Sinise and Ella Sinise.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE4NzcyMzU3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM2NDE2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000641","name":"Gary Sinise","idIMDB":"nm0000641"},"actorId":"nm0000641","character":"Shaw","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020225","main":true},{"actorName":"Debra Messing","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005226","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMjUzMjg3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc0NDU5OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 August 1968","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Debra Lynn Messing","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Messing was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the daughter of Jewish American parents, Sandra (née Simons), who has worked as a professional singer, banker, travel and real estate agent, and Brian Messing, a sales executive for a jewelry manufacturer. When Messing was three, she moved with her parents and her older brother, Brett, to East Greenwich, a small town outside Providence, Rhode Island. During her high school years, she acted (and sang) in a number of high school productions, including the starring role in the musical \"Annie\" and \"Fiddler On the Roof.\" Messing took lessons in dance, singing, and acting. In 1986, she was Rhode Island's Junior Miss and competed in Mobile, Alabama in the America's Junior Miss scholarship program. While her parents encouraged her dream of becoming an actress, they also urged her to complete a liberal arts education before deciding on acting as a career. Following their advice, she attended Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. In 1990, after graduating summa cum laude from Brandeis with a bachelor's degree in theater arts, Messing gained admission to the elite Graduate Acting Program (which accepts only about 15 new students annually) at New York University, where she earned a master's degree in fine arts after three years. In 1998, Messing played a lead role as the bio-anthropologist Sloan Parker on ABC's dramatic science fiction television series Prey. During this time her agent approached her with the pilot script for the television show Will & Grace. Messing was inclined to take some time off, but the script intrigued her, and she auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, beating out Nicollette Sheridan, who later guest-starred on the show as a romantic rival of Grace's. Will & Grace became a ratings success, and Messing gained renown. In 2002, she was named one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" by People Magazine. TV Guide picked her as its \"Best Dressed Woman\" in 2003. Messing met her husband, Daniel Zelman (an actor and screenwriter), on their first day as graduate students at NYU. The two were married on September 3, 2000, and live in New York City. On April 7, 2004, Messing gave birth to their son, Roman Walker Zelman.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMjUzMjg3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc0NDU5OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005226","name":"Debra Messing","idIMDB":"nm0005226"},"actorId":"nm0005226","character":"Beth","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020223","main":true},{"actorName":"Billy Connolly","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175262","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMzM2MTA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzIxNTM1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 November 1942","placeOfBirth":" Anderston, Glasgow, Scotland, UK","birthName":"William Connolly","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Billy Connolly was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland.

The amiable, husky-framed actor with the tight, crinkly hair was born in Queens, New York on October 19, 1966, the only child of Madeleine, an elementary school teacher, and Charles Favreau, a special education teacher. His father has French-Canadian, German, and Italian ancestry, and his mother was from a Jewish family. He attended the Bronx High School of Science before furthering his studies at Queens College in 1984. Dropping out just credits away from receiving his degree, Jon moved to Chicago where he focused on comedy and performed at several Chicago improvisational theaters, including the ImprovOlympic and the Improv Institute. He also found a couple of bit parts in films. While there, he earned another bit role in the film, Rudy (1993), and met fellow castmate Vince Vaughn. Their enduring personal friendship would play an instrumental role in furthering both their professional careers within just a few years. Jon broke into TV with a role on the classic series, Seinfeld (1989) (as \"Eric the Clown\"). After filming rudimentary roles in the movies Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994), Notes from Underground (1995) and Batman Forever (1995), he decided to do some risk taking by writing himself and friend Vaughn into what would become their breakthrough film. Swingers (1996), which he also co-produced, centers on Jon as a luckless, struggling actor type who is emotionally shattered after losing his girlfriend, but is pushed back into the L.A. social scene via the help of cool, worldly, outgoing actor/buddy Vaughn. These two blueprint roles went on to define the character types of both actors on film. In 1997, Jon appeared favorably on several episodes of the popular TV sitcom, Friends (1994), as \"Pete Becker\", the humdrum but extremely wealthy suitor for Courteney Cox's \"Monica\" character, and also appeared to fine advantage on the Tracey Takes On... (1996) comedy series. He later took on the biopic mini-movie, Rocky Marciano (1999), portraying the prizefighter himself in a highly challenging dramatic role and received excellent reviews. Other engagingly offbeat \"everyman\" films roles came Jon's way -- the ex-athlete in the working class film, Dogtown (1997); a soon-to-be groom whose bachelor party goes horribly awry in the comedy thriller Very Bad Things (1998); a newlywed opposite Famke Janssen in Love & Sex (2000); a wild and crazy linebacker in The Replacements (2000); as Ben Affleck's legal partner in Daredevil (2003); and another down-and-out actor in The Big Empty (2003). He wrote and directed himself and Vaughn as two fellow boxers who involve themselves in criminal activity in Made (2001). Both he and Vaughn produced. He also directed the highly popular Will Ferrell comedy, Elf (2003), in which he had a small part. Jon went on to re-team favorably with his friend, Vince Vaughn, who enjoyed a meteoric rise into the comedy star ranks, in such light-weight features as The Break-Up (2006), Tout... sauf en famille (2008) and Couples Retreat (2009), the last of which he co-wrote with Vaughn. He also made great strides as a producer/director in recent years with the exciting mega-box office action-packed Iron Man (2008), starring Robert Downey Jr. and its sequel, Iron Man 2 (2010). Favreau's marriage to Joya Tillem on November 24, 2000, produced son Max and two daughters, Madeleine and Brighton Rose. Joya is the niece of KGO (AM) lawyer and talk show host, Len Tillem. On the sly, the actor/writer/producer/director enjoys playing on the World Poker Tour.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgwNDg0MTI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg0MDQzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269463","name":"Jon Favreau","nicknames":["Favs"],"idIMDB":"nm0269463"},"actorId":"nm0269463","character":"Reilly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020226","main":true},{"actorName":"Jane Krakowski","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005105","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMTQ5NTI1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU2MDY2NzE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 October 1968","placeOfBirth":" Parsippany, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Jane Krajkowski","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Jane Krakowski was born in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, to Barbara (Benoit), a college theater instructor, and Edward Krajkowski, a chemical engineer.

Warburton starred for 7 seasons on the hit CBS comedy \"Rules of Engagement\" with David Spade, Oliver Hudson, and Megyn Price about two couples and their single friend, all at different stages in their relationships dealing with the complications of dating, commitment, and marriage. He is now set to star in NBC's newest sitcom series entitled \"Crowded,\" premiering Sunday, March 20th, about an empty nest couple (Warburton & Carrie Preston) who find out their adult daughters want to move back home with them. Patrick also played \"Guy\" in the international blockbuster comedy Ted and recently completed shooting the highly anticipated sequel Ted 2 where he reprises his role. Warburton starred on the ABC hit comedy \"Less than Perfect,\" as \"Jeb Denton,\" an opinionated network anchorman; and on the hit show \"NewsRadio\" as \"Johnny Johnson\" the unscrupulous business rival who takes over the station. Warburton starred in Disney's major motion picture, live action comedy Underdog, as the archenemy \"Cad,\" based on the 1964 cartoon television series. He is also perhaps the busiest voiceover artist in Hollywood for his many characters including the role of the paraplegic and over-zealous cop, \"Joe Swanson,\" on the hit comedy \"Family Guy.\" Warburton was the lead in the independent film The Civilization of Maxwell Bright, in which he stared as a vicious and self-destructive anti-hero who desperately needs to save his soul. The film won numerous festival awards in which Warburton captured Best Actor at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, New York VisionFest, and the Boulder International Film Festival. The film's other honors include Viewer's Choice at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, the Special Jury Award at WorldFest Houston and at the Florida Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Florida Film Festival, and the Vision Award for David Beaird at WorldFest Houston. This festival favorite is essentially a modern re-telling of \"Beauty and the Beast\" that explores what happens when a modern Neanderthal is locked in close proximity with a kind and loving woman. Written and directed by David Beaird, The Civilization of Maxwell Bright co-stars Jennifer Tilly, Marie Matiko, Simon Callow and Eric Roberts. In addition, Warburton starred in the independent feature film I'll Believe You alongside Fred Willard, Thomas Gibson, and Chris Elliott, a comedy for young adults/teens about a hunt for an alleged alien living in a small town after a mysterious phone call is received on a radio broadcast. The film was released in April of 2007 to 1,500 theaters nationwide, quite the accomplishment for a small independent film. To complement his animated films, Warburton voiced the hit cartoon series \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" and the animated feature Bee Movie with Jerry Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Uma Thurman and Oprah Winfrey. He played the character \"Rip Smashenburn\" in the UPN animated series \"Game Over,\" the voice of \"Brock Samson\" in the animated adult series \"The Venture Brothers,\" and the voice of \"Mr. Barkin\" on the Disney Channel's \"Disney's Kim Possible.\" He plays the character of Ian, \"the ultimate alpha-male,\" in the Sony animated film Open Season opposite Ashton Kutcher and Martin Lawrence. Playing in both regular theaters and Imax 3-D, it was a box office smash on its opening week as #1 and held top spots following its debut. Warburton's voice can also be heard alongside that of Sarah Michelle Geller, Sigourney Weaver, George Carlin, Andy Dick, and Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated feature film Happily N'ever After, from the producers of Shrek, where he plays the voice of \"Prince Humperdink.\" As the voice of the \"Savior of the Universe\" in Disney's animated Saturday morning TV series \"Buzz Lightyear,\" Warburton's voice graced the big screen in the Disney animated film The Emperor's New Groove, Kronks New Groove and \"The Emperor's New School.\" Warburton started his television career appearing regularly on the CBS sitcom \"Dave's World,\" with Harry Anderson and Mesach Taylor and originally guest-starred on \"Seinfeld\" as the painted-faced New Jersey Devils' fan and Jerry's mechanic, only to become one of the show's funniest fixtures. He also did commercial spots for American Express (as the voice of \"Superman\" alongside Seinfeld), Cadillac, and M&Ms. Warburton starred in The Woman Chaser, which received critical acclaim at the prestigious New York Film Festival and The Sundance Film Festival, as well as opposite Sam Neill in The Dish, an Australian production about the first man on the moon. Barry Sonnenfeld directed Warburton in the Columbia Tri Star half-hour comedy \"The Tick,\" which continues to have a huge cult following since its release on DVD. The show gained its popularity with audiences due to its relaxed, adult-friendly comedy. \"The Tick\", in addition to the DVD, has released action figures, t-shirts, and Quaker Oat Life cereal boxes with \"The Tick\" character adorning the cover. He also paired up with Tim Allen in Sonnenfeld's feature films Big Trouble and Joe Somebody, and also appeared in Scream 3 and Men in Black 2. A native Californian, Patrick grew up in Huntington Beach and resides in Los Angeles with his wife Cathy and four children Talon, Alexandra (Lexie), Shane, and Gabriel.
