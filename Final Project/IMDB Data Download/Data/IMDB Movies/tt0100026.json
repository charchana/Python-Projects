He graduated from Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola High School in San Juan. Here he studied the rigorous classical curriculum of the Jesuits and was always active in student dramatics. Julia was discovered while performing in a nightclub in San Juan by actor Orson Bean who inspired him to move to the mainland to pursue other projects. Julia moved to Manhattan, New York City in 1964 and quickly found work by acting in small and supporting roles in off-Broadway shows. In 1966, Julia began appearing in Shakespearean roles, creating a deliciously conniving Edmund in \"King Lear\" in 1973 and a smoldering Othello in 1979. Julia also made his mark on the musical stage playing one of the \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" during its run in 1971, and a chilling role of Mack the Knife in \"The Threepenny Opera\" in 1976 and as a Felliniesque film director in \"Nine\" in 1982. The stage successes led to his movie works where he is better known. One of his best movie roles is a passionate political prisoner in Le baiser de la femme-araignée (1985). Julia also appeared as dramatic heroes and memorable villains in a number of films and made-for-TV-movies. His later roles included the crazy macabre Gomez Addams in two Addams Family movies. With his health declining from 1993 onward after he underwent a surgical operation for stomach cancer, Julia kept on acting, where he traveled to Mexico during the winter of 1993-1994 to play the Brazilian Amazon forest activist Chico Mendes in The Burning Season: The Chico Mendes Story (1994), for which he posthumously won a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. His last theatrical movie was filmed shortly after The Burning Season: The Chico Mendes Story (1994) when he traveled to Australia to shoot all of his scenes for Street Fighter - L'ultime combat (1994), based on the popular video game where he played the villainous General M. Bison. His last role was a supporting part in another made-for-TV movie titled Down Came a Blackbird (1995). On October 16, 1994, the weakened and gaunt Raul Julia suffered a stroke in New York City where he fell into a coma a few days later and was put on life support. He was transferred to a hospice in nearby Manhasset, Long Island where his weakened body finally gave up the struggle on October 24, at age 54. His body was flown back to Puerto Rico for burial where thousands turned out for his state funeral to remember him. Two honoring ceremonies were held at Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola High School, and at the Headquarters of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture prior to his burial.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMyOTgzODYyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE5OTgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000471","name":"Raul Julia","idIMDB":"nm0000471"},"actorId":"nm0000471","character":"Paulo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Henry Darrow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201688","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDI5MTYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUwOTYzOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 September 1933","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Enrique Tomás Delgado","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"In the late 1960s Henry Darrow was THE ultimate Latin heartthrob on television. With a smooth, ingratiating style and a killer smile that brightened up the small screen, he also hit a cultural acting landmark as the first Hispanic actor to portray Zorro on TV. He was born Enrique Tomás Delgado in New York City, on September 15, 1933, the first son of émigrés Enrique St. and Gloria Delgado. He made his debut at age 8 in a school play, which piqued his interest. The father moved his family (which included younger brother Dennis) back to his homeland of Puerto Rico out of prospective business concerns. While there Henry was elected president of his class at high school and attended the University of Rio Piedras as a political science and theater major. His fluency in two languages helped earn him supplementary income as an interpreter. Henry returned to the States on scholarships received from The Little Theater of Puerto Rico and the University of Puerto Rico, and eventually received his Bachelor's degree. He initially trained at the Pasadena Playhouse (1954), in the Los Angeles area, where he met and later married first wife, Lucy, an aspiring actress. They went on to have two children, Denise (Dee-Dee) and Tom. He began seeking employment on film and TV, making his big screen debut unbilled in the light comedy Holiday for Lovers (1959). He found steadier work, however, on TV and appeared in a number rugged series, primarily westerns, including \"Wagon Train,\" \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Bonanza\" and \"Daniel Boone\". On stage he continued to hone his craft in such plays as \"The Alchemist\" (1963) and \"Dark of the Moon\" (1966). While appearing in the 1965 stage production of \"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit\" at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles, the by-now TV veteran was spotted by producer David Dortort. Dortort later remembered Henry (who was then going by the name Henry Delgado) and thought him perfect for his upcoming western series The High Chaparral (1967). Billed now as Henry Darrow, the actor stole women's hearts and much of the proceedings as the roguish ladies' man Manolito Montoya, who'd rather make love than war. He reached his TV peak in the western program, which also starred Leif Erickson, Cameron Mitchell and Linda Cristal, who played his sister. The show ran for four seasons. Following this peak, Henry went on to earn a daytime Emmy for his role on Santa Barbara (1984) after joining the cast in 1989. Although he never found a strong footing in films, his better supporting work has been seen in Badge 373 (1973) and Walk Proud (1979). TV movies have included Night Games (1974), Aloha Means Goodbye (1974), Centennial (1978) and Attica (1980). As for his enduring relationship with the famed Zorro character, Darrow is not only the first Latino Zorro on TV, but also provided the title voice for two 1980s animated series. In the early 1990s, Henry replaced Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Zorro's father in yet another cable reincarnation of the series. This show was shot in Spain. Henry continued to perform on the stage with opportunities ranging from the role Iago in \"Othello\" to a (still-running) one-man show entitled \"That Certain Cervantes\", which made its premiere in 2001. A founder of \"Nosotros\", an organization that gears Hispanic actors toward non-stereotyped parts, Darrow was the inaugural winner of the Ricardo Montalban/Nosotros Award for his contributions to improving the image of Latinos. He lives in North Carolina with his second wife of many years, Lauren Levian, an actress/screenwriter/producer. The couple have been working on putting together a two person show.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDI5MTYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUwOTYzOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201688","name":"Henry Darrow","nicknames":["Hank"],"idIMDB":"nm0201688"},"actorId":"nm0201688","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Miguel Ángel Suárez","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0840822","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MDU3NTEwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYxOTUyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 July 1939","placeOfBirth":" San Juan, Puerto Rico","birthName":"Miguelángel Suárez","bio":"Miguel Ángel Suárez was born on July 5, 1939 in San Juan, Puerto Rico as Miguelángel Suárez.
