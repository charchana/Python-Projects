Whilst a student there he won the BBC Special Prize, enabling him to act in radio plays. On graduation he made his stage debut in 'The Tempest' at the old Mermaid Theatre directed by actor Bernard Miles and played in repertory companies throughout England, making his film debut as the youngest son in the remake of 'The Barrets of Wimpole Street'. When the war-time film comedy 'Desert Mice' was being cast he went to audition with the producers, stuck his head round their door and said 'Hello' and was told 'You're just what we wanted' and throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s he appeared in several light comedy films as 'silly-ass' young British twits though he was somewhat in the shadow of the more established and slightly older Ian Carmichael who had made such roles his own. The demand for rougher, more down-to-earth young leading men in the British cinema of the 1960s effectively relegated him to character parts and cameos as junior officers, as in 'Lawrence of Arabia', and petty officials, though he did have a good role as the effete, discarded boyfriend, Cecil, in a 1970s television version of 'A Room With A View', and it is a little ironic that his last screen role before his early death was as a cast member of the film-within-a-film in 'The Mirror Crack'd', a throwback to the British cinema of the 1950s when he began his cinema career.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0287219","name":"Kenneth Fortescue","idIMDB":"nm0287219"},"actorId":"nm0287219","character":"Secretary, CID","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gladys Henson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378209","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 September 1897","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","birthName":"Gladys Gunn","bio":"Gladys Henson was born on September 27, 1897 in Dublin, Ireland as Gladys Gunn.

Born into a theatrical family, he made his stage debut at age six and later attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He first appeared on the West End stage in London in 1928, and continued to work in the theatre during the 1930s, taking only occasional film roles. It was only after World War II that he concentrated his efforts on the cinema, and was much in demand in British films of the 1950s as friendly authority figures, including army sergeants, police detectives or navy officers. Detectives became a particular specialty, and he played this role in more than a dozen films, including The Blue Lamp (1950), Beat the Devil (1953) and The Detective (1954). In the early 1960s, he also made regular appearances as police detectives in the The Edgar Wallace Mystery Theatre (1960) second feature series, usually as \"Inspector Meredith\". He also made memorable appearances in The Third Man (1949), Operation Disaster (1950), Glory at Sea (1952), Pursuit of the Graf Spee (1956), Dunkirk (1958) and Whistle Down the Wind (1961). He was effectively cast against type in only two films, as the union agitator in The Angry Silence (1960), and as a disgruntled civil servant who becomes a spy for the Russians in Ring of Treason (1964). In 1962, he made his first appearance as the head of the British secret service in the first James Bond film, Dr. No (1962). He went on to be featured in the next ten films in the series, appearing with Sean Connery, George Lazenby and, later, Roger Moore as Bond, and will probably be considered the definitive \"M\" by more than one generation of Bond fans.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NTc3MTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM5NjU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496866","name":"Bernard Lee","idIMDB":"nm0496866"},"actorId":"nm0496866","character":"Supt.
