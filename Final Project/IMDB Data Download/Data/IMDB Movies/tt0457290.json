Her large extended family are some of Scarlett's biggest supporters and fans. At age 8, Scarlett followed the footsteps of her mother - a former jockey - and took her first riding lesson. By age 17, Scarlett had earned notoriety as a successful horse trainer and riding instructor. In addition to her job as an instructor/trainer, she volunteered for T.R.O.T., an organization that enables mentally and physically handicapped children to gain confidence and physical strength through closely supervised horseback riding. And all that while, she was competing in equestrian events throughout the Southern U.S., earning numerous trophies, ribbons and other awards. When Scarlett was 15 she auditioned for a role with a local Murder Mystery/Dinner Theatre group. Despite having no prior acting experience, she landed that role (and many others afterward), and what began as a whim and a hobby soon became a career commitment. After receiving encouragement and praise from well-known casting director, Jo Edna Boldin, Scarlett began auditioning for film and television roles. At the same time, her mother Linda, no stranger to the entertainment industry (her own father is a theater owner), decided that in order to help Scarlett land auditions, she should become licensed as an agent. Linda McAlister Talent was launched in 1994, and is today one of Texas' most respected agencies, representing professional, well-trained film and television actors. And although Linda treats Scarlett exactly as she does her other talent, she does admit that Scarlett is one of her most sought-after actors. Now, with more than 40 film and television roles, and over 250 commercials, industrials, print ads and voice-overs to her credit, Scarlett has gained considerable respect in the acting community. Like most committed actors, she continuously works on improving her craft by taking ongoing acting classes as well as frequently participating in industry seminars and educational events. While living in Texas, Scarlett was a dedicated professional in the equestrian field. As proprietor of McAlister Harris Performance Horses, she developed, trained, and coached a team of exceptional riders and horses. With the assistance of younger sister Molly, they proudly attended many equestrian competitions and events with MHPH's talented group of riders. She now resides in the Los Angeles, California area with her husband Chris Harris, an SMU graduate and Information Technology professional. Together they have a 225lb English Mastiff named Angus and look forward to owning a larger home to accommodate the pot-bellied pigs, ferrets, horses, cats, dogs, birds, (and someday) children, that will surely follow.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzk3NDE4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAzODk2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0563944","name":"Scarlett McAlister","idIMDB":"nm0563944"},"actorId":"nm0563944","character":"Mabe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Krieger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0471216","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MTYzMDk2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5OTgyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Steve Krieger is known for his work on A Scanner Darkly (2006), Wall Street (1987) and The Money Pit (1986).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MTYzMDk2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5OTgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0471216","name":"Steve Krieger","idIMDB":"nm0471216"},"actorId":"nm0471216","character":"Tave Boneffer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeff Speakman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0817275","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxNTY4NTU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkwNDAxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 November 1958","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Jeffrey F.

With his first film \"The Keyman: Finding Redemption\", Millican explored the issues of regret and abandonment on the streets and the destructive power of unforgiveness. That movie starred Adam Baldwin and is being released worldwide by Artistview Entertainment out of LA. Millican's sophomore project was the film \"A Promise Kept\" starring Sean Patrick Flannery, Joey Lauren Adams, Jeff Speakman and Mimi Rogers (\"The Gunman\" for US video). This movie asks the question, \"Do we take justice into our own hands, even for the most noble causes\"? Worldwide sales have been strong and the movie was released on video in the summer of 2004. Lifetime Movie Network premiered the film on television in January of 2005. \"Bloodlines\" is drawn from Millican's experiences working in the corporate environment. Millican grew up in Austin and received his degree in Communications from the University of Texas at Arlington and now makes his home in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. He met his wife Jill at a campus Christian ministry at UTA. Before attending the university, Jill had graduated from a Bible College and had been a missionary. From there, Millican went to work in broadcasting and video/film production, in both small and large venue. Later Millican would be the General Manager for the facility, directing all the big projects that came trough. Millican has won over 30 international awards for his writing, directing, editing and producing of films, television, music videos, commercials and corporate films. That experience has led him to make films in the style of Robert Rodriguez-as far as the technical areas. Like Rodriguez, Millican writes, directs, produces and edits his own features and even occasionally composes and performs the musical score. Millican lives with wife, two children and the large Newfoundland dog. He's a self proclaimed golf-aholic and also enjoys computer games.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjIxNjY1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc2Nzky._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0989649","name":"Daniel Millican","idIMDB":"nm0989649"},"actorId":"nm0989649","character":"Judd","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lisa Palmer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1952253","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Lisa Palmer is an actress, known for Striking Range (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1952253","name":"Lisa Palmer","idIMDB":"nm1952253"},"actorId":"nm1952253","character":"Sharon Careington","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"San Banarje","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1891236","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMjYwMjA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk5OTkyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"San Banarje is a producer and cinematographer, known for Bodhisattva (2010), The Shadow Behind You (2015) and The Nowhere Son (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMjYwMjA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk5OTkyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1891236","name":"San Banarje","nicknames":["Tintin"],"idIMDB":"nm1891236"},"actorId":"nm1891236","character":"Latin Mafia Leader","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gary Head","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1296086","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Gary Head is an actor, known for Striking Range (2006), Young Producers (2010) and West Texas Khaki (1998).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1296086","name":"Gary Head","idIMDB":"nm1296086"},"actorId":"nm1296086","character":"Security Guard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Scott Roland","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0738084","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 May 1963","placeOfBirth":" Greenville, Texas, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Scott was born in Greenville Texas and became a stuntman in 1990.
