Her mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and her father, Ira Owens Beaty, a professor of psychology and real estate agent, was from Virginia. Her brother, Warren Beatty, was born on March 30, 1937. Her ancestry includes English and Scottish. Shirley was the tallest in her ballet classes at the Washington School of Ballet. Just after she graduated from Washington-Lee High School, she packed her bags and headed for New York. While auditioning for Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Me and Juliet\", the producer kept mispronouncing her name. She then changed her name from Shirley MacLean Beaty to Shirley MacLaine. She later had a role in \"The Pajama Game\", as a member of the chorus and understudy to Carol Haney. A few months into the run, Shirley was going to leave the show for the lead role in \"Can-Can\" but ended up filling in for Haney, who had broken her ankle and could not perform. She would fill in for Carol, again, three months later, following another injury, the very night that movie producer Hal B. Wallis was in the audience. Wallis signed MacLaine to a five-year contract to Paramount Pictures. Three months later, she was off to shoot The Trouble with Harry (1955). She then took roles in Hot Spell (1958) and Around the World in Eighty Days (1956), completed not too long before her daughter, Sachi Parker (born Stephanie), was born. With Shirley's career on track, she played one of her most challenging roles: \"Ginny Moorhead\" in Some Came Running (1958), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She went on to do The Sheepman (1958) and The Matchmaker (1958). In 1960, she got her second Academy Award nomination for The Apartment (1960). Three years later, she received a third nomination for Irma la Douce (1963). In 1969, she brought her friend Bob Fosse from Broadway to direct her in Sweet Charity (1969), from which she got her \"signature\" song, \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\". After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made a documentary on China called The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir (1975), for which she received an Oscar nomination for best documentary. In 1977, she got her fourth Best Actress Oscar nomination for The Turning Point (1977). In 1979, she worked with Peter Sellers in Being There (1979), made shortly before his death. After 20 years in the film industry, she finally took home the Best Actress Oscar for Terms of Endearment (1983). After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made Madame Sousatzka (1988), a critical and financial hit that took top prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 1989, she starred with Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts in Steel Magnolias (1989). She received rave reviews playing Meryl Streep's mother in Postcards from the Edge (1990) and for Guarding Tess (1994). In 1996, she reprised her role from \"Terms of Endearment\" as \"Aurora Greenway\" in The Evening Star (1996), which didn't repeat its predecessor's success at the box office. In mid-1998, she directed Bruno (2000), which starred Alex D. Linz. In February 2001, Shirley worked with close friends once again in These Old Broads (2001), and co-starred with Julia Stiles in Carolina (2003) and with Kirstie Alley in Salem Witch Trials (2002). MacLaine as her own website which includes her own radio show and interviews, the Encounter Board, and Independent Expression, a members-only section of the site. In the past few years, Shirley starred in a CBS miniseries based on the life of cosmetics queen Mary Kay Ash--The Battle of Mary Kay (2002), and wrote two more books, \"The Camino\" in 2001, and \"Out On A Leash\" in 2003. After taking a slight hiatus from motion pictures, Shirley returned with roles in the movies that were small, but wonderfully scene-stealing: Bewitched (2005) with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, In Her Shoes (2005) with Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette, in which Shirley was nominated for a Golden Globe in the best supporting actress category, and Rumor Has It... (2005) with Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner. Shirley completed filming of Closing the Ring (2007), directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, in 2007. Her latest book is entitled \"Sage-ing While Ag-ing\"; Shirley's latest film is Valentine's Day (2010), which debuted in theaters on February 12, 2010.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTE5MjQ1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzU2MDg1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000511","name":"Shirley MacLaine","idIMDB":"nm0000511"},"actorId":"nm0000511","character":"Kate Westbourne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0250263","main":true},{"actorName":"Debbie Reynolds","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001666","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NTAzNzM0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY4OTY2Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 April 1932","placeOfBirth":" El Paso, Texas, USA","birthName":"Mary Frances Reynolds","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Debbie Reynolds was born Mary Frances Reynolds in El Paso, Texas, the second child of Maxine N. (Harmon) and Raymond Francis Reynolds, a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Her film career began at MGM after she won a beauty contest at age 16 impersonating Betty Hutton. Reynolds wasn't a dancer until she was selected to be Gene Kelly's partner in Singin' in the Rain (1952). Not yet twenty, she was a quick study. Twelve years later, it seemed like she had been around forever. Most of her early film work was in MGM musicals, as perky, wholesome young women. She continued to use her dancing skills with stage work. She was 31 when she gave an Academy Award-nominated performance in The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964). She survived losing first husband Eddie Fisher to Elizabeth Taylor following the tragic death of Michael Todd. Her second husband, shoe magnate Harry Karl, gambled away his fortune as well as hers. With her children as well as Karl's, she had to keep working and turned to the stage. She had her own casino in Las Vegas with a home for her collection of Hollywood memorabilia until its closure in 1997. She took the time to personally write a long letter that is on display in the Judy Garland museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota and to provide that museum with replicas of Garland's costumes. The originals are in her newly-opened museum in Hollywood. Nearly all the money she makes is spent toward her goal of creating a Hollywood museum. Her collection numbers more than 3000 costumes and 46,000 square-feet worth of props and equipment. With musician/actor Eddie Fisher, she was the mother of filmmaker Todd Fisher and actress Carrie Fisher. Debbie died of a stroke on December 28, 2016, one day after the death of her daughter Carrie. She was survived by her son and granddaughter, up-and-coming actress Billie Lourd.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NTAzNzM0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY4OTY2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001666","name":"Debbie Reynolds","nicknames":["Princess Leia's Mom","Frannie","Aba Dabba"],"idIMDB":"nm0001666"},"actorId":"nm0001666","character":"Piper Grayson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0250264","main":true},{"actorName":"Joan Collins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001058","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMjY3NzU2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTg4OTQz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 May 1933","placeOfBirth":" Paddington, London, England, UK","birthName":"Joan Henrietta Collins","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Joan Collins was born on May 23, 1933 in Paddington, London, England as Joan Henrietta Collins.

She was known internationally for her beauty, especially for her violet eyes, with which she captured audiences early on in her youth and kept the world hooked on with since. Taylor was born on February 27, 1932 in London, England. Although she was born an English subject, her parents, Sara Sothern (née Sara Viola Warmbrodt) and Francis Lenn Taylor, were Americans, art dealers from St. Louis, Missouri (her father had gone to London to set up a gallery). Her mother had been an actress on the stage, but gave up that vocation when she married. Elizabeth lived in London until the age of seven, when the family left for the US when the clouds of war began brewing in Europe in 1939. They sailed without her father, who stayed behind to wrap up the loose ends of the art business. The family relocated to Los Angeles, where Mrs. Taylor's own family had moved. Mr. Taylor followed not long afterward. A family friend noticed the strikingly beautiful little Elizabeth and suggested that she be taken for a screen test. Her test impressed executives at Universal Pictures enough to sign her to a contract. Her first foray onto the screen was in There's One Born Every Minute (1942), released when she was ten. Universal dropped her contract after that one film, but Elizabeth was soon picked up by MGM. The first production she made with that studio was Lassie Come Home (1943), and on the strength of that one film, MGM signed her for a full year. She had minuscule parts in her next two films, The White Cliffs of Dover (1944) and Jane Eyre (1943) (the former made while she was on loan to 20th Century-Fox). Then came the picture that made Elizabeth a star: MGM's National Velvet (1944). She played Velvet Brown opposite Mickey Rooney. The film was a smash hit, grossing over $4 million. Elizabeth now had a long-term contract with MGM and was its top child star. She made no films in 1945, but returned in 1946 in Courage of Lassie (1946), another success. In 1947, when she was 15, she starred in Life with Father (1947) with such heavyweights as William Powell, Irene Dunne and Zasu Pitts, which was one of the biggest box office hits of the year. She also co-starred in the ensemble film Little Women (1949), which was also a box office huge success. Throughout the 1950s, Elizabeth appeared in film after film with mostly good results, starting with her role in the George Stevens film A Place in the Sun (1951), co-starring her good friend Montgomery Clift. The following year, she co-starred in Ivanhoe (1952), one of the biggest box office hits of the year. Her busiest year was 1954. She had a supporting role in the box office flop Beau Brummell (1954), but later that year starred in the hits The Last Time I Saw Paris (1954) and Elephant Walk (1954). She was 22 now, and even at that young age was considered one of the world's great beauties. In 1955 she appeared in the hit Giant (1956) with James Dean. Sadly, Dean never saw the release of the film, as he died in a car accident in 1955. The next year saw Elizabeth co-star with Montgomery Clift in Raintree County (1957), an overblown epic made, partially, in Kentucky. Critics called it dry as dust. In addition, Clift was seriously injured during the film, with Taylor helping save his life. Despite the film's shortcomings and off-camera tragedy, Elizabeth was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Southern belle Susanna Drake. However, on Oscar night the honor went to Joanne Woodward for The Three Faces of Eve (1957). In 1958 Elizabeth starred as Maggie Pollitt in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958). The film received rave reviews from the critics and Elizabeth was nominated again for an Academy Award for best actress, but this time she lost to Susan Hayward in I Want to Live! (1958). She was still a hot commodity in the film world, though. In 1959 she appeared in another mega-hit and received yet another Oscar nomination for Suddenly, Last Summer (1959). Once again, however, she lost out, this time to Simone Signoret for Room at the Top (1959). Her Oscar drought ended in 1960 when she brought home the coveted statue for her performance in BUtterfield 8 (1960) as Gloria Wandrous, a call girl who is involved with a married man. Some critics blasted the movie but they couldn't ignore her performance. There were no more films for Elizabeth for three years. She left MGM after her contract ran out, but would do projects for the studio later down the road. In 1963 she starred in Cleopatra (1963), which was one of the most expensive productions up to that time--as was her salary, a whopping $1,000,000. The film took years to complete, due in part to a serious illness during which she nearly died. This was the film where she met her future and fifth husband, Richard Burton (the previous four were Conrad Hilton, Michael Wilding, Michael Todd--who died in a plane crash--and Eddie Fisher). Her next films, The V.I.P.s (1963) and The Sandpiper (1965), were lackluster at best. Elizabeth was to return to fine form, however, with the role of Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). Her performance as the loudmouthed, shrewish, unkempt, yet still alluring Martha was easily her finest to date. For this she would win her second Oscar and one that was more than well-deserved. The following year, she and Burton co-starred in La mégère apprivoisée (1967), again giving winning performances. However, her films afterward were box office failures, including Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), Les comédiens (1967) Boom! (1968) (again co-starring with Burton), Secret Ceremony (1968), The Only Game in Town (1970), X, Y and Zee (1972), Hammersmith Is Out (1972) (with Burton again), Ash Wednesday (1973), Night Watch (1973), The Driver's Seat (1974), The Blue Bird (1976) (considered by many to be her worst), A Little Night Music (1977), and Winter Kills (1979) (a controversial film which was never given a full release and in which she only had a small role). Since then, she has appeared in some movies, both theatrical and made-for-television, and a number of television programs. In February 1997, Elizabeth entered the hospital for the removal of a brain tumor. The operation was successful. As for her private life, she divorced Burton in 1974, only to remarry him in 1975 and divorce him, permanently, in 1976. She had two more husbands, U.S. Senator John Warner and construction worker Larry Fortensky, whom she met in rehab. In 1959, Taylor converted to Judaism, and continued to identify herself as Jewish throughout her life, being active in Jewish causes. Upon the death of her friend, actor Rock Hudson, in 1985, she began her crusade on the behalf of AIDS sufferers. In the 1990s, she also developed a successful series of scents. In her later years, her acting career was relegated to the occasional TV-movie or TV guest appearance. Elizabeth Taylor died on March 23, 2011 in Los Angeles, from congestive heart failure. Her final resting place is Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMTc5MDg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE4NjMzNDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000072","name":"Elizabeth Taylor","nicknames":["Liz","Kitten"],"idIMDB":"nm0000072"},"actorId":"nm0000072","character":"Beryl Mason","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0243170","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Silverman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001738","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NjY5OTAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg3NDQ2MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 August 1966","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Jonathan Elihu Silverman","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Jonathan Silverman was born on August 5, 1966 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Jonathan Elihu Silverman.

The young actor made it to Braodway in 1942 with the musical \"New Moon\" in 1942 and went on to appear in the 1944 Mae West vehicle \"Catherine Was Great,\" where he met and subsequently married chorine Betty Barry, whose stage name at the time was Julie Carson. For the rest of the decade, Gene appeared in a random selection of plays and musicals, which did little to elevate his standing. Hollywood finally beckoned in the 1950s after gaining some notice on the program \"Hollywood Screen Test,\" and Paramount signed him up. Gene had stoic co-starring roles in such dramatic \"B\" films as The Atomic City (1952) (his debut movie), Those Redheads from Seattle (1953), and Alaska Seas (1954), none of which capitalized on his singing skills. The one movie in which he did sing, Red Garters (1954), did not fare well with the public. His most recognizable role during this period was as Dr. Clayton Forrester, a scientist who finds himself in the midst of a Martian invasion in the cult sci-fi classic The War of the Worlds (1953). Television became his preferred medium after being offered the title role in Bat Masterson (1958), and he quickly established a very profitable niche as a suave, dapper gentleman in this and other TV productions. Despite the elegant, globe-trotting typecast that befell him, his other TV gents proved just as successful: jet-setting detective Amos Burke in Burke's Law (1963), for which he won a Golden Globe award, and the impeccably-dressed publishing tycoon Glenn Howard in The Name of the Game (1968). Gene revisited the stage and cabaret venues in the 1970s when his on-camera career hit a lull, appearing frequently with his wife as co-star. The singer/actor made a triumphant return to Broadway in 1983 starring as a gay boulevardier in the musical version of the popular French film La Cage aux Folles (1978), which earned him a Tony nomination. He lost the Tony to his more flamboyant co-star George Hearn. After a year on Broadway, he joined the road company in San Francisco and played Los Angeles for a long stint. Another musicals included \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,\" \"Watergate: The Musical\" (as Nixon), \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (with his wife) and \"No, No, Nanette\". Gene's also appeared in his one-man cabaret show entitled \"Gene Barry in One\" from time to time. In later years he has made only occasional TV and stage appearances (bringing back his famous characters Bat Masterson and Amos Burke, much to the enjoyment of his fans), preferring to indulge in his hobby of painting. He made a very brief return to feature films sharing a cameo scene with one-time co-star Ann Robinson in Steven Spielberg's epic remake of The War of the Worlds (2005) with both of them playing the Tom Cruise character's wife's parents. Also a political activist, his wife Betty died in 2003 after a nearly 60-year marriage. The couple had two sons of their own and adopted a daughter in middle age. Gene himself passed away on December 9, 2009, at age 90.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MjQ1MjQyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY0NTUwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0058001","name":"Gene Barry","idIMDB":"nm0058001"},"actorId":"nm0058001","character":"Mr. Stern","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pat Harrington Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364224","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MDE5NTk1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQxMDU4Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 August 1929","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Daniel Patrick Harrington Jr.","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Pat Harrington Jr. was born on August 13, 1929 in New York City, New York, USA as Daniel Patrick Harrington Jr. He was an actor and writer, known for One Day at a Time (1975), The President's Analyst (1967) and Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels (1977).
