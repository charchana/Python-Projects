Her grandfather owned a casino, Karl's Silver Club, in Sparks. She was raised by her mother and her mother's partner. Beginning as a child actress, and then stepping up to roles as a young adult, Malone's career path has been compared to that of Jodie Foster, herself a former child actress and who has co-starred with Malone in two movies. Jena is often described as having a maturity beyond her years and, in her career thus far, she has often tackled roles that are difficult and are not standard fare for actors her age. Malone's first claim to fame was in performing the title role in Bastard Out of Carolina (1996) for which she won the Young Artist Award, and which she filmed when she was merely ten years old. This movie dealt with issues of child abuse, violence and sex. Jena has said in later interviews that this movie and her participation in it continue to influence her life substantially. Showing self-assurance and a clear vision of personal goals from an early age, Jena, at age 14, was encouraged to try out for Air Force One (1997), a movie that was virtually guaranteed to be a success since box-office king Harrison Ford was cast in the lead, but Jena said she'd prefer to seek other roles that were of more interest to her. In the following years, Malone appeared in several made-for-TV movies for which she won or was nominated for many awards. In 1997, she lucked in to being cast in the blockbuster Contact (1997) where she portrayed the child version of Jodie Foster's lead character. Foster stated that she built her character by mimicking Jena. And, in 1998, Jena was cast in the major film Stepmom (1998) where she co-starred with Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris. Jena was given what was likely the best line in that movie where her character, bitter over her parents' divorce, confronts her father who has returned home briefly; at a moment of crisis, her dad tells her \"You do NOT run out on your mother\", and the rueful Malone exclaims \"No -- that's YOUR job\". Also, in 1998, Malone appeared in a two-part episode of the critically acclaimed TV series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993). Contrary to what might usually be expected of a teenage actress, in this episode, Jena played the complex role of the perpetrator of a crime, which she portrayed with subtlety. At age 15, Jena was legally emancipated and thus took direct control of her finances and her career. Malone began getting more attention and acclaim in her next set of films: the artistic cult film Donnie Darko (2001); the teenage journey The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (2002) where she again co-starred with Jodie Foster; and the satirical Saved! (2004) which debuted Jena as the lead in a movie. Jena has expressed an interest in directing some day, and so she is preparing for roles behind the camera as well as in front. In 2002, she co-produced American Girl (2002) while also starring in it. And, in 2003, she undertook a formal study of photography. In early 2006, Malone debuted on the Broadway stage in the play \"Doubt\". A review by Broadway.com characterized her performance as \"astonishing\". Many people in Hollywood have jobs as actors. Watch for Jena Malone. She is an artist.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NDM5OTE0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMzNjM0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0540441","name":"Jena Malone","idIMDB":"nm0540441"},"actorId":"nm0540441","character":"Young Ellie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005786","main":true},{"actorName":"David Morse","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001556","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNjUzOTE1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU4NDQ0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 October 1953","placeOfBirth":" Hamilton, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"David Bowditch Morse","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"David Morse, a 6' 4\" tall blue-eyed blond who performed on stage for 10 years before breaking into film, became established as a respected supporting, character actor and second lead. He was born the first of four children of Charles, a sales manager, and Jacquelyn Morse, a schoolteacher, on October 11, 1953, in Beverly, Massachusetts. He grew up with three younger sisters. After graduating from high school, Morse studied acting at the William Esper Studio. In 1971, he began his professional acting career appearing in over 30 productions with the Boston Repertory Company from 1971 to 1977. In the late 1970s, Morse continued his stage career with the Circle Repertory Company in New York before moving into television and film. In the late 1990s, he returned to the Off-Broadway stage starring in Paula Vogel's Pulitzer Prize winning drama, \"How I Learned to Drive\" (1997), for which he won the Drama Desk Award and the Obie. Morse made his big screen debut in 1980 co-starring as \"Jerry Maxwell\", a cheerful bartender turned basketball player, opposite John Savage and Diana Scarwid in Inside Moves (1980), written by Barry Levinson and directed by Richard Donner. Although Inside Moves (1980) was nominated for an Oscar, Morse had to wait a few years until his career took off. His big break came in 1982 when he was cast as Dr. Jack \"Boomer\" Morrison, a young doctor who struggles as a single parent after the death of his wife, in St. Elsewhere (1982), a medical drama that ran for six seasons. He co-starred as opposite Jodie Foster and young Jena Malone in the Oscar nominated Sci-Fi drama Contact (1997). In 1999, he appeared in Stephen King's The Green Mile (1999), with Tom Hanks. A year later, he played a supporting role as a kidnapped husband of Meg Ryan in Proof of Life (2000). In 2002, Morse became the first English-speaking actor nominated for the Golden Horse Award, the Chinese equivalent of the Oscars, for his superb performance as FBI expert \"Kevin Richter\" in Double Vision (2002). From 2002 to 2004, Morse had a regular gig starring as \"Mike Olshansky\", an ex-Philadelphia policeman turned cab driver, in the TV series Hack (2002) which ran three seasons and was filmed in Philadelphia, close to his home. In 2006-2007, he has a recurring role on season 3 of an Emmy award-winning medical drama House (2004). David Morse has been married to fellow actress Susan Wheeler Duff since 1982. They have three children, one daughter and twin sons. In 1994, after the the Northridge earthquake destroyed his home in Sherman Oaks, Morse moved from LA to Philadelphia with his family, and resides in his wife's hometown.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNjUzOTE1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU4NDQ0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001556","name":"David Morse","idIMDB":"nm0001556"},"actorId":"nm0001556","character":"Ted Arroway","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005790","main":true},{"actorName":"Jodie Foster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000149","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjgyOTQwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDczMzEwNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 November 1962","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Alicia Christian Foster","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Alicia Christian Foster was born in Los Angeles on November 19, 1962. She is the daughter of Evelyn Ella \"Brandy\" (Almond) and Lucius Fisher Foster III, an Air Force lieutenant colonel and later real estate broker. Brandy had filed for divorce in 1959 after having three children with Lucius, but the exes had a brief re-encounter in 1962 which resulted in Alicia's birth. Her older siblings nicknamed her \"Jodie\", a name she has used in her profession. She started her career at the age of two and made commercials for four years before making her debut as an actress in the TV series Mayberry R.F.D. (1968), on which her brother, Buddy Foster, was a regular. She stayed very busy as a child actress, working on television programs such as The Doris Day Show (1968), Adam-12 (1968), The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1969), The Partridge Family (1970), Bonanza (1959), and Gunsmoke (1955). In movies, her roles included playing Raquel Welch's daughter in Kansas City Bomber (1972) and a delinquent tomboy in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974). Jodie first drew attention from critics with her appearance in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) alongside Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, where she played a prostitute at the tender age of 12 (she was 13 when the movie premiered) and received her first Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress. She went on to have a very successful career in her early teens with leading roles in the Disney films Freaky Friday (1976) with Barbara Harris and Candleshoe (1977) opposite veteran film legends David Niven and Helen Hayes. The last film she made during this era was the coming-of-age drama Foxes (1980), before enrolling at Yale University. During her freshman year at Yale, she was attached to a worldwide scandal when a crazed and obsessed fan named John Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan to impress her. Jodie graduated from Yale in 1985 with a degree in literature. She resumed her acting career and sought a breakthrough role that would return her to stardom. After appearing in a few obscure movies with limited release, Jodie landed an audition for Les accusés (1988) and was cast in the part of Sarah Tobias, a waitress who is gang-raped in a bar during a night of partying and teams up with a lawyer played by Kelly McGillis to prosecute the attackers. This performance earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, but despite the Oscar win, Jodie still hadn't re-established herself as a bankable star. Her next film, Catchfire (1990), went straight to video, and she had to campaign hard to get her next good role. In 1991, she starred as Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee assisting in a hunt for a serial killer in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) with Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, Ted Levine, and Brooke Smith. The film was a blockbuster hit, winning Jodie her second Academy Award for Best Actress and establishing her as an international movie star at the age of 28. With the wealth and fame to do anything she wanted, Jodie turned to directing. She made her directorial debut with Little Man Tate (1991), which was followed by Home for the Holidays (1995). These movies were critically acclaimed but did not do well at the box office, and she proved to be a far more successful actress than she was a director. 1994 was a huge triumph for her acting career. She first played a sexy con artist in the successful western comedy Maverick (1994) with Mel Gibson and James Garner. Then, she played title role in Nell (1994), co-starring Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson. For her compelling performance as a wild, backwoods hermit who speaks an invented language and must return to civilization, Jodie was nominated for another Academy Award and won a Screen Actors Guild Award as Best Actress. Although she was working far less frequently as an adult than she did as a child, the films she turned out were commercially successful and critically acclaimed. Her next big screen role was in the science fiction drama Contact (1997) opposite Matthew McConaughey. She played a scientist who receives signals from space aliens. The film was a huge hit and brought her a Golden Globe nomination. She starred in the non-musical remake of The King and I (1956) entitled Anna and the King (1999), which was only modestly received in the U.S. but was very successful overseas. Three years after that she headlined the thriller Panic Room (2002), which co-starred Kristen Stewart, Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam, and Jared Leto. The film was a smash box-office hit and gave Jodie a $30 million opening weekend, the biggest of her career yet. She then appeared in two low-profile projects: the independent film The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys (2002) and the foreign film A Very Long Engagement (2004). She returned to making Hollywood mainstream films, first with Flightplan (2005), in which she played a woman whose daughter disappears on an airplane that she designed. Once again Jodie proved herself to be a box-office draw, and the film was a worldwide hit. The following year she starred in another hit, the bank heist thriller Inside Man (2006) with Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Jodie was on a roll. Her next film was the revenge thriller The Brave One (2007), which once again opened at #1 at the box office and earned her another Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Following this succession of thrillers that all had her playing tough women, Jodie returned to the comedy genre in Nim's Island (2008) with Gerard Butler and Abigail Breslin. She will reunite with Mel Gibson in the upcoming movie The Beaver (2011), which is scheduled for general release in 2011.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjgyOTQwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDczMzEwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000149","name":"Jodie Foster","nicknames":["Jodie F"],"idIMDB":"nm0000149"},"actorId":"nm0000149","character":"Eleanor Arroway","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005786","main":true},{"actorName":"Geoffrey Blake","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0086553","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDI1NDE2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYyNzc4Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 August 1962","placeOfBirth":" Baltimore, Maryland, USA","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Geoffrey Blake is an EMMY nominated, two-time SAG AWARD winning actor best known for his role as 'Wesley' (the abusive radical boyfriend) opposite Robin Wright's 'Jennie' in the iconic Academy Award Best Picture FORREST GUMP. In addition to FORREST GUMP, Blake has appeared alongside Academy Award Winner Tom Hanks in multiple films. Those performances are part of Blake's frequent collaborations with such Academy Award winning filmmakers as Robert Zemeckis and Ron Howard (FORREST GUMP, CONTACT, CAST AWAY, APOLLO 13, EDTV, FROST NIXON) whose films alone have garnered over $2,000,000,000 in Box office. Blake's most critically acclaimed performance was that of the preppy pipe-smoking astrophysicist 'Fisher', the right hand man, in the Sci-Fi classic CONTACT opposite Academy Award winner Jodie Foster. Blake has well over 100 credits to his name in both television and film. In the 1980's and early 1990's, he frequently collaborated with friend and colleague, Emilio Estevez. The two met on the generation defining film YOUNG GUNS where Blake portrayed 'McCloskey', the Young Gun snitch, opposite Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Dermot Mulroney. Blake would go on to make four more films with Estevez as both an actor and director (MEN AT WORK, RATED X, THE WAR AT HOME, NIGHTBREAKER). He also worked with other luminary filmmakers such as Ridley & Tony Scott (THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE, ENEMY OF THE STATE), Paul Mazursky (THE PICKLE), Frank Darabont (MOB CITY), Barry Levinson (WAG THE DOG), Roland Joffe (TEXAS RISING) and numerous others.

Blake came to the production by way of his colleague Bill Paxton, whom he previously worked opposite in APOLLO 13 and MIGHTY JOE YOUNG. Blake portrays 'Col. George Hockley'; confidant, agitate, right hand man and second in command to Paxton's 'General Sam Houston'. Blake relished at the opportunity of working with Paxton again as well with fellow actors Ray Liotta, Olivier Martinez, Brendon Fraser, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and numerous others. Raised in Northern California, Blake sparked his love for acting and writing as a member of The American Conservatory Theatre at the ripe old age of 16. He started his career under the tutelage of John Housman at the USC School of Theatre. He went on to study with legendary acting teacher Peggy Feury at the Loft Studio, where amongst his classmates were his generation's finest actors (Sean Penn, Forrest Whitaker, Meg Ryan, Nicolas Cage, Michelle Pfeifer to name just a few). Later he studied with, often mentioned in Academy Award winner's speeches, Larry Moss. Not only is Blake an award winning actor, he is also a highly respected screenplay writer alongside his scribe partner and wife, Marcia Blake.

His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Scottish, Irish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father's oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film. He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Dazed and Confused (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger. Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham's novel A Time to Kill (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry's hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew's birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998). In 1999, he starred in the comedy Edtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine. In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as Un mariage trop parfait (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Reign of Fire (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Fool's Gold (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies. That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey's career certainly reached it's prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations.

However, he spent most of the next decade in television, regularly appearing in Combat! (1962), The Virginian (1962), Gunsmoke (1955) and 12 O'Clock High (1964). Skerritt's next big break was appearing alongside Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould in Robert Altman's biting satire MASH (1970). Several other film roles quickly followed, before he landed the plum role of Capt. Dallas of the ill-fated commercial towing vehicle Nostromo in the creepy sci-fi epic Alien (1979). Skerritt turned up again in another thriller playing a cop hunting a serial killer in the eerie The Dead Zone (1983), as a Navy Officer Flight instructor in Top Gun (1986) , in the six-chick flick Steel Magnolias (1989), and then as the poster boy for a \"Guess\" Jeans ad campaign utilizing his mature, weather-beaten features. Skerritt didn't neglect his TV background and reappeared on the small screen in Cheers (1982), The China Lake Murders (1990) and picked up an Emmy in 1994 for his performance as Sheriff Brock in the superb series Picket Fences (1992). Skerritt has remained continually busy for the past decade, contributing natural, entertaining and reliable performances in TV series, made-for-TV movies and major theatrical releases. He recreated the role of Will Kane in the TV production of High Noon (2000), and appeared alongside Bruce Willis in the mercenary war drama Tears of the Sun (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY3Mjk5MTMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjUxMTc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000643","name":"Tom Skerritt","idIMDB":"nm0000643"},"actorId":"nm0000643","character":"David Drumlin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005793","main":true},{"actorName":"Henry Strozier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0835231","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3OTc4NDQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxMzg2MjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Henry Strozier is known for his work on Thirteen Days (2000), Damages (2007) and Too Cute!

He is a citizen of the United States, Canada, and Italy. His parents were involved in the arts and instilled in him an appreciation for all things creative. After moving around a bit as a child, he made his way back to New York City and began to study acting.

He then took a break from acting to focus on his early love of fine art, attending the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and receiving a BFA in painting and sculpture. After completing college, Martini began to work steadily in both film and television projects. His film roles were sharing the screen with Tom Hanks and Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan (1998) as \"Cpl Fred Henderson\", Ryan's commanding officer who helped \"Captain Miller\" (Hanks) and his men in the brutal final shootout of the film; and also had roles in some smaller independent films, working with Calista Flockhart in Pictures of Baby Jane Doe (1995), Chris Penn and Jeffrey Wright in Cement (2000) and in the 2000 Sundance Film Festival favorite, Backroads (2000). He also took on a lead role in the Steven Spielberg Emmy-nominated 20 hour mini-series Taken (2002) and has a recurring role with Kiefer Sutherland as \"Agent Steve Goodrich\" on Fox's Emmy-nominated 2nd season of 24 (2001). Other television work includes series regular roles on John Sacret Young's Level 9 (2000), Chris Carter's Harsh Realm (1999) and recurring roles on Breaking News (2002), and the award-winning Canadian series, Da Vinci's Inquest (1998).
