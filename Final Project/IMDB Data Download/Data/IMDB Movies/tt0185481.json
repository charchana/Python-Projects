She delights in the task of putting her own stamp on a character whether it be dramatic, musical, comedic &/or in film, cartoons, v/o, nightclubs, stage, TV, etc. Stuck in a tiny woman's body has always been her challenge since she's always felt much bigger than her under 5' stature & has been recognized for her powerful vocal range playing many nasty yet amusing \"bad ladies\" on & off screen. She has no intention of ever retiring...& continues to dream of working with more of the 'heavy weights' & being cast in meaningful, well received & lucrative projects. Believes acting is a blessed career that can move mountains. It's not for sissies & contains a community of (mostly) evolved, concerned humans. She is proud to have had the modicum of success she has achieved & looks forward to more.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTQ3ODU2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTIxMjI1MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329361","name":"Barbara Goodson","idIMDB":"nm0329361"},"actorId":"nm0329361","character":"Mother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Kramer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0469674","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 December 1950","placeOfBirth":" San Juan Capistrano, California, USA","birthName":"Steven Mark Kramer","bio":"Steve Kramer was born on December 24, 1950 in San Juan Capistrano, California, USA as Steven Mark Kramer.
