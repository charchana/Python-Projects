A native of southern Japan, Shimura was a descendant of the samurai warrior class. Following university training, he founded a theatre company, Shichigatsu-za (\"July Theatre\"). In 1930 he joined a professional company, Kindai-za (\"Modern Theatre\"). Four years later he signed with the Kinema Shinko film studio. He found a niche playing samurai roles for various studios, then signed a long-term contract with Toho Studios in 1943. He appeared in an average of six films a year for Toho over the next four decades. His greatest critical acclaim came in more than 20 roles for Kurosawa, though he is almost as well recognized outside Japan for his kindly doctor role in the original \"Godzilla\" (Godzilla (1954)). Shimura's triumph was his unforgettable performance as a dying bureaucrat in Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952). He continued to act steadily, in good films and bad, almost until his death, culminating with Kurosawa's Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980). He is often described as filling the spot for Kurosawa that Ward Bond filled for John Ford--an ever-present and reliable character player who consistently supplied a solidity and strength to whatever film he appeared in. Shimura was, to be sure, even a finer actor than Bond, and his range was enormous, from \"Ikiru\"'s diffident clerk to the leader of the Seven Samurai in Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954). He died in 1982, a reluctant icon of Japanese cinema.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjY0ODYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg0MTc4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793766","name":"Takashi Shimura","idIMDB":"nm0793766"},"actorId":"nm0793766","character":"Kanji Watanabe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0060626","main":true},{"actorName":"Shin'ichi Himori","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385443","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjE5NTQ1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY2ODMwNw@@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 January 1907","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","birthName":"Kazuo Moriyama","bio":"Shin'ichi Himori was born on January 10, 1907 in Tokyo, Japan as Kazuo Moriyama.

In 1937, he began to study with the Shin-Tsukiji Gekidan (\"The New Tsukiji Theatre Troupe\"). During the Second World War, he served as director of the Bara-Za theatre company. Director Akira Kurosawa saw Chiaki in a stage production of the play \"Dataii\" (from which Kurosawa would later adapt for: The Quiet Duel (1949) ) and advised him to enter films. Chiaki became a favorite of the great director, who cast him in Stray Dog (1949) and nearly a dozen other films. Chiaki was notable as the good-natured Heihachi in Seven Samurai (1954) and as the comic deserter Tahei in _Kakushi toride no san akunin (1958)_. In 1975, Chiaki suffered a stroke. He recovered and in 1985 won Japan Academy Award for Best Actor in Sombre crépuscule (1985).

The handsome young actor portrayed a wide range of characters under the master's guidance. He first played the war-damaged hoodlum Yusa in Stray Dog with antagonism and palpable pain; then, at the opposite end of the spectrum but with equal veracity, Kimura played the innocent, hero-worshiping, faun-like apprentice Katsushiro in Seven Samurai. Although Kimura was 31 when he did the latter role, he looked the part perfectly, and portrayed the wide-eyed teenage warrior with sympathy and passion. After a long film career in film, Kimura founded and directed an acting company which ultimately went bankrupt. He worked arduously for years to pay off all its debts, but shortly after completing this self-imposed task he became ill, and died much too young at 58 years old. It is, therefore, fair to say that Isao Kimura led his life with the same sense of honor that he so often portrayed in his films.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0454087","name":"Isao Kimura","idIMDB":"nm0454087"},"actorId":"nm0454087","character":"Intern","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Masao Shimizu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793674","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 October 1908","placeOfBirth":" Toyko, Japan","bio":"Masao Shimizu was born on October 5, 1908 in Toyko, Japan.
