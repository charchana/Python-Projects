He also played supporting roles in a few films and tv shows. Yuji began to garner attention when he appeared in a 1989 tv romantic comedy called \"Mama Haha Boogie\", opposite Atsuko Asano (101st Marriage Proposal, Abunai Keiji). But it was not until his appearance in the television mini series Tokyo Love Story (1991) in 1991, however, that he became a celebrated star. Since then Yuji has continued to produce the occasional album but has become most known for his impressive acting. Probably his best known role is as the married-to-the-job cop in Odoru daisosasen (1997) and its various incarnations on tv and film. Yuji's hobbies include shooting pool, diving and racing cars in Japan's Class C circuit.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643880","name":"Yûji Oda","idIMDB":"nm0643880"},"actorId":"nm0643880","character":"Izawa Shû","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hitomi Kuroki","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0475878","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 October 1960","placeOfBirth":" Fukuoka, Japan","birthName":"Akiko Egami","height":"5' 4¼\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Hitomi Kuroki was born on October 5, 1960 in Fukuoka, Japan as Akiko Egami.
