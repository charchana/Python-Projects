Born on December 11, 1932, the daughter of a violinist, she originally trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. She gained early experience on the stage with the Highbury Players in Birmingham and moved on to some TV work. The Rank Organization caught sight of her and offered the former beauty queen a seven-year contract. During that time, however, she was pretty much relegated to playing 'nice girl' types in the 50s and 60s. In later career, her film appearances courted controversy and she seemed drawn toward highly troubled, flawed characters. Very popular with Italian audiences, Anne never endeared herself to American filmgoers although she did stir up some curiosity with one of her more noteworthy films, the pioneer lesbian drama Le renard (1967). Starring Anne with Sandy Dennis, the two were quite believable as an unhappy, isolated couple whose relationship is irreparably shattered by the appearance of a handsome stranger (Keir Dullea). At the height of the movie's publicity, Playboy magazine revealed a \"pictorial essay\" just prior to its 1967 release with Anne in a nude and auto-erotic spread. The film won a \"Best Foreign Film\" Golden Globe Award (it was made in Canada) and Anne herself earned a \"Best Actress\" nod. Despite being aggressively promoted in its aftermath by husband/producer Raymond Stross, who was instrumental in reshaping her image with such sexy, offbeat dramas as The Night Fighters (1960), The Very Edge (1963), Ninety Degrees in the Shade (1965), Midas Run (1969), I Want What I Want (1972) and Good Luck, Miss Wyckoff (1979), Anne has remained a distinct European film product. Following her husband's death in 1988, Anne remarried (to a former New York Assistant Attorney General) and begged away from the camera. The couple settled in Beverly Hills.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdmN2NjNTItNTgyOC00NzUxLTllMTktYWVjYWI3YWUzZmViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382391","name":"Anne Heywood","idIMDB":"nm0382391"},"actorId":"nm0382391","character":"Margherita","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Claudio Cassinelli","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144292","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 September 1938","placeOfBirth":" Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy","bio":"Claudio Cassinelli was born on September 29, 1938 in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy.
