Ludivine studied acting as a young girl and had made her movie debut at the age 10 in Les maris, les femmes, les amants (1989). She has established her reputation as one of the brightest young stars in French and international cinema in her collaborations with French filmmaker François Ozon, starting with Gouttes d'eau sur pierres brûlantes (2000) (based on a screenplay by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 8 femmes (2002) and in Swimming Pool (2003). For her performance in 8 femmes (2002), she won a Cesar Award nomination (the French equivalent of the Oscar) and the Romy Schneider Award that is given each year to a promising young French actress. In that film, Sagnier proved her acting prowess by distinguishing herself in a stellar cast that included the legendary actresses Danielle Darrieux, Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Huppert as well as Emmanuelle Béart and Fanny Ardant. Along with these grand ladies of the French cinema, Sagnier won the Best Actress Award from the European Film Academy Award and the Silver Bear Award at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival. Swimming Pool (2003) represented her crossover into English-language cinema. (Sagnier played her first English language role in Rage de dent (2006).) Marketed in the U.S. with a comely shot of Sagnier sunbathing alongside a pool, Ozon's film became one of the biggest-grossing foreign movies in the U.S. during 2003. So far, she has turned down large monetary offers to appear in American films as the foreign girlfriend of young American superstars, as she remains committed to French cinema. Sagnier became a mother on March 25, 2005, when she gave birth to a daughter named Bonnie by her boyfriend, French actor Nicolas Duvauchelle.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjkyNzU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4OTkzOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756203","name":"Ludivine Sagnier","idIMDB":"nm0756203"},"actorId":"nm0756203","character":"Maud","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Julie Ferrier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1922676","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODQ0Njg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwNTMyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR37,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 December 1971","placeOfBirth":" Courbevoie, Hauts-de-Seine, France","bio":"Julie Ferrier was born on December 5, 1971 in Courbevoie, Hauts-de-Seine, France.

Goldberg was born in Santa Monica, California, to Donna (Goebel) and Earl Goldberg. His father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Russia, Lithuania, and Romania), while Adam's mother is a lapsed Catholic who has German, Mexican, Irish, French, and English ancestry. Goldberg made his feature film debut in 1991 as Billy Crystal's younger brother-in-law in Mr. Saturday Night (1992). Additional film credits include Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan (1998) with Tom Hanks, Ron Howard's Edtv (1999), Richard Linklater's ode to 1970s high school life, Dazed and Confused (1993) as well as Waking Life (2001), John Singleton's Higher Learning (1995), Gregory Widen's The Prophecy (1995) opposite Christopher Walken, and lent his voice to George Miller's Babe, le cochon dans la ville (1998). A familiar presence on television, Goldberg's TV credits include Marcus Nispel's made-for-television film Frankenstein (2004) opposite Parker Posey, guest-starring appearances on Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001), The Practice (1997), Will & Grace (1998), and a popular recurring role on Friends (1994).

Caruso's drug noir The Salton Sea (2002) with Val Kilmer, and Ron Howard's Academy Award-winning film A Beautiful Mind (2001) with Russell Crowe. Goldberg co-wrote and directed the feature I Love Your Work (2003), which was produced through his production company. The film, starring Giovanni Ribisi, Franka Potente, Christina Ricci and Joshua Jackson, with a cameo by Elvis Costello, is about the gradual meltdown of a fictional movie star. Goldberg also composed the film's original music with The Flaming Lips' drummer Steven Drozd. Goldberg starred in FOX's comedy, Head Cases (2005) as Shultz, a lawyer suffering from a explosive disorder who insinuates himself into the life of a fellow lawyer (played by Chris O'Donnell) recovering from a nervous breakdown. The two eventually join forces to start a law firm both to take on the cases of underdog clients who need their help, but just as importantly to try to keep each other sane. As a filmmaker, Goldberg wrote, directed and starred in the \"neo-noir\", Scotch and Milk (1998), which made its debut in 1998 at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival, and was featured on the Sundance Channel series \"10 Best Films You May Never Seen.\" In addition, Goldberg directed, co-edited, and produced the comic documentary short, Running with the Bulls (2003) for the Independent Film Channel.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMjM2NTA2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUxMjM1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004965","name":"Adam Goldberg","idIMDB":"nm0004965"},"actorId":"nm0004965","character":"Raoul","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Géczy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311434","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTk2MDk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODc0OTYy._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 August 1964","placeOfBirth":" Georgia, USA","height":"5' 11¾\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Matthew Géczy is an American born movie and television actor, voice actor, and animation voice director based in Paris, France.
