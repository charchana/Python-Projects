She attended several professional schools before making her stage debut at age 12. At 15 she got a job in the chorus line of a London musical and stayed with the show for the next two years, although she took some minor roles in films during that time. She did become well known in the London theatrical scene, but it was the series of \"Carry On\" comedies that made her a star. Although she appeared in only nine films in the long-running series (she left because she thought they were getting too risqué), she made such an impression as the basically goodhearted but dizzy sexpot that many of the series' fans believe she was in many more than she actually was. She almost didn't get the part originally, as she and series regular Kenneth Williams took an instant dislike to each other, but that was soon overcome and they became lifelong friends. After she left the series she continued her stage and film work, and became a regular in a long-running British soap opera, EastEnders (1985) as the matriarch of \"The Queen Vic\" - \"Peggy Mitchell\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDYxODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc1NjcxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934774","name":"Barbara Windsor","nicknames":["The Queen of Carry On","Barb","Little Bird","One-take Windsor","Babs"],"idIMDB":"nm0934774"},"actorId":"nm0934774","character":"Babs Newton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Edward Dentith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219808","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 September 1917","placeOfBirth":" Kings Norton, Birmingham, England, UK","birthName":"Ernest Edward Dentith","bio":"Edward Dentith was born on September 22, 1917 in Kings Norton, Birmingham, England as Ernest Edward Dentith.

Kowin","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"The sexy Barbara Shelley was born Barbara Kowin on February, 13, 1932 in London, England. With her beautiful looks and stature, she worked as a model during her salad days. Her film career began in Italy in the mid-1950s in such tempting fare as New Moon (1955) and Nero's Mistress (1956), but when this seemed like she was going to remain in the minor ranks, she returned to England to attempt to better her career. After appearing in the minor sex farce The Little Hut (1957) with Stewart Granger, David Niven and Ava Gardner, Barbara caught notoriety in the title role of Cat Girl (1957), a low budget production in which she played a woman possessed by a family curse who develops psychic links with a leopard. This paid off and she quickly evolved into a popular Gothic glamour woman at Hammer Studios. Starting things off with The Camp on Blood Island (1958) and Blood of the Vampire (1958), the lovely actress proceeded to stake out her own lucrative territory in the horror genres. Through the 1960s, she co-starred in the classic Village of the Damned (1960), along with The Shadow of the Cat (1961), The Gorgon (1964), The Secret of Blood Island (1965), Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966), Rasputin: The Mad Monk (1966) and Five Million Years to Earth (1967). However, Barbara's film career had fallen aside by the late 1960s and she turned to television. Currently retired, she has pursued interior decorating in recent years. Whether playing female monsters or their intended victims, Barbara played them straight and handled them all with requisite style and grace. For this, she is currently occasionally seen by motion picture fans at conventions as an integral figure of camp horror history.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzMTY4NTg3NzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDI4MDUxNTIx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0791176","name":"Barbara Shelley","nicknames":["The First Leading Lady of British Horror"],"idIMDB":"nm0791176"},"actorId":"nm0791176","character":"Jean Anscombe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1729182","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1729182","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["56 min"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.0","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"16","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0103169","name":"Merton Park Studios"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:15:51"}}
