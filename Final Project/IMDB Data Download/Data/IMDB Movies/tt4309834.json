Well known for his professional skateboarding career in the very pivotal late 80s and early 90s, Lee would go on to pursue acting in 1993. He has worked in film, television, and voiceover, and with such directors as Kevin Smith, Cameron Crowe, Lawrence Kasdan and Brad Bird. Retiring from skateboarding in 1995, Lee has maintained solid ties to the industry, most notably through his partnership with longtime friend and fellow ex-professional skateboarder, Chris Pastras, and their now 25-year-old skate brand, Stereo Skateboards, which Lee co-manages with Pastras. In 2001, Lee dove headfirst into film photography and has been an active photographer and film advocate ever since, having had his work both published and exhibited throughout the years. In October 2016, Lee published a selection of small and large format Polaroid and Fuji instant film photographs spanning a decade as a special limited hardbound issue of Fort Worth-based Refueled Magazine. Only 500 signed and numbered copies were produced, and the issue quickly sold-out. Volume 2 of the 2-volume set, to be released in 2017, will be comprised of 4x5 color photographs made throughout Texas, where Lee currently resides with his wife, Ceren, a textiles and fashion designer, musician and mother. Lee is also the subject of a forthcoming documentary from director Greg Hunt that will take the viewer on the road with him as he exposes his remaining sheets of now-expired 8x10 Polaroid films, a favorite medium of Lee's, and one that is no longer being produced. An accompanying book of the large format Polaroids will be published, with the originals being exhibited. In 2017/2018, Lee will also be publishing and exhibiting selections of B&W slide film photographs that were made over the past 10 years. The print collections, one with its focus primarily on the West and Southwest, and the other being strictly California photographs, will consist of close to 200 combined images. He is also the founder of @filmphotographic, an Instagram film community gallery and resource page. \"It's been an incredible tool for showcasing the work of film photographers from around the world, as well as helping photographers connect,\" says Lee. While acting may come and go, the one constant has been and will continue to be his passion for photography and the ever present drive to grow his body of work. \"It's quite common that a creative person will often have a few outlets or interests or passions, but will gravitate toward one in particular in a unique way. For me, that has been photography, and for almost 16 years now. Not since the skateboarding days have I found something so invigorating, so fulfilling,\" Lee says. \"While I still enjoy acting and being a part of the bigger process, nothing quite compares to individual creative endeavors. And once I got locked into photography, it's really all I think about and desire to do. But I've had some pretty great opportunities as an actor, was able to make some movies for my kids, and have the experience of being on a really unique and enjoyable comedy series. But just as with skateboarding, photography is something much more personal, and more fitting to my creativity. It will always be the driving force.\" Follow Lee on Instagram at @jasonlee, @stereoskateboards, and @filmphotographic","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwOTk2MTMwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE3MDUyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005134","name":"Jason Lee","idIMDB":"nm0005134"},"actorId":"nm0005134","character":"Jack Peterson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Minka Kelly","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1310368","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MzcwNTQyNDJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDMzMzY0NTgx._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 June 1980","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Minka Dumont Kelly","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Minka Kelly was born in Los Angeles, California and she is the only child of former Aerosmith guitarist, Rick Dufay, and Maureen Kelly, an exotic dancer and single mother who often moved with her daughter to different communities before settling in Albuquerque, New Mexico, by the time Minka was in junior high school.

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Jarod grew up as an athlete, excelling in both hockey and basketball. Always the entertainer, Jarod never considered a career in the entertainment industry until a friend pointed out how suited to the business he would be. In 2007, Jarod packed up a few belongings and relocated to Vancouver in hopes of trying his luck as an actor. In a relatively quick manner, Jarod had established himself as a newcomer to watch, securing recurring roles on major American networks. Jarod was first cast in the blockbuster fantasy adventure film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief alongside an all-star cast including Sean Bean and Uma Thurman. This break was soon followed by guest star appearances on FOX's Human Target and AMC's The Killing. Jarod's red-hot career continued to build momentum with recurring roles on ABC's fantasy series Once Upon a Time, the J.J Abrams produced, FOX cult hit show Fringe, The CW's hit drama series The LA Complex and a series regular position opposite Thandie Newton, in DirecTV's original series Rogue. Jarod's star is on the rise and there are no signs of it slowing down. IN 2015, Jarod joined the cast of ABC's summer hit Mistresses for the show's third season and recently returned to shooting The CW's futuristic drama The 100 in the role of fan favorite Nathan Miller. He can also be seen starring as the lead on the Canadian series Coded, a role in which he received a UBCP/ACTRA Awards Best Actor nomination.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0ODE3MjEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI3MTE1OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3523076","name":"Jarod Joseph","nicknames":["Bobby"],"idIMDB":"nm3523076"},"actorId":"nm3523076","character":"Tim McMurray","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michaela Gilchrist","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7093928","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Michaela Gilchrist is known for her work on Away and Back (2015), Incontrol (2017) and Super Speed Dates (2016).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7093928","name":"Michaela Gilchrist","idIMDB":"nm7093928"},"actorId":"nm7093928","character":"Amanda Nethercott","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryan Northcott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0636092","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWU0OWI0N2YtNGRlNi00NzNiLWEzYmItMmU4ZWNkOWI1NjE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIyNzI1NDk@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 April 1980","placeOfBirth":" Calgary, Alberta, Canada","bio":"Ryan Northcott was born on April 9, 1980 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
