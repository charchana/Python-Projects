Vilhelm Passer (seaman). He never did well in school, being the class clown, which had a negative effect on his grades. He did especially badly in mathematics, which came to follow him the rest of his life. When Passer left school he wanted to become an actor, but his father insisted that he should become a seaman like himself. In 1944 he attended maritime school. Life at sea, however, did not go well - he was seasick all the time. After his failure as a seaman he had all kinds of small jobs. In 1946 he made his stage debut with \"Six Comrades [seks kammerater]\" in \"Riddersalen\". In the same year he was accepted in theatre school: De Frederiksbergske Teatres elevskole. After he had completed this education in 1948 he had many small parts in different plays all around Denmark's theatres. He made his film debut in 1947 as an extra in the Danish movie Lucky Journey (1947) and teamed up with Ove Sprogøe in the 1950s in many films. He became famous in 1953 with Ved Kongelunden... (1953), which let all of Denmarksee his his comedic genius. He made many other well-received Danish films, such as Baronessen fra benzintanken (1960), Mig og min lillebror (1967), Summer in Tyrol (1964), the Mafia-movies and Charles' Aunt (1959). Passer worked from 1967 to 1974 at the famous \"Cirkusrevyen på Bakken\", where he was responsible for their greatest success ever. Many of the sketches which he made here were so famous that they even seen all over the world. He made his last film in 1978, Fængslende feriedage (1978).

Like all great comedians he always wanted to play serious parts in movies and plays, but never got the chance. Dirch Passer was without a doubt the greatest Danish comedian ever.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNjI1Nzk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA2MjEyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664850","name":"Dirch Passer","idIMDB":"nm0664850"},"actorId":"nm0664850","character":"Floridor / Celestin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ebbe Langberg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0485999","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 August 1933","placeOfBirth":" Copenhagen, Denmark","bio":"Danish actor Ebbe Langberg was the son of actor Sigurd Langberg and actress Karna Loewenstein-Jensen.
