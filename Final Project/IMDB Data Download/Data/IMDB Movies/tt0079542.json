He returned home in the late 1970s to star as the evil General Zod in Superman II (1980), and in 1984, delivered what many consider his finest performance as the supergrass in Stephen Frears' The Hit (1984). A few minor but colourful roles, topped by his performance as the transsexual Bernadette in Priscilla, folle du désert (1994), have put Stamp back in the British consciousness. His role of a vengeful gangster in The Limey (1999) was created especially for him by its director.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0ODc3ODQ4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIxNzAyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000654","name":"Terence Stamp","idIMDB":"nm0000654"},"actorId":"nm0000654","character":"Prince Lubovedsky","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mikica Dimitrijevic","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0227343","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Mikica Dimitrijevic is an actor, known for Meetings with Remarkable Men (1979).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0227343","name":"Mikica Dimitrijevic","idIMDB":"nm0227343"},"actorId":"nm0227343","character":"Young Gurdjieff","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Athol Fugard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0297538","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 June 1932","placeOfBirth":" Middleburg, Cape Province, South Africa","bio":"Athol Fugard was born on June 11, 1932 in Middleburg, Cape Province, South Africa.

The son of a coal miner, Keir worked in the coal mines from age 14 to 20, at which point he joined the Glasgow Citizen's Theatre to train as an actor. Shortly thereafter, Keir established himself professionally in British theater, television, and film, debuting in The Lady Craved Excitement (1950). His bluff, no-nonsense demeanor was perfect for authoritarian and military roles, especially Roman soldiers, as in Cleopatra (1963), The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), and The Viking Queen (1967). He hooked up with Hammer Productions early on (his debut film) and continued the association in a number of horror films, e.g., Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971). One of his best-known and most popular performances was that of the title role in Five Million Years to Earth (1967). Keir made numerous appearances in television throughout his career, notably in Adam Smith (1972) and in the Australian series The Outsiders (1976). Keir, true to his heritage, frequently played Scotsmen, especially in the latter part of his career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MTE0OTg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgwNTE1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0445139","name":"Andrew Keir","idIMDB":"nm0445139"},"actorId":"nm0445139","character":"Head of Sarmoung Monastery","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sami Tahasuni","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0846664","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Sami Tahasuni is an actor, known for Meetings with Remarkable Men (1979), Stranger and the Fog (1976) and Ballad of Tara (1979).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0846664","name":"Sami Tahasuni","idIMDB":"nm0846664"},"actorId":"nm0846664","character":"Bogga Eddin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fabijan Sovagovic","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0816296","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 January 1932","placeOfBirth":" Ladimirevci, Croatia, Yugoslavia","bio":"Fabijan Sovagovic was born on January 4, 1932 in Ladimirevci, Croatia, Yugoslavia.
