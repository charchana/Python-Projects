With no help from friends, family or mentors, she went out on her own, picked up a trade paper, saw an ad for a casting call and sneaked into an audition. She managed to land a role in Harvey Fierstein's play, \"Spook House\", despite her lack of experience. From there on, Cara's career blossomed. She continued stage work both on and off-Broadway, and started her film career opposite Ethan Hawke and Jeremy Irons in Waterland (1992). Much of her work has been in indie films such as Chutney Popcorn (1999), Happy Accidents (2000), Next Stop Wonderland (1998) and Two Ninas (1999), which she co-produced. As well as acting, Cara has directed, produced and written films, including the short film, Baggage (1997), which starred Liev Schreiber. She co-wrote the screenplay, \"When The Cat's Away\" (1999), with Brad Anderson, and cut a deal with Miramax for a screenplay adaptation of one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's work. Most recently, Cara starred on the final season of the NBC drama, Third Watch (1999), as Grace Foster, a headstrong paramedic with an unbridled ego and the skills to back it up. Cara is a graduate of Columbia University, with a double major in English and Political Science. She got her degree in three years, again helped by her blue-collar work ethic.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzYyODUzMTMzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc5NDg1NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0120648","name":"Cara Buono","idIMDB":"nm0120648"},"actorId":"nm0120648","character":"Dannie Marsh","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0434483","main":true},{"actorName":"Dennis Kleinsmith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1731952","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU3NjEyNjg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYwMDg2Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Dennis Kleinsmith is an actor, known for Morella (2008), Cthulhu (2007) and The Cutter (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU3NjEyNjg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYwMDg2Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1731952","name":"Dennis Kleinsmith","idIMDB":"nm1731952"},"actorId":"nm1731952","character":"Reverend Marsh","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0434484","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Shapiro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1497731","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Njg0OTU2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk1ODQ1OQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 August 1963","placeOfBirth":" Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Joe Shapiro was born on August 2, 1963 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA.
