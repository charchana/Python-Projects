Dignan has hatched a hare-brained scheme for an as-yet-unspecified crime spree that somehow involves his former boss, the (supposedly) legendary Mr. Henry. With the help of their pathetic neighbor and pal Bob, Anthony and Dignan pull a job and hit the road, where Anthony finds love with motel maid Inez.

The son of Laura (Cunningham), a photographer, and Robert Andrew Wilson, an advertising executive, he was raised with two brothers, Owen Wilson (the middle one) and Andrew Wilson (the eldest one). The three would all go on to make their careers in film, with Luke Wilson discovering his love of acting while a student at Occidental College. In 1993, the brothers Wilson collaborated with Wes Anderson to make Bottle Rocket (1994), which was initially a 13-minute short. The gleefully optimistic story of three Texans who aspire to become successful thieves, Bottle Rocket (1994) premiered at the 1993 Sundance Festival, where it attracted the attention of director James L. Brooks. With Brooks' help, the short became a full-length feature film released in 1996 under the same name, Bottle Rocket (1996). Afterwards, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson and the same year, Wilson also appeared in the coming-of-age drama Telling Lies in America (1997). After large roles in three 1998 comedies, Best Men (1997), Bongwater (1998), and Home Fries (1998) (the latter two co-starring Drew Barrymore), Wilson went on to star in another three comedies the following year. The first, Dog Park (1998), was a Canadian film directed by The Kids in the Hall (1988) alum Bruce McCulloch and featured Wilson as one of a group of twenty-something's undergoing the trials and tribulations of love. Blue Streak (1999) starred the actor as the sidekick of robber-turned-policeman Martin Lawrence, while Kill the Man (1999) (which premiered at the 1999 Sundance Festival) cast him as the owner of a small copy centre competing with a large chain store across the street. Though he would stick closely to comedy through 2001 with roles in Charlie's Angels (2000) and Legally Blonde (2001), Wilson took a turn for the sinister in the thrillers Bad Seed (2000) and Soul Survivors (2001) before reteaming with his brother Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson to give one of his most memorable performances as Richie in The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). In 2003, Wilson reprised two past roles, appearing in both Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde (2003). That same year, he also scored a hit as one of the stars of Todd Phillips' Old School (2003). The year 2004 saw Wilson embark on The Wendell Baker Story (2005), a film he starred in, co-directed with brother Andrew Wilson. Although he made his film debut in the acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket (1996), he initially got more recognition for his real-life role as Drew Barrymore's boyfriend than for his acting. Fortunately for Wilson, his onscreen talents outlasted his relationship with Barrymore, and he has enjoyed steady employment and increasing visibility through substantial roles in a number of films","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3MjYxNDk4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ5OTQzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005561","name":"Luke Wilson","nicknames":["One-Take Wilson"],"idIMDB":"nm0005561"},"actorId":"nm0005561","character":"Anthony Adams","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014238","main":true},{"actorName":"Owen Wilson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMzQ4ODYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAwMTc2NQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 November 1968","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","birthName":"Owen Cunningham Wilson","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Self-proclaimed troublemaker Owen Wilson was born in Dallas, to Irish-American parents originally from Massachusetts. He grew up in Texas with his mother, Laura (Cunningham), a photographer; his father, Robert Andrew Wilson, an ad exec; and his brothers, Andrew Wilson (the eldest) and Luke Wilson (the youngest). Expelled from St. Mark's School of Texas (Dallas, TX) in the tenth grade, Wilson finished his sophomore year at Thomas Jefferson School and then headed to a military academy in New Mexico. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he met his future mentor and friend, Wes Anderson. They wrote a screenplay, Bottle Rocket (1996), and sent it to their family friend, screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson, who sent it to producer Polly Platt, who gave it to James L. Brooks, who gave the Texans $5 million dollars to make it into a feature film. Despite critical praise, Bottle Rocket (1996) only grossed one million dollars. After making the film, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson. Fairly quickly, Owen found himself acting in a series of big budget films, such as The Cable Guy (1996), Hantise (1999), Anaconda (1997) and Breakfast of Champions (1999). This led to more work, such as Shanghai Noon (2000), Meet the Parents (2000) and Behind Enemy Lines (2001). He's known not only for his nose, which has been broken several times, but also for his 'free wheeling ways' with a script. He co-wrote the film The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) with his oft partner Wes Anderson. He has been romantically linked with singer Sheryl Crow.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMzQ4ODYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAwMTc2NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562","name":"Owen Wilson","nicknames":["O"],"idIMDB":"nm0005562"},"actorId":"nm0005562","character":"Dignan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014237","main":true},{"actorName":"Ned Dowd","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0235684","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 May 1950","placeOfBirth":" Boston, Massachusetts, USA","bio":"Ned Dowd was born on May 26, 1950 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

At the age of 15 she was bitten by the acting bug, which led her to join a theater group while still finishing her high school years. At 19 she moved to Mexico City to study drama at the National University of Mexico (UNAM) where she learned from teachers Luis de Tavira, Jose Caballero and Ludvik Margules. During her last year in school she auditioned for the role of Tita in Alfonso Arau's \"Like Water for Chocolate\", which would eventually give her international acclaim and recognition around the globe receiving the Best Actress Award at the Tokyo International Film Festival. This led her to pursue a more diverse career in cinema in the U.S., leaving her theater career on hold for a few years, while she was working in independent films such as Wes Anderson's \"Bottle Rocket\" co-starring Owen and Luke Wilson, Allison Anders' \"Sugar Town\", Showtime's \"In the Time of the Butterflies\" with Salma Hayek and Edward James Olmos, among many others. While still maintaining her interest in American cinema, she relocated to Mexico City where she is working on film and theater productions. Her last credits include \"Las Buenrostro\", \"Atlético San Pancho\" and the critically acclaimed short film \"Entre Dos\". Currently she's preparing for an international co-production, due to be shot at the end of 2005 in South America.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNDE0MTQ4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA1NzgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004816","name":"Lumi Cavazos","idIMDB":"nm0004816"},"actorId":"nm0004816","character":"Inez","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014240","main":true},{"actorName":"Julie Mayfield","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0562641","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Julie Mayfield is an actress, known for Bottle Rocket (1996), Upstream Color (2013) and Problem Child (1990).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0562641","name":"Julie Mayfield","idIMDB":"nm0562641"},"actorId":"nm0562641","character":"Wife in Motelroom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0115734","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734","business":{"budget":{"money":"$7,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$124,118","country":"USA","day":"21","month":"02","year":"1996","remarks":"28 Screens"}],"gross":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/1994/\">1994</a>"}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 31 min (91 min)","1 hr 35 min (95 min) (Argentina)"],"soundMix":["Dolby SR","SDDS"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":["Panavision Cameras and Lenses"],"laboratory":["Technicolor, USA (prints)"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.1","metascore":"65","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Hinckley Cold Storage, 4008 Commerce Sreet,.
