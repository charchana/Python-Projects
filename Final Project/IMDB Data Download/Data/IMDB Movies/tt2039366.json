Her mother, Jere, owns a gift basket business and her father, Fred, is a lawyer. Her family is Jewish. When Elizabeth was five her parents enrolled her at Detroit Dance Company. Loving dance, young Elizabeth began to take part in several ballets, including \"Swan Lake\", and, in 1983, starred in some musicals (sometimes singing in Italian). Her screen debut was a role in the TV movie Frog (1987). She then got work as an extra in some TV series, including TV 101 (1988) and Day by Day (1988). In the summer of 1989 she was in Los Angeles and auditioned for a role on Saved by the Bell (1989). She got the role and became a TV star. After four seasons she left the show to try to break into theatrical films. In 1994 she filmed four movies, including Showgirls (1995), and continued to guest-star in popular TV shows, such as Diagnosis Murder (1993). At the same time she was studying English Literature at a college in California. After \"Showgirls\" she signed with United Talent Agency and got some small roles in major films, including The First Wives Club (1996) and Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday (1999), and starred in some indies (Taxman (1998), Last Call (1999), The Real Blonde (1997)). In 1999 she performed on stage in London as Honey in \"Lenny\", opposite Eddie Izzard, and was directed by the legendary Sir Peter Hall. Her performances in Roger Dodger (2002) and Moving Malcolm (2003), two independent movies released in 2002 and 2003, impressed the critics. She made her Broadway debut in \"Sly Fox\" in February 2004, three months after her marriage to New York artist Greg Lauren. She then returned to New York City in the Off-Broadway production \"Hurlyburly\" directed by Scott Elliott and co-starring Ethan Hawke, Parker Posey and Wallace Shawn. She received some of the best reviews of her career for her performance as Bonnie. She appeared for several seasons in the hit series CSI: Miami (2002) as Julia Winston, and in the final season of Showtime's The L Word (2004). Thanks to television syndication of \"Saved By the Bell\", Elizabeth is a favorite among a whole new generation of teen girls. Elizabeth has been making life-changing connections with these girls over the past seven years through Ask Elizabeth, her not-for-profit organization that includes self-esteem workshops she facilitates as a volunteer in schools and for youth organizations, a thriving website (ask-elizabeth.com) that hosts digital content as a way to be of continued service to girls and, most recently, her book \"Ask Elizabeth\" (published by Penguin), which made The New York Times' best-seller list. This nationwide movement has affected the lives of over 100,000 girls and counting. She was also a featured contributor on Oprah.com, bridging the communication gap between mothers and daughters. She and husband Greg Lauren are the proud parents of son Sky Cole Lauren.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMzQyMzkwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY2ODMzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000924","name":"Elizabeth Berkley","idIMDB":"nm0000924"},"actorId":"nm0000924","character":"Holly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jason Gray-Stanford","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0337020","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ3MTcxNzQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE1Nzg5OTE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 May 1970","placeOfBirth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Jason Gray-Stanford was born on May 19, 1970 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

From the moment the doctor announced to the Kummens that they had a baby boy, Mitchell took over the room. By 8 years old Mitchell was a huge Jackie Chan fan and asked his mom how he could meet the star. Mom, focused on the potatoes that she was peeling, threw out the answer \"you'd have to become an actor.\" Little did she know that this is exactly what her young son would head straight out to accomplish. Mitchell's first role came almost immediately through one of the most difficult situations possible, an open casting call. Unaffected by the dozens of children trying out, Mitchell nailed the role of a paperboy in the TV situational comedy 'Less Than Kind'. For the first role of his career the young actor had to catch the star smoking marijuana and so the unusual life of a child actor began. In his second audition Mitchell landed the role of the younger version of Don Cherry, a part in which he was given the strap, another thing that he had never heard of. Then there were the long lingering kisses with Sabrina Carpenter in the feature film 'Horns' as the younger version of Daniel Radcliffe, the outdoor roller coaster ride in a shopping cart in his underwear, and so on ... Mitchell couldn't have ever imagined anything so grand when he first set out to meet Jackie Chan. Mitchell has worked steadily for the past 8 years on every format possible, building a resume of a veteran actor at only 16. Everybody loves this kind, extremely talented teen; casting directors, producers and directors repeatedly request him for their projects. When he isn't on set or doing his home schooling or involved in any number of classes honing his craft, Mitchell can likely be found working hard to support groups fighting to put an end to bullying and the stigma behind mental health issues. Mitchell Kummen is, quite simply, a rarity.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM1YjBlOWUtNGZjMC00MDRlLThkMWItNWIyZDViN2VmMjA4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ5MzEyOTM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3963355","name":"Mitchell Kummen","idIMDB":"nm3963355"},"actorId":"nm3963355","character":"Max","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0407567","main":true},{"actorName":"Mike Bell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068411","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Mike Bell is an actor and writer, known for Goon (2011), My Awkward Sexual Adventure (2012) and Night Mayor (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068411","name":"Mike Bell","nicknames":["The Bear"],"idIMDB":"nm0068411"},"actorId":"nm0068411","character":"Joe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Julia Arkos","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1043218","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1970","placeOfBirth":" Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","bio":"Julia Arkos was born in 1970 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.
