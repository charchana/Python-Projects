She grew up in Kotsche and Dresden and went to the private school Höhere Töchter. At the age of 18 she married Josef Weiser, with whom she had a son in 1922. The family moved to Berlin, where Mr. Weiser opened a cabaret for his wife. There Grethe studied acting and singing, played first at the famous Wintergarten and at the Cabaret der Komiker. Soon she became one of the best German Couplet and Chansonnette singers. Her first silent movie was \"Männer vor der Ehe\" (1927), where she played a mate. Later her husband decided to leave Germany because he was Jewish and so not destroy the career of his wife. After the divorce in 1934 she met film producer Hermann Schwerin and he became her companion. Most of her films were comedies, happy humor films and full of heart. In 1960 she played on stage in Hamburg and in Berlin an der Komödie am Hebbel and at the Renaissance Theater. In 1968 she got an award called \"Verdienstkreuz\" from the German President. She made more than 140 movies and some of her greatest were The Divine Jetta (1937) (\"The Divine Jetta\") (1937), Un grand amour (1942) (\"The Great Love\")(1942) in which she met the great Zarah Leander and became her life long friend, Gabriela (1950) with Zarah Leander, Fanfaren der Liebe (1951) (\"Fanfares of Love\") (1951) which was remade in the USA with Marilyn Monroe as \"Some Like It Hot\", Der Onkel aus Amerika (1953) (\"Uncle from America\") (1953) opposite Hans Moser, and Casino de Paris (1957).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0918780","name":"Grethe Weiser","idIMDB":"nm0918780"},"actorId":"nm0918780","character":"Hannelore Reichmeister, Kurgast aus Berlin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Waltraut Haas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352020","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 June 1927","placeOfBirth":" Vienna, Austria","birthName":"Waltraute Haas","bio":"Waltraut Haas was born on June 9, 1927 in Vienna, Austria as Waltraute Haas.

He was born Curd Gustav Andreas Gottlieb Franz Jürgens on December 13, 1915, in Solln, Bavaria, in Hohenzollern Imperial Germany, a subject of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Of Franco-German parentage, Jürgens -- who was born during the closing days of the second year of the First World War -- would abandon the country of his birth after the end of World War II: Jürgens became an Austrian citizen in 1945 and lived part-time in France. Jürgens entered the journalism profession after receiving his education, and married Louise Basler, an actress. Basler, the first of his five wives, encouraged him to switch careers and become an actor. He learned his new profession on the Vienna stage, which retained his loyalty even after he became an global film star. Jürgens was sent to a concentration camp for \"political unreliables\" in 1944, due to his anti-Nazi opinions. It was this experience in Nazi Germany that led him to become an Austrian citizen after the war. His appearance in The Devil's General (1955) (\"The Devil's General\" (1955)), established him as a star of German cinema, and his role as Brigitte Bardot's older lover in Roger Vadim's ...And God Created Woman (1956) (And God Created Woman (1956)) made him an international star. Always interested in multilingual European actors with good looks and talent, Hollywood beckoned the 6' 4\" Jürgens, casting him in The Enemy Below (1957) as a WWII German U-boat commander in a duel with American destroyer commander Robert Mitchum. He constantly was in demand to play Germany military officers (e.g., The Longest Day (1962), the most expensive black-and-white film ever made) -- indeed, his last role was as \"The General\" in the miniseries Smiley's People (1982) -- and Germanic villains (e.g., \"Cornelius\", the cowardly and treacherous trading company representative, in Lord Jim (1965)) for the rest of his life. One of his most famous roles in the English-language cinema was as the James Bond villain, \"Karl Stromberg\", in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977); it was Moore's favorite Bond film. Jürgens considered himself primarily a stage actor and often performed on the Vienna stage. Though the world knew him as a cinema actor, he also directed several films and wrote several screenplays and an autobiography, \"Sixty and Not Yet Wise\" (1975). His death from a heart attack in 1982 in Vienna was front-page news across Austria and Germany.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg1MTYyODMwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI2NDExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432007","name":"Curd Jürgens","nicknames":["The Norman hulk"],"idIMDB":"nm0432007"},"actorId":"nm0432007","character":"Composer Jack Long","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Oskar Sima","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003267","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRlYjcyNzItYmE0OS00NjU1LThhODItYjQxNGM2ODg0ODc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 July 1896","placeOfBirth":" Hohenau an der March, Austria-Hungary","birthName":"Oskar Michael Sima","bio":"This corpulent, balding character actor was a ubiquitous presence in German-speaking films for almost half a century. So much so, that a contemporary critic referred to him as 'the king of the supporting roles'. A baker's son, Sima had at first aspired to become a writer. When this somehow failed to materialise, he went on to study drama at Vienna Conservatory. His first theatrical engagement in 1919 took him to the Deutsche Theater in Prague. Afterwards, he was to divide his time on stage between Vienna and Berlin. From 1927, Sima came under the auspices of Max Reinhardt, who was astute enough to recognise his singular comic talent and had him cast in satirical or comedic roles. Sima's screen career commenced in 1921. He made limited headway until the arrival of sound. All of a sudden, he started to average several films per year, often acting in commercially successful pictures like Die Fledermaus (1931), Such a Boor (1934), Liebe, Tod und Teufel (1934), Glückskinder (1936), Gasparone (1937), Frau im Strom (1939) and Jenny und der Herr im Frack (1941). His stock-in-trade character was the surly curmudgeon: sometimes villainous, cigar-chewing and choleric, sometimes shifty and scheming, all the while deceptively amiable. At other times, he provided effective, often scene-stealing comedy relief, as pompous, easily deflatable editors, industrialists or burgomasters. Sima continued, unabated, during the post-war era, alternating comedies with romantic melodramas. In 1967, he was forced into retirement following a heart attack, retreating to his horse-breeding stud near Vienna. During the national socialist era, Sima's stance towards the ruling regime seemed ambivalent. On the one hand, he vociferously applauded Austria's 'Anschluss' with Germany. He went as far as to join the NSDAP, ostensibly, in order to continue performing. On the other hand, Sima appears also to have been associated with at least one resistance cell during the 1940's. Perhaps, that curious ambiguity accounted for his receiving the one major award of his prolific career, the Filmband in Gold, only just prior to his death in June 1969.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRlYjcyNzItYmE0OS00NjU1LThhODItYjQxNGM2ODg0ODc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003267","name":"Oskar Sima","idIMDB":"nm0003267"},"actorId":"nm0003267","character":"Metzgermeister Leopold Führinger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Franz Marischka","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0548095","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 July 1918","placeOfBirth":" Unterach am Attersee, Upper Austria, Austria-Hungary [now Austria]","birthName":"Franz Otto Felix Marischka","bio":"Franz Marischka was born on July 2, 1918 in Unterach am Attersee, Upper Austria, Austria-Hungary as Franz Otto Felix Marischka.
