His father was a Red Army veteran of WW2. One of most important contemporary filmmakers, Sokurov worked extensively in television and later graduated from the prestigious film school, VGIK, in 1979. His films often created tensions with the Soviet authorities but he received great support from such outstanding film masters as Andrei Tarkovsky. Particularly, after the collapse of the regime, Sokurov's films started earning him numerous awards around the world. While most known for his feature films, Sokurov has directed over 20 interesting documentaries. His 2002 sensational \"Russian Ark\" is a historic achievement that will be watched and talked about by many generations. Sokurov has collected a number of awards at Berlin, Cannes, Moscow, Toronto, Locarno and European Film Awards. He lives and works in Russia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMTM4MzYzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNjIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0812546","name":"Aleksandr Sokurov","nicknames":["Alexander Sokurov"],"idIMDB":"nm0812546"},"actorId":"nm0812546","character":"Narrator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0297101","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297101","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["48 min"],"soundMix":["Stereo"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":["Betacam SP"],"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.5","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Bojimans Van Beuningen Museum, Rotterdam, Zuid-Holland, Netherlands"}],"awards":[{"award":"European Film Awards 2001","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated European Film Award","categories":[{"category":"European Documentary","names":[{"name":"Aleksandr Sokurov","id":"nm0812546","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"292","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0034023","name":"Idéale Audience"},{"idCompany":"co0017769","name":"Bereg Productions"},{"idCompany":"co0037554","name":"Kasander Film Company"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["night","museum","dark","travel","ship","sea","russia","picture","fog","dutch"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 03:41:59"}}
