His older brother, Dan, was born in 1950. A middle brother died at birth in 1953. His father's job required him to move regularly, which caused Kevin to feel like an Army kid, always the new kid at school, which led to him being a daydreamer. As a teen, he sang in the Baptist church choir, wrote poetry, and took writing classes. At 18, he built his own canoe and paddled his way down the rivers that Lewis & Clark followed to the Pacific. Despite his present height, he was only 5'2\" when he graduated high school. Nonetheless, he still managed to be a basketball, football and baseball star. In 1973, he enrolled at California State University at Fullerton, where he majored in business. During that period, Kevin decided to take acting lessons five nights a week. He graduated with a business degree in 1978 and married his college sweetheart, Cindy Costner. He initially took a marketing job in Orange County. Everything changed when he accidentally met Richard Burton on a flight from Mexico. Burton advised him to go completely after acting if that is what he wanted. He quit his job and moved to Hollywood soon after. He drove a truck, worked on a deep sea fishing boat, and gave bus tours to stars' homes before finally making his own way into the films. After making one soft core sex film, he vowed to not work again if that was the only work he could do. He didn't work for nearly six years, while he waited for a proper break. That break came with The Big Chill (1983), even though his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor -- he was remembered by director Lawrence Kasdan when he decided to make Silverado (1985). Costner's career took off after that.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDU1OTEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI0MTk2MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000126","name":"Kevin Costner","idIMDB":"nm0000126"},"actorId":"nm0000126","character":"Sonny Weaver Jr.","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0425563","main":true},{"actorName":"Deion Sanders","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761521","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 August 1967","placeOfBirth":" Fort Myers, Florida, USA","birthName":"Deion Luwynn Sanders","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Deion Sanders was born on August 9, 1967 in Fort Myers, Florida, USA as Deion Luwynn Sanders.

Raised in Charleston, West Virginia by her mother, Patricia Ann (née English), a retired teacher of English, and her father, William John Garner, a former chemical engineer, Jennifer is the middle sibling of three girls. She spent nine years of her adolescence studying ballet and describes her years in dance as ones characterized by determination rather than talent, being driven mostly by a love of the stage. Jennifer took this determination with her when she enrolled at Denison University as a chemistry major, a decision that was later changed to a drama major when she found that her passions for the stage were stronger than her love of science. New York attracted the young actress after college where she worked as a hostess while pursuing a career in film and television. Her most recent move has been to Los Angeles, a decision that led to a role on the television series Felicity (1998), where she met her future husband Scott Foley. The couple divorced in 2004. Jennifer appeared on the television series, Alias (2001), as \"Agent Sydney Bristow\", who works for the Central Intelligence Agency. For her work, Garner has received four consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She has also received four Golden Globe nominations and won once, as well as received two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and won once. She has appeared in numerous other television production as well as such films as Elektra (2005), 13 Going on 30 (2004), Daredevil (2003), Pearl Harbor (2001) and Dude, Where's My Car? (2000). Aside from filming Alias (2001), Jennifer enjoys cooking, gardening, hiking, and inspired by her character on the series, kickboxing.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4MDgzMTc1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQyMjIwNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004950","name":"Jennifer Garner","idIMDB":"nm0004950"},"actorId":"nm0004950","character":"Ali","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0409300","main":true},{"actorName":"Anthony Rizzo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5804273","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tony Rizzo is the son of late broadcaster Jack Reynolds.
