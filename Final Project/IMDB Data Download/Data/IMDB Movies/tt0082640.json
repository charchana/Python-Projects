She first came to international attention in the early 1970s with Emmanuelle (1974) for director Just Jaeckin. Then two more sequels followed in which she also starred. Included in her credits are a long list of European films including the film Julia (1974), in which she played the lead. In 1979, she came to Hollywood, appearing in The Concorde... Airport '79 (1979) for producer Jennings Lang, who also featured her in the comedy film The Nude Bomb (1980). However, this was all a prelude to the most successful film in Kristel's career -- Private Lessons (1981) -- in which she played the housekeeper who initiates 15-year-old Eric Brown to the wonders of sex. The film grossed over $50,000,000 worldwide. The Dutch actress, who speaks four languages (Dutch, English, Italian and French), now made her home in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Sylvia Kristel died at age 60 of cancer in her sleep on October 18, 2012.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMjUxNDgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg2MTI2OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000482","name":"Sylvia Kristel","idIMDB":"nm0000482"},"actorId":"nm0000482","character":"Lady Constance Chatterley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0026830","main":true},{"actorName":"Shane Briant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108470","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MDQ2MDY0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDExNjky._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 August 1946","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Born in London, Shane Briant topped the Law School at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland.

Her cowboy father moved the family to Hollywood, where he became a chiropractor. As the family needed money, Bessie's mother sent her to Biograph Studios, hoping she would become an actress. D.W. Griffith saw she was pretty and had some acting talent, and put her in several of his films, also giving her a small part in Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages (1916). Bessie became popular with audiences and worked with Douglas Fairbanks in Reggie Mixes In (1916) and William S. Hart in The Aryan (1916). She then moved to Vitagraph and starred in a number of comedy-dramas. In the 1920s she began to act in more mature roles, such as Those Who Dance (1924), and also began working on the stage. She performed the first screen \"Charleston\" dance in The King on Main Street (1925), and gave one of her best performances in Dress Parade (1927). When sound movies came into vogue, she made a number of them and received an Academy Award nomination for The Broadway Melody (1929). By 1931, however, her career was over. She moved to England in 1935 and entertained the troops during World War II. By the 1950s she started playing small roles in movies such as No Highway in the Sky (1951). She played in a handful of low-budget films from the 1950s through the 1970s. In the 1980s she appeared in the big-budget Ragtime (1981) which starred James Cagney, and later that year in Reds (1981) which starred Warren Beatty.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzIwMjU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI0OTg0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0522281","name":"Bessie Love","idIMDB":"nm0522281"},"actorId":"nm0522281","character":"Flora","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Tynan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878983","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"John Tynan is an actor, known for Lady Chatterley's Lover (1981).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878983","name":"John Tynan","idIMDB":"nm0878983"},"actorId":"nm0878983","character":"Roberts","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Huston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404141","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Michael Huston is an actor, known for Lady Chatterley's Lover (1981) and Ed's Next Move (1996).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404141","name":"Michael Huston","idIMDB":"nm0404141"},"actorId":"nm0404141","character":"Footman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fran Hunter","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402810","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Fran Hunter is known for her work on Croupier (1998), Give My Regards to Broad Street (1984) and Mind Games (2001).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402810","name":"Fran Hunter","idIMDB":"nm0402810"},"actorId":"nm0402810","character":"Maid","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Ryan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0584202","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Michael Ryan is an actor, known for It (1990), White Noise 2: The Light (2007) and The Perfect Score (2004).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0584202","name":"Michael Ryan","idIMDB":"nm0584202"},"actorId":"nm0584202","character":"Gigolo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mark Colleano","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171716","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMzY2FiNzYtNmM0MC00ZDZiLWFkYTEtZTM1ODI2MmFlMmRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 March 1955","placeOfBirth":"","birthName":"Mark Sullivan","bio":"Son of American actor Bonar Colleano (1924 - 1958), who died in a tragic road accident in England, and British Rank starlet Susan Shaw (1929 - 1978).
