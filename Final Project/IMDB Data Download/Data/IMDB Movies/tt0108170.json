Deirdre briefly attended UC Riverside but did not graduate. She then moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. In 1996 she became a member of the Screen Actors Guild and primarily worked as a Background Actor in feature film, television, and commercials. Deirdre was a shy girl noted for her long blonde hair and pale features that stood out in over a dozen films such as Rush Hour and Candyman III. In some films such as The Suburbans she was cast for her resemblance to pop singer Cyndi Lauper, a comparison she never relished. During this time she also performed on stage as a performance artist with the Vampire Technology Group which performed on stage at premier Los Angeles Fetish events. Deirdre was both a friend and roommate of fellow actor Louis E. Rosas from 1998-2003. During this time she lost both her parents and slipped into periods of deep depression complicated by her struggles with addiction and her long plagued eating disorder. With her acting career failing to achieved any measurable success, she stopped working in 2002 and slipped into decline. In June of 2003 she gave birth to a son named Damien. DeirdreO'Brien is survived by one elder brother Robert O'Brien. On September 27th 2007, her failing health gave way to a fatal brain aneurysm. Though she was never honest about her age, she died too young. Deirdre O'Brien will continue to live on in film and by those who remember her.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639518","name":"Deirdre O'Brien","idIMDB":"nm0639518"},"actorId":"nm0639518","character":"Mary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Karen Woodley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940356","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Karen Woodley is an actress, known for Flush (2003), Full Frontal (2002) and Screen Two (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940356","name":"Karen Woodley","idIMDB":"nm0940356"},"actorId":"nm0940356","character":"Yvonne Burgess","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pat Laffan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0480783","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MjY3NTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIxNjQxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Pat Laffan is an actor, known for The Queen (2006), Leap Year (2010) and My Left Foot (1989).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MjY3NTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIxNjQxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0480783","name":"Pat Laffan","idIMDB":"nm0480783"},"actorId":"nm0480783","character":"George Burgess","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Virginia Cole","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0170837","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Virginia Cole also played Bridget Cadogan in \"The Irish R.M.\" This popular BBC series was produced in the 1980's.

From a very young age, he loved to learn, especially reading classical text in and outside the classroom. He took great attention to Irish play writers such as Samuel Beckett, which eventually led to him performing in his high school play production of \"Waiting for Godot\", and paying great attention to detail in his high school drama classes. Upon finishing 12th grade, he spent a couple of years with the Dublin Shakespeare Festival, and under the advice of a director there, headed across to London and auditioned for drama schools. Soon to follow, he was invited to audition for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avon, and spent a couple of seasons back in England on the stage. He then, at the age of thirty five, decided to audition for films in the UK and began to build a very respectable resume playing many different diverse characters. He made his debut as a quarryman in The Field (1990). He had several small roles in major Hollywood movies based in Ireland, such as Far and Away (1992) and Le cheval venu de la mer (1992). Memorably played historical Irish figure \"Michael Collins\" in The Treaty (1991). Made his breakthrough in Scottish themed Braveheart (1995), which was largely filmed in Ireland, opposite Mel Gibson. He played Gibson's right-hand man \"Hamish\". Since then, he has appeared in numerous major films such as Mission: Impossible II (2000), Lake Placid (1999), Turbulence (1997). He has made a name for himself taking the titular role in The General (1998), based on the life of Irish criminal \"Martin Cahill\", for which he won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award. He appears in director John Boorman's film The Tailor of Panama (2001) as well as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). Ever since, he has continued to bring his huge stage presence to the screen, always delivering the character in full development to his audience. He is married to his lovely wife, Mary, since 1982. They have four sons.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3NTMxODI0OTBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ1NTY5Mjc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322407","name":"Brendan Gleeson","idIMDB":"nm0322407"},"actorId":"nm0322407","character":"Lester","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0108170","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108170","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"SEK","country":"6,573,190","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 31 min (91 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.66 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.2","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Ardmore Studios, Herbert Road, Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland"}],"rated":"R","awards":[{"award":"Golden Globes, USA 1994","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Golden Globe","categories":[{"category":"Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture -
