A group of young friends go on a camping trip in the countryside, where Ken encounters a mysterious woman near a grave. Afterward, Ken's life is changed forever as he becomes a victim of ghost meddling. As the friends journey back to Hong Kong without Ken, another sinister story takes place.

The outcome of this second story leads to Ken's friend Jojo being courted by a ghost, and ultimately leads to the final story where Peter Butt unknowingly visits a haunted theater with some of Ken's friends.","simplePlot":"This Chinese ghost film centers on the theme of the haunted streets in Hong Kong, where four loosely connected stories are depicted.
