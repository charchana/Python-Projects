When John accidentally discovers a hidden compartment in the barn, he finds a creepy scarecrow but his son Michael makes him promise to destroy it. However, his neighbor Jude Weatherby visits him, gives a six-pack of beer to the abstemious John and convinces him to put the scarecrow in the cornfield. Out of the blue, the life of John changes: the crows die; the pump works again irrigating the land; and the banker responsible for the closure has an accident and dies. However, he feels that his land is possessed by something evil that is threatening his beloved family.","simplePlot":"Doing what he believes must be done in order to save his family and livelihood, farmer John Rollins places an odd scarecrow among his crops and promptly reaps the benefits.

He is of Italian (from his paternal grandmother), English, Scottish, and Irish descent. Norman's first film was in Guillermo del Toro's 1997 horror thriller Mimic (1997), where he played the character Jeremy. He has also played roles in the films \"Floating\", Six Ways to Sunday (1997), Deuces Wild (2002), Blade II (2002), \"Gossip\", 8 mm (1999), American Gangster (2007), Hero Wanted (2008) and Moscow Chill. In 2005 he had a bit-part in Christian Alvart's Antibodies (2005) as a German policeman. In 2008 he starred in _Red Canyon_. Norman is perhaps best known for playing the role of Murphy MacManus in the 1999 movie The Boondock Saints (1999) opposite Sean Patrick Flanery and Willem Dafoe. He also starred opposite Flanery in the 2009 sequel The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day (2009). He appeared at the 2012 Comic-Con in San Diego. As of 2010 he stars as Daryl Dixon in the AMC television series The Walking Dead (2010). The character was not originally in the comic book series of the same name, but was created specifically for Reedus after his audition for the character of Merle Dixon. The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman has stated he feels \"absolutely blessed [Reedus] has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A lot of Norman's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season.

He is of German and Irish descent. Richard attended the University of Notre Dame, where he became heavily involved with the University Theatre. Appearing in such productions as \"Luther\", \"Antigone\", \"Rhinoceros\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\", he also took on the task of stage manager on many of these productions, and it was not unusual to find him helping to build the sets or manage the costumes during this period. Graduating with a B.A. (cum laude) in 1970, Richard traveled to Salzburg and Innsbruck to study German, a language in which he is fluent. Progressing to Academy of Dramatic Art in Rochester, Michigan, Richard has had extensive experience as a stage actor, as well as teaching acting, and made his Broadway debut in 1986 with \"Execution of Justice\". One of his major triumphs in the theatre has been alongside Kevin Spacey in the acclaimed 1999 revival of O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\", in which he played the drunken, corrupt ex-cop Pat McGloin. Brief appearances in Rooster Cogburn, The Duchess and Dirtwater Fox, Joy Ride, and Twice in a Lifetime, as well as in such TV fare as Escape From Hell (1977), Joe Kennedy: The Forgotten Kennedy (1977), and the NBC series \"Hot Pursuit\" (1984) have disguised an expanding repertory theatre portfolio. Richard has also contributed to such diverse undertakings as Bay Area Radio's Eugene O'Neill Project (playing Smithers to Joe Morton's Brutis Jones in \"The Emperor Jones\") and the Adams-Jefferson Project of Carleton College, participating in a series of recordings of the correspondence between the two US Presidents. To this day, Richard has maintained his involvement in theatre workshops and encouraging the dramatic arts under the auspices of the Mark Taper Forum and A.S.K. However, since his scene-stealing cameo as the Quartermaster in 1989's Glory, with his trademark bushy mustache and heavyset frame, Richard has acquitted himself as one of the best, and busiest, character players on TV and in the movies.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNDgyMDcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkwNjY0MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0726223","name":"Richard Riehle","idIMDB":"nm0726223"},"actorId":"nm0726223","character":"Jude Weatherby","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0186121","main":true},{"actorName":"Darcy Fowers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1375085","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Darcy Fowers is an actress, known for Bruce Almighty (2003), Messengers 2: The Scarecrow (2009) and All About Steve (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1375085","name":"Darcy Fowers","idIMDB":"nm1375085"},"actorId":"nm1375085","character":"Miranda Weatherby","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0186122","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew McNulty","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2439913","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMDkyMDQ5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyNTQxMjE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 December 1982","placeOfBirth":" Manchester, England, UK","birthName":"Michael Anthony McNulty","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Matthew McNulty was born on December 14, 1982 in Manchester, England as Michael Anthony McNulty.
