Her father is Greek, and her mother was of English, Irish, Scottish, and Italian descent. Jennifer spent a year of her childhood living in Greece with her family. Her family then relocated to New York City where her parents divorced when she was nine. Jennifer was raised by her mother and her father landed a role, as \"Victor Kiriakis\", on the daytime soap Days of Our Lives (1965). Jennifer had her first taste of acting at age 11 when she joined the Rudolf Steiner School's drama club. It was also at the Rudolf Steiner School that she developed her passion for art. She began her professional training as a drama student at New York's School of Performing Arts, aka the \"Fame\" school. It was a division of Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and the Arts. In 1987, after graduation, she appeared in such Off-Broadway productions as \"For Dear Life\" and \"Dancing on Checker's Grave\". In 1989, she landed her first television role, as a series regular on Molloy (1989). She also appeared in The Edge (1992), Ferris Bueller (1990), and had a recurring part on Herman's Head (1991). By 1993, she was floundering. Then, in 1994, a pilot called \"Friends Like These\" came along. Originally asked to audition for the role of \"Monica\", Aniston refused and auditioned for the role of \"Rachel Green\", the suburban princess turned coffee peddler. With the success of the series Friends (1994), Jennifer has become famous and sought-after as she turns her fame into movie roles during the series hiatus.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk1MjIxNjUxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2NzM4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000098","name":"Jennifer Aniston","nicknames":["Jen","Jenny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000098"},"actorId":"nm0000098","character":"Annie Hughes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010772","main":true},{"actorName":"Harry Connick Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001065","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNjg0MTExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4MTcxMDE@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 September 1967","placeOfBirth":" New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","birthName":"Joseph Harry Fowler Connick Jr.","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Joseph Harry Fowler Connick, Jr. was born in New Orleans, Louisiana.

His father is of Irish, English, and German ancestry, and his maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Vienna, Austria and Minsk, Belarus. Harry, Jr.'s mother died of ovarian cancer when he was 13. His parents owned a record store and encouraged their son's interest in music - piano at age three, with a New Orleans jazz band aged ten. He won piano competitions while playing French Quarter clubs and attending the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts. At eighteen, he studied at New York's Hunter College and later on at the Manhatan School of Music. At nineteen, he released his first album for Columbia Records and began an extended run performing at the Algonquin's Oak Room, followed a year later by his second album. He wrote the score and sang several songs for Rob Reiner's When Harry Met Sally... (1989), the soundtrack for which went multi-platinum. So far, while bringing back swing and big band music, he has earned one gold, four platinum and three multi-platinum albums, plus two Grammies.

He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager, in an artist's housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\". His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel. Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called Multi-Facial (1995), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. Multi-Facial (1995) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception. Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, Strays (1997). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. Steven Spielberg was impressed by Multi-Facial (1995) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in Saving Private Ryan (1998). Multi-Facial (1995) earned Vin more work, when the director of The Iron Giant (1999) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career has steadily grown, with him securing his first lead role as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film Pitch Black (2000). The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves. Since then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002), Baby-sittor (2005), Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), and Furious 7 (2015). He also voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and starred in the lower-budgeted courtroom drama Jugez-moi coupable (2006), the latter directed by Sidney Lumet.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNzA4MDYxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI1MDAxOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874","name":"Vin Diesel","idIMDB":"nm0004874"},"actorId":"nm0004874","character":"The Iron Giant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010773","main":true},{"actorName":"James Gammon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304000","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MzIxNDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA3NDYyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 April 1940","placeOfBirth":" Newman, Illinois, USA","birthName":"James Richard Gammon","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Rugged-looking James Gammon first broke into the entertainment industry not as an actor but as a TV cameraman.

After graduating from high school, Leachman attended Illinois State University and Northwestern University, where she majored in drama. After winning the title of Miss Chicago 1946 (as part of the Miss America pageant), she acted with the Des Moines Playhouse before moving to New York. Leachman made her credited debut in 1948 in an episode of The Ford Theatre Hour (1948) and appeared in many television anthologies and series before becoming a regular on The Bob & Ray Show (1951) in 1952. Her movie debut was memorable, playing the doomed blonde femme fatale Christina Bailey in Robert Aldrich's classic noir Kiss Me Deadly (1955). Other than a role in Rod Serling's movie The Rack (1956) in support of Paul Newman, Leachman remained a television actress throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, appearing in only two movies during the latter decade, The Chapman Report (1962) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Though she would win an Oscar for Peter Bogdanovich's adaptation of Larry McMurtry's The Last Picture Show (1971) and appear in three Mel Brooks movies, it was in television that her career remained and her famed was assured in the 1970s and into the second decade of the new millennium. Leachman was nominated five times for an Emmy Award playing Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary Tyler Moore's landlady and self-described best friend on Mary Tyler Moore (1970) and on the spin-off series Phyllis (1975). She won twice as Best Supporting Actress in a comedy for her \"Mary Tyler Moore\" gig and won a Golden Globe Award as a leading performer in comedy for \"Phyllis\", but her first Emmy Award came in the category Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in 1973 for the television movie A Brand New Life (1973). She also won two Emmy Awards as a supporting player for Malcolm in the Middle (2000). She was married to director-producer George Englund from 1953 to 1979.

Emmet Walsh has made a solid career of playing corrupt cops, deadly crooks, and zany comedic roles since the early 1970s. Michael Emmet Walsh was born in Ogdensburg, to Agnes Katharine (Sullivan) and Harry Maurice Walsh, a customs agent. He is of Irish descent. Walsh first appeared in a few fairly forgettable roles both on TV and onscreen before cropping up in several well remembered films, including a courtroom police officer in What's Up, Doc? (1972), as the weird Dickie Dunn in Slap Shot (1977), and as a loony sniper hunting Steve Martin in The Jerk (1979). On-screen demand heated up for him in the early 1980s with attention-grabbing work in key hits, including Brubaker (1980), Reds (1981), and as Harrison Ford's police chief in the futuristic thriller Blade Runner (1982). Walsh then turned in a stellar performance as the sleazy, double-crossing private detective in the Joel Cohen and Ethan Coen film noir Blood Simple. (1984), and showed up again for the Coens as a loud-mouthed sheet-metal worker bugging Nicolas Cage in the hilarious Raising Arizona (1987). As Walsh moved into his fifties and beyond, Hollywood continued to offer him plenty of work, and he has appeared in over 50 movies since passing the half-century mark. His consistent ability to turn out highly entertaining portrayals led film critic Roger Ebert to coin the \"Stanton-Walsh Rule,\" which states that any film starring Walsh or Harry Dean Stanton has to have some merit. And the \"M\" stands for Michael!","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjgyNzgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA2MTM0OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001826","name":"M.
