A good student, Ving entered the New York High School of Performing Arts, where he discovered his love of acting. He studied at the Juilliard School of Drama, and began his career in New York theater and in Shakespeare in the Park productions. He first appeared on Broadway in the play \"The Winter Boys\", in 1984. Also that year, he appeared in front of the cameras for the first time in the TV movie American Playhouse: Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), and was then quickly cast in minor roles in several popular TV shows, including Miami Vice (1984), Tour of Duty (1987) and Crime Story (1986). Ving continued his rise to fame through his work in soap operas. His big break came in 1994 when director Quentin Tarantino cast him as the merciless drug dealer Marsellus Wallace in the mega hit Pulp Fiction (1994). Not long after, director Brian De Palma cast Rhames alongside Tom Cruise as the ace computer hacker, Luther Stickell in Mission: Impossible (1996). With solid performances in both these highly popular productions, his face was now well known to movie goers, and the work offers began rolling in more frequently. The next career highlight was playing the lead role in the HBO production of Don King: Only in America (1997). Rhames' performance as the world's most infamous boxing promoter was nothing short of brilliant, and at the 1998 Golden Globe Awards he picked up the award for Best Actor in a MiniSeries. However, in an incredible display of compassion, he handed over the award to fellow nominee Jack Lemmon, as he felt Lemmon was a more deserving winner! The talented actor then contributed attention grabbing performances in Bringing Out the Dead (1999), returned as Luther Stickell in Mission: Impossible II (2000), contributed his deep bass voice for the character of Cobra Bubbles in Lilo & Stitch (2002), and played a burly cop fighting cannibal zombie hordes in Dawn of the Dead (2004). A keen fitness & weight lifting enthusiast, Rhames is also well known for his strong spiritual beliefs and benevolent attitude towards other people. In a remarkable turn of events, whilst filming The Saint of Fort Washington (1993) in New York, he was introduced to a homeless man, who turned out to be his long lost, older brother, Junior, who had lost contact with the family after serving in Vietnam. The thrilled Rhames immediately assisted his disheveled brother in getting proper food & clothing, and moving him into his own apartment.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMTgyMzc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjE5Mjk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000609","name":"Ving Rhames","idIMDB":"nm0000609"},"actorId":"nm0000609","character":"Carruthers","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ava Gaudet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2398335","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczODY2NTk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzczMzAxMDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Ava M.

His first complete film project was the ultra-low budget student film \"Brother John.\" As a young graduate of film school Dutcher poured everything he had into making his first feature-length film, the romantic comedy \"Girl Crazy.\" Although \"Girl Crazy\" was never screened theatrically, Dutcher did sell the picture to HBO, and was able to recoup his expenses. In 1997 Dutcher directed \"Eliza and I\", a play-like film based adapted from the play by BYU professor/actress/playwright Elizabeth J. Hansen, which was shown on public television and is available on video. Although he knew what he wanted to do, and he was certain he had the skill and experience to be able to do so, it took Dutcher three years to raise enough money to make a feature film about Latter-day Saints. Eventually Dutcher raised enough money to commence filming. \"God's Army\" was made with a budget of $300,000, a paltry sum by today's movie-making standards. But after it was released in Utah it became the second-highest grossing film in the state for that year. \"God's Army\" went on to be shown in theaters all over the country. It ended up grossing over $2.6 million in U.S. box office sales, and then sold over $2.5 million in videos and DVDs in the first year of video release. With the critical and financial success of \"God's Army\", Dutcher was easily able to raise money for this next film project. \"Brigham City\" opened in Utah theaters on April 6, 2001. It eventually played in theaters around the country. Critics generally considered it an even better film than \"God's Army.\" But its darker subject matter (the plot revolves around the sheriff's search for a serial killer), as well as its PG-13 rating seemed to keep some movie-goers away. On April 19 2001, just two weeks after the release of \"Brigham City\", anticipation was high as newspaper and TV reporters crowded the Bombay Room in Salt Lake City's Hotel Monaco. It was here that Dutcher announced the subject of his next film. He would make a movie about Joseph Smith, Jr., the first prophet and founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE0ODYzODQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3Nzc3NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244756","name":"Richard Dutcher","nicknames":["Father of Mormon Cinema"],"idIMDB":"nm0244756"},"actorId":"nm0244756","character":"Martineau","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marie Westbrook","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1996362","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Marie Westbrook was born in the small mining town of Kellog, Idaho, and was raised in Soda Springs ID, close to 'Ligertown', a collection of dilapidated shacks where a local eccentric kept wild ligers (and yes, in case you were wondering, Ligertown was the inspiration for the liger theme in Napoleon Dynamite which was set in nearby Preston). She was involved in dance and gymnastics from the age of seven, initially enrolling at Utah State University as a dance major, she changed gears and graduated with a degree in Physics/Chemistry Education. After waiting tables, working as a physics TA and laser beam operator, she taught 8th Grade science for a year. Marie is also one of few Hollywood actresses who can list 'professional treadmill tester' on her resume. From an early age Marie made movies of herself performing spoof commercials, talk shows and plays with her friends. She was persuaded by a family friend to try her hand at modeling and is known and loved by discerning beer-drinkers in Utah, Idaho and Colorado as the girl on the Provo Girl Pilsner label. She then decided to focus on acting, studying and becoming part of the local acting community all while finishing her degree. She worked in several independent shorts and student films before she was cast in Paradise alongside David Strathairn and Barbara Hershey. Her days testing treadmills now firmly behind her, Marie moved to Los Angeles in fall of 2005 to pursue an acting career. Her willowy beauty and natural talent earned her prominent roles in a number of independent films; she plays a lead along with Ving Rhames in the forthcoming supernatural thriller Evil Angel and has recently been voicing characters on the much anticipated video game, Star Wars: The Old Republic.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1996362","name":"Marie Westbrook","idIMDB":"nm1996362"},"actorId":"nm1996362","character":"Jenny","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jontille Gerard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2523685","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDAwNTMxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjExMDEwMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Jontille Gerard is an actress, known for Fig (2011), Blood and Bone (2009) and Beyond the Pretty Door (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDAwNTMxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjExMDEwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2523685","name":"Jontille Gerard","idIMDB":"nm2523685"},"actorId":"nm2523685","character":"Josie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bart Johnson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424559","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MzA4Mzg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEzMDgyMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1970","placeOfBirth":" Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Barton Robert Johnson","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Bart Johnson was born on December 13, 1970 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA as Barton Robert Johnson.

Halford cut his teeth in the Sundance Filmmaker Labs where he worked as a 'stock' actor for several seasons. The Sundance Labs granted him the opportunity to work with a number of A-list talent as well as ascending directors, actors, and producers. Many of the productions were award winning and earned critical accolades. Since honing his craft in Park City, Halford forged a name for himself on the small screen with credits in a number of high-profile television productions. He leant his imposing physicality in recent work as the towering, meth-cooking serial killer suspect, Reggie LeDoux, on HBO's hit series True Detective (2014) alongside Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Halford has made an appearance in ABC's hit program Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013) as Agent Shaw. Other recent credits include ABC's Body of Proof (2011), NBC's The Event (2010), and Vegas (2012) on CBS. Halford's film credits include a notable scene opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins in The World's Fastest Indian (2005).
