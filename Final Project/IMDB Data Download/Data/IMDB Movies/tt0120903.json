He was a member of various local drama groups from about age 12. He left school at age 15 to work as a junior reporter on a local paper; he quit when his editor told him he was spending too much time at the theatre and not enough working. Stewart spent a year as a furniture salesman, saving cash to attend drama school. He was accepted by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 1957. He made his professional debut in 1959 in the repertory theatre in Lincoln; he worked at the Manchester Library Theatre and a tour around the world with the Old Vic Company followed in the early 1960s. Stewart joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1966, to begin his 27-year association. Following a spell with the Royal National Theatre in the mid 1980s, he went to Los Angeles, California to star on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), which ran from 1987-1994, playing the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his sister Jean to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theater, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by William Shakespeare, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre. When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theater festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Laurence Olivier, Wendy Hiller, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Paul Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest. McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher's \"section 28\" legislation which would make the \"public promotion of homosexuality\" a crime. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand, and he has been active in the Gay Rights movement ever since. Ian resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in acclaimed stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received Richard III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Apt Pupil (1998) and Gods and Monsters (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps on 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as _King Lear (2008)_ directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and Noël Coward's \"Present Laughter\", as well as Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" and Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\", both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias. McKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in X-Men (2000) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, which he reprised in The Hobbit trilogy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjgyNjk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA3NTY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005212","name":"Ian McKellen","idIMDB":"nm0005212"},"actorId":"nm0005212","character":"Eric Lensherr / Magneto","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0188772","main":true},{"actorName":"Famke Janssen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000463","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5MjU2NTQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAzODU1Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 November 1964","placeOfBirth":" Amstelveen, Noord-Holland, Netherlands","birthName":"Famke Beumer Janssen","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Famke Janssen was born on November 5, 1964 in Amstelveen, Netherlands, and has two siblings, director Antoinette Beumer and actress Marjolein Beumer.

Later, taking a break from modeling, she majored in writing and literature at Columbia University and studied acting with Harold Guskin. She then went to Los Angeles, California, where she continued to study acting under Roy London. Her first film was the crime drama Fathers & Sons (1992), where she played the love interest of Jeff Goldblum. Later, she became James Bond's enemy in GoldenEye (1995) opposite Pierce Brosnan. Famke received strong critical acclaim for her electrifying performance as the femme fatale Xenia Onatopp. Her career has bloomed since then with her starring in such films as House on Haunted Hill (1999), a reoccurring role on FX's Nip/Tuck (2003) and the blockbuster trilogy X-Men (2000), X-Men 2 (2003), and X-Men: L'affrontement final (2006).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5MjU2NTQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAzODU1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000463","name":"Famke Janssen","idIMDB":"nm0000463"},"actorId":"nm0000463","character":"Jean Grey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001170","main":true},{"actorName":"James Marsden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005188","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTUzNjc0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYyMDYzMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 September 1973","placeOfBirth":" Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA","birthName":"James Paul Marsden","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"James Paul Marsden, or better known as just James Marsden, was born on September 18, 1973, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to Kathleen (Scholz) and James Luther Marsden. His father, a distinguished Professor of Animal Sciences & Industry at Kansas State University, and his mother, a nutritionist, divorced when he was nine years old. James grew up with his four other siblings, sisters, Jennifer and Elizabeth, and brothers, Jeff and Robert. He has English, German, and Scottish ancestry. During his teen years, he attended Putnam City North High School which was located in Oklahoma City. After graduating in 1991, he attended Oklahoma State University and studied Broadcast Journalism. While in university, he became a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. While vacationing with his family in Hawaii, he met actor Kirk Cameron, and his actress sister, Candace Cameron Bure. They eventually invited James to visit them in Los Angeles. After studying in Oklahoma State for over a year and appearing in his college production, \"Bye Bye Birdie\", he left school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his interest in acting. James got his first job on the pilot episode of The Nanny (1993) as Eddie, who was Margaret Sheffield's boyfriend. He then became part of the Canadian television series, Boogies Diner (1994), which aired for one season. After that series ended, he got a brief role as the original Griffin on Fox's Party of Five (1994). His first big break came when he became the lead on the short-lived ABC series, Second Noah (1996). Although the show didn't last long, the young actor received enough exposure from the public and even managed to win the hearts of fellow teenage girls. In 1996, he attended an audition for a movie titled Primal Fear (1996) but unfortunately lost that role to Edward Norton. Two years later, he was offered a lead role in 54 (1998), which he turned down. The role later went to another actor, Ryan Phillippe. James' star power increased when he starred in David Nutter's Comportements troublants (1998), alongside Katie Holmes and Nick Stahl, which had mixed reviews, but mostly positive ones. His role in the television series as Glenn Foy in Ally McBeal (1997), is probably one of his biggest achievement to date. He became one of the main cast members during the first half of season 5, where he showcased his singing abilities. It was in that show where he was able to grab the attention of audiences from different backgrounds. The 5' 10\" star later played Lon Hammon Jr. in the romantic movie, The Notebook (2004), which was based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks of the same name. His movies, Lies & Alibis (2006) and 10th & Wolf (2006) was also released around the world to audiences in the year 2006. One of his most memorable roles to fans is his role as Cyclops in the X-Men (2000) movie franchise. The movie was well accepted by audiences and critics, which eventually made James one of the hottest stars since it was released. He was among the actors who starred in all three of the X-Men movies. James had the honor of working alongside Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen and Hugh Jackman in the film. However, not many people know that he actually had to wear lifts for most of his scenes in the X-men movies, because his character Cyclops is supposed to be 6\" 3\" compared to a 5' 3\" Wolverine. In reality, he is actually under 6' 0\", shorter than Famke Janssen who plays his love interest, Jean Grey, and even shorter than Hugh Jackman who played Wolverine. In the year 2006, he played Richard White in the highly anticipated movie, Superman Returns (2006), which coincidentally was directed by Bryan Singer, who also directed previous X-Men installments. Although he appeared in X-Men: L'affrontement final (2006), the third installment of the X-Men franchise, many would notice that he in fact had more screen time in 'Superman Returns', as Lois Lane's long awaiting fiancé who had to accept the fact that his fiancée is in love with the man of steel. James earned great reviews from that movie, which led to him getting more movie roles. In 2007, James played Corny Collins in the film Hairspray (2007), an adaption of the Broadway musical based on John Waters movie, Hairspray (1988). He joined a star-studded cast, starring alongside top names such as John Travolta, Queen Latifah and Michelle Pfeiffer. James not only acted in that movie, but also sang two of the film's songs, \"The Nicest Kids In Town\", and \"Hairspray\". Being part of Hairspray catapulted James to a different level of stardom as audiences got to see another side of him. His next role was in the Disney movie, Enchanted (2007), playing Prince Edward, where he acted alongside Amy Adams, Susan Sarandon and Patrick Dempsey. Once again, James had the opportunity to sing in two songs from the movie, \"True Love's Kiss\" and \"That's Amore\". Enchanted (2007) appealed to not only older audiences but also to those who were fans of Disney's network productions. Following his huge success in the years 2006 and 2007, James played the male lead role in the romantic comedy, 27 Dresses (2008), opposite actress Katherine Heigl in 2008. The movie did well at the box office, earning a gross revenue of over $159 million, which exceeded the expectations of crew members especially since it was under a $30 million budget. Marsden played the male lead in the horror film, The Box (2009), based on the 1970 short story \"Button, Button\" by author Richard Matheson. He starred opposite Cameron Diaz in the movie. He co-starred in Accidental Love (2015) (previously Accidental Love (2015), a politically-themed romantic comedy, directed by David O. Russell and filmed in Columbia, South Carolina. Marsden's recent film roles include the sequel comedy Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013), the romantic drama The Best of Me (2014), and the comedy Unfinished Business (2015). James was married to Lisa Linde, an actress known from her role in Days of Our Lives (1965). Lisa is the daughter of legendary country music songwriter Dennis Linde. The couple wed on July 22, 2000 and have a son, Jack Holden Marsden who was born on February 1, 2001, and a daughter, Mary James, who was born on August 10, 2005. They divorced in 2011. James has another son, born in 2012, with model Rose Costa. Many would assume that with all this success achieved by James at this age, he would be somewhat high-headed but James mentioned that despite all the attention he's getting from the public eye, he tries to keep himself as grounded as possible. He even admits that he flies coach instead of first class while traveling with his family. In an interview he mentioned that he believes he has a certain responsibility to let his children know that he isn't special because of what he does, but who he is as a person. With a great humble attitude and a bright future ahead of him, there's definitely more to expect from this Oklahoma native.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTUzNjc0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYyMDYzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005188","name":"James Marsden","nicknames":["Bello Jimmy","J.

Halle first came into the spotlight at seventeen years when she won the Miss Teen All-American Pageant, representing the state of Ohio in 1985 and, a year later in 1986, when she was the first runner-up in the Miss U.S.A. Pageant. After participating in the pageant, Halle became a model. It eventually led to her first weekly TV series, 1989's Living Dolls (1989), where she soon gained a reputation for her on-set tenacity, preferring to \"live\" her roles and remaining in character even when the cameras stopped rolling. It paid off though when she reportedly refused to bathe for several days before starting work on her role as a crack addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991) because the role provided her big screen breakthrough. The following year, she was cast as Eddie Murphy's love interest in Boomerang (1992), one of the few times that Murphy was evenly matched on screen. In 1994, Berry gained a youthful following for her performance as sexy secretary \"Sharon Stone\" in The Flintstones (1994). She next had a highly publicized costarring role with Jessica Lange in the adoption drama Losing Isaiah (1995). Though the movie received mixed reviews, Berry didn't let that slow her down, and continued down her path to super-stardom. In 1998, she received critical success when she starred as a street smart young woman who takes up with a struggling politician in Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998). The following year, she won even greater acclaim for her role as actress Dorothy Dandridge in made-for-cable's Introducing Dorothy Dandridge (1999), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV Movie/Mini-Series.

He moved with his parents, younger brother and sister to London, England. He was raised in London from the age of seven. His father introduced him into Martial Arts from a young age. Ray always wanted to be in the movies, or be like the heroes in movies but he was most inspired by martial arts. He began to nurture a love for martial arts from the age of seven, when his father's love of Bruce Lee films sparked a fire in the youngster's mind that would never extinguish. Specializing in the traditional Chinese Northern Shaolin Kung-fu (in the Chin Woo style) Park moved on to master various other styles, most notably Wushu. In 1991, at age 16, Ray became a member of the Great Britain Wushu team competing in his first international in Beijing, China at the 1st World Wushu Championships. Ray was the first Wushu athletic from Great Britain and Europe to place in the top seven in the world. He went on to compete for Great Britain for another six years. Ray became a fixture at martial arts exhibitions and tournaments, Nationally, European and Internationally attaining Gold Medal for the Great Britain Wushu and Chin Woo Martial Arts team. Ray began teaching himself gymnastics at a young age but felt he was missing the correct training to achieve a higher level. At age 15, he found a school that was willing to allow him to practice and use the floor space. The gymnastic training helped to improve his martial arts training and began to sit in and take seminars in coaching gymnastics. It was when he was 19, he relocated to another gymnastic gym and became one of the boys squad coaches and further went on to be in charge of coaching recreational gymnastics throughout schools in London. Ray's boys squad won 1st in The London Youth Games for Hendon Gymnastics Club. It was during one of his frequent visits to Malaysia that he was approached to audition for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997). Ray became martial arts advisor to one of the stunt coordinator's and later landed playing one of the Reptiles, Baraka and doubling for Rayden. Conjuring memories of his youthful cinematic martial arts passion, Park attempted to learn as much as possible about the process of filmmaking. Soon gaining more scenes and becoming more natural on the set, he was later contacted by stunt coordinator Nick Gillard to audition for George Lucas' prequel Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). Offered the job by producer Rick McCallum, Park was given the creative freedom to develop his choreography by an impressed Lucas, and was soon gaining the confidence to develop his role to the best of his abilities.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjM1NmU1MjUtYTI3MC00YzNkLTgzM2YtMTRjZWM4MjhiOGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjIyMTE5MjA@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0661917","name":"Ray Park","idIMDB":"nm0661917"},"actorId":"nm0661917","character":"Toad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0026704","main":true},{"actorName":"Rebecca Romijn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005381","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjM3MDg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIwNTExMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 November 1972","placeOfBirth":" Berkeley, California, USA","birthName":"Rebecca Alie Romijn","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Rebecca Alie Romijn was born on November 6, 1972 in Berkeley, California. Her father was Dutch-born and worked as a custom-furniture maker. Her mother was American-born, with Dutch and English ancestry, and was a teacher of English. Rebecca attended Berkeley High School where her nickname was the \"Jolly Blond Giant\", then she attended the University of California at Santa Cruz where she majored in Music, but left in 1995. She was a natural for modeling, and has posed for Sports Illustrated, Christian Dior and Victoria's Secret, to name but a few. Rebecca first met John Stamos in 1994, at a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and had her first date with him at Disneyland. They married in September 1998, but have since gotten divorced. Rebecca's favorite foods are fillet mignon, tuna sashimi and Häagen-Dazs Cappuccino Commotion ice cream. But to keep her weight at a svelte 130 pounds, she stays fit with a rigorous stretching and strengthening routine (her firm body tone is evident when compared to photos of her earlier modeling, where she was very slim but not toned). Rebecca's most famous movie role, so far, was as the shapeshifting Mystique in X-Men (2000), based on the long-running comic book series about teenage mutant superheroes (that Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created in 1962). To play Mystique every day, Rebecca had to start out nude, and then two female makeup artists would apply blue body paint and other stick-on parts for 8 hours a day. Rebecca told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) that things like tissue paper would stick to her hips; and, one day, the long hours of wearing sticky paint makeup made her so upset that director Bryan Singer told her to have a glass of white wine and relax. Notwithstanding those technical difficulties, X-Men (2000) was a box-office bonanza, and Rebecca's future in films was assured.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjM3MDg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIwNTExMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005381","name":"Rebecca Romijn","idIMDB":"nm0005381"},"actorId":"nm0005381","character":"Mystique","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001099","main":true},{"actorName":"Bruce Davison","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001117","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmExMzM3ZmMtYjRmYi00YmRlLTliOGMtYTk2ODcxMjkxMTBmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQyNjk5Mzc@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 June 1946","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"With his blond, clean-cut, Ivy League handsomeness and ready-whipped smile reminiscent of Kennedyesque times, actor Bruce Davison fits the prototype of today's more current crop of fresh-faced, likable blonds such as Brian Kerwin and Aaron Eckhart. While it proved difficult at times for the actor to get past those perfect features and find meatier roles, his talent certainly overcame the \"handicap\". Extremely winning and versatile, the award-worthy actor, now enjoying an over four decade career, has included everything from Shakespeare to Seinfeld. He has also served as a writer, producer and director on an infrequent basis. Born on June 28, 1946, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvanis, the son of Clair, an architect and musician, and Marian (Holman) Davison, a secretary, Bruce's parents divorced when he was just three. He developed a burgeoning interest in acting while majoring in art at Penn State and after accompanying a friend to a college theater audition. Making his professional stage debut in 1966 as Jonathan in \"Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Bad\" at the Pennsylvania Festival Theatre, he had made it to Broadway within just a couple of years (1968) in the role of Troilus in \"Tiger at the Gates\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre. The year after that he was seen off-Broadway in \"A Home Away from Home\" and appeared at the Lincoln Center in the cast of \"King Lear\". Success in the movies came immediately for the perennially youthful-looking actor after he and a trio of up-and-coming talents (Barbara Hershey [then known as Barbara Seagull], Richard Thomas and Catherine Burns) starred together in the poignant but disturbing coming-of-age film Last Summer (1969). From this he was awarded a starring role opposite Kim Darby in The Strawberry Statement (1970), an offbeat social commentary about 60s college radicalism, and in the cult horror flick Willard (1971) in which he bonded notoriously with a herd of rats. Moving further into the 70s decade, his film load did not increase significantly as expected and the ones he did appear in were no great shakes. With the exception of his co-starring role alongside Burt Lancaster in the well-made cavalry item Ulzana's Raid (1972) and the powerful low-budget Short Eyes (1977) in which he played a child molester, Bruce was surprisingly ill-used or underused. Insignificant as the elder Patrick Dennis in the inferior Lucille Ball musical film version of Mame (1974), he was just as overlooked in such movies as The Jerusalem File (1972), Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976), Grand Jury (1976) and Brass Target (1978). Bruce wisely looked elsewhere for rewarding work and found it on the stage and on the smaller screen. Earning strong theatrical roles in \"The Skin of Our Teeth,\" \"The Little Foxes\" and \"A Life in the Theatre,\" he won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for his work in \"Streamers\" in 1977. On TV, he scored in mini-movie productions of Mourning Becomes Electra (1978), Deadman's Curve (1978) (portraying Dean Torrence of the surf-era pop duo Jan and Dean) and, most of all, Summer of My German Soldier (1978) co-starring Kristy McNichol as a German prisoner of war in the American South who falls for a lonely Jewish-American girl. In 1972 Bruce married actress Jess Walton who appeared briefly as a college student in The Strawberry Statement (1970) and later became a daytime soap opera fixture. The marriage was quickly annulled the following year. The 1980s was also dominated by strong theater performances. Bruce took over the role of the severely deformed John Merrick as \"The Elephant Man\" on Broadway; portrayed Clarence in \"Richard III\" at the New York Shakespeare Festival; was directed by Henry Fonda in \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial\"; played a moving Tom Wingfield opposite Jessica Tandy's Amanda in \"The Glass Menagerie\"; received a second Los Angeles Drama Critics Award for his work in the AIDS play \"The Normal Heart\"; and finished off the decade gathering up fine reviews in the amusing A.R. Gurney period piece \"The Cocktail Hour\". While hardly lacking for work on film (Summer Heat (1982), Crimes of Passion (1984), Spies Like Us (1985), and The Ladies Club (1986)), few of them made use of his talents and range. It was not until he was cast in the ground-breaking gay drama Longtime Companion (1989) that his film career revitalized. Giving a quiet, finely nuanced, painfully tender performance as the middle-aged lover and caretaker of a life partner ravaged by AIDS, Bruce managed to stand out amid the strong ensemble cast and earn himself an Oscar nomination for \"Best Supporting Actor\". Although he lost out to the flashier antics of Joe Pesci in the mob drama Goodfellas (1990) that year, Bruce was not overlooked -- copping Golden Globe, Independent Spirit, New York Film Critics and National Society of Film Critics awards. Other gay-themed films also welcomed his presence, including The Cure (1995) and It's My Party (1996). The actor eventually served as a spokesperson for a host of AIDS-related organizations, including Hollywood Supports, and, elsewhere, is active with foundations that help children who are abused. Bruce has been all over the screen since his success in Longtime Companion (1989). Predominantly seen as mature, morally responsible dads and politicians, his genial good looks and likability have on occasion belied a weak or corrupt heart. Bruce married actress Lisa Pelikan in 1986 (well over a decade after his first marriage ended) and they have one son, Ethan, born in 1996. The handsome couple became well known around town and worked frequently together on stage (\"The Downside,\" \"Love Letters,\" \"Breaking the Silence,\" \"To Kill a Mockingbird\") and in TV movies (Color of Justice (1997)). Bruce's more popular films these days have included Six Degrees of Separation (1993) starring Will Smith, the family adventure film Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog (1995) and the box-office hit X-Men (2000) and its sequel in the role of Senator Kelly. More controversial art-house showcases include Dahmer (2002), as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's father, and Hate Crime (2005), as a bigoted, murderous pastor. Bruce has attempted TV series leads in later years. With Harry and the Hendersons (1991), he ably directed a number of the show's episodes. He has also been tapped for recurring parts on The Practice (1997) and The L Word (2004), and is fondly remembered for his comedy episodes on Seinfeld (1989) as an attorney who goes for George's (Jason Alexander) throat when George's fiancée dies inexplicably of toxic poisoning. The actor recently completed a TV series revival of Knight Rider (2008). Divorced from Lisa Pelikan, Bruce is married these days to third wife Michele Correy and has a daughter by her, Sophia, born in 2006. They live in the Los Angeles area.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmExMzM3ZmMtYjRmYi00YmRlLTliOGMtYTk2ODcxMjkxMTBmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQyNjk5Mzc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001117","name":"Bruce Davison","idIMDB":"nm0001117"},"actorId":"nm0001117","character":"Senator Kelly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001137","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Sharp","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0789106","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4ODYwODcwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ0MTM5NzE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 November 1968","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","bio":"Matthew was born and raised in Toronto, Canada.
