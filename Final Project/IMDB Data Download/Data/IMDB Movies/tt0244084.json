At a young age, she moved to New York. While there Raven signed with the Ford Modeling Agency. They sent her out on a audition for a movie called Ghost Dad (1990), which also starred the legendary Bill Cosby. She was deemed too young for the role since was only 3 years old, but Cosby could see she had talent. They asked Raven to come back to read lines, and she did so well that she got a starring role as Olivia on the last three seasons of The Cosby Show (1984). After the show finished its run, she decided to try something new like singing. In 1993, she became the youngest person ever to sign with MCA Records. She also went back to acting with a starring role in Hangin' with Mr. Cooper (1992), alongside Mark Curry and a small role in the TV mini-series Queen (1993). After another small role in the feature film The Little Rascals (1994) and the role of Goldilocks in the TV series Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child (1995), \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\" ended. Raven's singing career was doing well and she landed a role in Doctor Dolittle (1998) alongside Eddie Murphy and a made-for-TV movie called Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century (1999). She also starred in Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), but she was not available to do Zenon: The Zequel (2001). However, the Walt Disney Company, which made the Zenon movies, wanted her back to do a pilot for a new Disney TV show called \"Absolutely Psychic,\" in which she would be a supporting character. She impressed them so much that they changed the show's premise to be about her and the show's name was changed to That's So Raven (2003). After the show was a hit she did the made-for-TV movie Les Cheetah Girls (2003) and recorded a new album. A movie based on \"That's So Raven\" may be in the works.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MzM4NTA0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyOTgyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712368","name":"Raven-Symoné","nicknames":["Rae","Rave"],"idIMDB":"nm0712368"},"actorId":"nm0712368","character":"Young Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0393978","main":true},{"actorName":"Jim Henson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001345","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMzI3MjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMDk1OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 September 1936","placeOfBirth":" Greenville, Mississippi, USA","birthName":"James Maury Henson","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Jim Henson never thought that he would make a name of himself in puppetry; it was merely a way of getting himself on television. The vehicle that achieved it was Sam and Friends (1955), a late-night puppet show that was on after the 11:00 news in Washington DC. It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn't need to hide puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets and television would lead to separate projects that had different goals. The first one was his work on the The Jimmy Dean Show (1963) with the character Rowlf the Dog, the oldest clearly identified character that Henson Productions still uses. This show provided an income that allowed Jim to work on a pet project. That project was Time Piece (1965), a surrealistic short about time which was nominated for best live-action short Oscar. Henson shot to prominence when he was approached to use his muppets for the revolutionary educational show Sesame Street (1969). The show was a smash hit and his characters have become staples on public television. Unforetunately, this also led to Henson being typecast as only an entertainer for children. He sought to disprove that by being part of the initial crew of Saturday Night Live (1975), but his style and that of the creative staff simply didn't jibe. It was this circumstance that encouraged him to develop a variety show format that had the kind of sophisticated humor that \"Sesame Street (1969)\" didn't work with. No American broadcaster was interested, but British producer Lew Grade was. This led to The Muppet Show (1976). It initially struggled both in the ratings and in the search for guest stars, but in the second season it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made The Muppet Movie (1979), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie. The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy The Dark Crystal (1982), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work. The most successful TV work in the 1980s was Fraggle Rock (1983), a fantasy series specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible. During this time he also established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects. When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant The Storyteller (1987) series respectively attest to.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMzI3MjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMDk1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001345","name":"Jim Henson","idIMDB":"nm0001345"},"actorId":"nm0001345","character":"Kermit the Frog / Rowlf / Dr. Teeth / Waldorf / Swedish Chef / Link Hogthrob","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000604","main":true},{"actorName":"Frank Oz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000568","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NTM4ODA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMxMjQ0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1944","placeOfBirth":" Hereford, England, UK","birthName":"Frank Richard Oznowicz","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Frank Richard Oznowicz was born in Hereford, England to puppeteers Frances and Isidore Oznowicz. His family moved to Montana in 1951, eventually settling in Oakland, California. As a teenager, he worked as an apprentice puppeteer at Children's Fairyland amusement park. He is one of the primary puppeteers responsible for the development of Jim Henson's Sesame Street (1969) and _\"The Muppet Show\" (1976)_ as well as over 75 other Muppet productions. 'George Lucas' originally contacted Henson to play the part of Yoda in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), but he recommended Oz for the part instead. He developed the character's trademark syntax, returning to voice and puppet the Jedi Master in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). He voiced the CGI character in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005), supporting the transition of the character's rendering to digital. In 2011, the Blu-Ray edition of The Phantom Menace replaced the puppet Yoda with CGI to match the other prequel films. He began a career of behind-the-camera puppet and live action filmmaking by co-directing The Dark Crystal (1982) with Henson. He went on to direct The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), What About Bob? (1991), The Indian in the Cupboard (1995), Bowfinger (1999), The Score (2001), The Stepford Wives (2004) and Death at a Funeral (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NTM4ODA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMxMjQ0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000568","name":"Frank Oz","idIMDB":"nm0000568"},"actorId":"nm0000568","character":"Miss Piggy / Fozzie Bear / Animal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000531","main":true},{"actorName":"Dave Goelz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324397","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMzg3NzQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE5MDAyNzE@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 July 1946","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"David Charles Goelz","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"A longtime puppet designer and performer, Goelz was picked up by Jim Henson and company to design Muppets for various television projects in the early 70's.
