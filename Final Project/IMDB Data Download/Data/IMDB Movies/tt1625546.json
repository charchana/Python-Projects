He began his endeavors in the Entertainment Industry as a studio musician, playing trombone, tuba and keyboards. As such, he played in countless pit orchestras which is where the acting bug first bit. When he made the transition to acting, Mark studied with many of the top acting teachers including Roy London, Ivana Chubbuck, Larry Moss, Howard Fine and Vladimir Ilyin of the Moscow Art Theatre. Mark's film work ranges from blockbuster hits like David Fincher's \"Gone Girl\" and Ang Lee's \"The Hulk\" to notable indies like the \"The Future,\" \"Butterfly Circus\" and \"Stained,\" (for which he received his first Best Actor nomination). Mark's television work includes hit series like \"The Newsroom,\" \"Bones,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Luck,\" \"Dexter,\" \"House, M.D.\" \"Rules of Engagement,\" \"The Closer,\" \"The Mentalist,\" \"Justified,\" \"Big Love,\" \"The Shield,\" \"The Young and the Restless,\" \"24,\" \"Nip/Tuck\" and more.

When he first began shooting professionally, Mark was chosen as one of the \"Best Headshot Photographers in Los Angeles\" by BackStage West magazine. And, in 2010 he was honored by the Photography for Social Change Foundation as one of the \"World's Top 100 Documentary-Style Photographers.\" As a result of his countless hours on both sides of the camera, Mark occasionally speaks and teaches on the subjects of \"Image and Type\" and \"Acting in LA.\" He has co-written several books on the topic of acting including \"The Working Actor's Guide to LA\" and \"The Stunt Guide.\" Mark is the founder of the \"Be A Working Actor Studios\" in Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NjUwODU5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIwNTk3Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0040992","name":"Mark Atteberry","idIMDB":"nm0040992"},"actorId":"nm0040992","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Molly Brink","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1009379","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MzMwMDY0NjleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDg4MzM1Mzkx._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Molly Brink is an actress, known for Hairshirt (1998), 10 Tricks (2006) and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MzMwMDY0NjleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDg4MzM1Mzkx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1009379","name":"Molly Brink","idIMDB":"nm1009379"},"actorId":"nm1009379","character":"The Mistress","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Byron Chung","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161187","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Byron Chung is an actor, known for When Hell Was in Session (1979), The Letter (1982) and Assolto per aver commesso il fatto (1993).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161187","name":"Byron Chung","idIMDB":"nm0161187"},"actorId":"nm0161187","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kelly Cole","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1180140","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MDg5MTI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDI2NDgy._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Kelly Cole is an actress and producer, known for Whodamndunnit?
