The fifth of nine children, he was born William James Murray in Wilmette, Illinois, to Lucille (Collins), a mailroom clerk, and Edward Joseph Murray II, who sold lumber. He is of Irish descent. Among his siblings are actors Brian Doyle-Murray, Joel Murray, and John Murray. He and most of his siblings worked as caddies, which paid his tuition to Loyola Academy, a Jesuit school. He played sports and did some acting while in that school, but in his words, mostly \"screwed off.\" He enrolled at Regis College in Denver to study pre-med but dropped out after being arrested for marijuana possession. He then joined the National Lampoon Radio Hour with fellow members Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, and John Belushi. However, while those three became the original members of Saturday Night Live (1975), he joined Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell (1975), which premiered that same year. After that show failed, he later got the opportunity to join Saturday Night Live (1975), for which he earned his first Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy-Variety or Music Series. He later went on to star in comedy films, including Arrête de ramer, t'es sur le sable (1979), Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Tootsie (1982), Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), Scrooged (1988), What About Bob?

After his footwork years during which he earned Bronze, Silver and Gold medals in dance for the stage, he performed in London, Holland, Ireland and Scotland. He made his American stage debut in 1955 in a production of \"Stalag 17\" with Jason Robards and Jules Munshin. Many plays in summer stock, regional and off-Broadway followed in a variety of theatrical offerings, from revues to Shakespeare (in a particularly low period, he worked as a magician's assistant for $10 a performance). In 1957 Ian was drafted into the army and stationed in Germany. He was in Special Services, where he directed the Continental premiere of \"Separate Tables\" and toured with Olivia de Havilland in her show. Back in the US, Ian went to California for a backers' audition. That fizzled but he began his long and successful film and television career. For the past 40 years, his theatrical work highlights have included; \"As You Like It\", \"Hamlet\", \"Misalliance\", \"The Good Doctor\", \"The Way Of The World\", \"Mary Stuart\", \"Crucifer Of Blood\", \"Journey's End\", \"The Wrong Box\", \"The Cocktail Party\", \"Bert & Maisy\", \"Other Places\", \"Bent\", \"Natural Causes\", \"The Vortex\", \"Rough Crossing\", \"Africa\", \"Road & Lettice\" and \"Lovage\".

He was born on May 5 1944 in Aberystwyth, Wales, and acted in church and Boy Scouts stage productions while growing up in South London, but studied painting and lithography at the Slade School of Art. He had to quit his studies, however, when his father died and he had to help support the family. His first paying jobs in show business were as a scenery painter. He was painting scenery, in fact, when he was asked to sub in for a part and made his acting debut. He put away his brushes for good after this. He turned to acting on a full-time basis in the mid-1960s and appeared on both the London and Scottish stages. After his fourth audition, the Royal Shakespeare Company finally hired him as a walk-on, sword carrier and bit player in 1968. He then worked his way up through the RSC's ranks, finally achieving stardom in the early 1980s in the 8-1/2 hour stage adaptation of \"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickelby\", which had a cast of 40 actors, and for which he won both an Olivier Award and a Tony Award. Rees was also nominated for an Emmy Award for the television version of the play. By this time, he had several TV movies to his name, but he did not make his large-screen debut until Star 80 (1983). Living in the United States since 1989, Roger made a name for himself in America when he joined the cast of the TV hit comedy Cheers (1982) as the priggish Britisher Robin Colcord and later the glib British ambassador Lord John Marbury on the series The West Wing (1999). More recently, he appeared as a frequent guest in several British and American television series and in a number of independent films. However, Roger Rees remained primarily a man of the theatre with secondary careers as a playwright and stage director. Married to theatre collaborator Eric Elice (aka Rick Elice) since 2011, Roger was subsequently diagnosed with cancer. Performing on Broadway in the musical \"The Visit\" starring Chita Rivera, he was forced to quit the show in late May of 2015. The 71-year-old actor died on July 10, 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjIwODkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk0MjgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0715953","name":"Roger Rees","idIMDB":"nm0715953"},"actorId":"nm0715953","character":"Mr. Hobbs","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000615","main":true},{"actorName":"Lucy Davis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0205063","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcwMzI2MzY0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDkzMDE1._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 January 1973","placeOfBirth":" Solihull, West Midlands, England, UK","birthName":"Lucy Clare Davis","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Lucy Davis was born on January 2, 1973 in Solihull, West Midlands, England as Lucy Clare Davis.

It helps, of course, having natural comedic timing and the necessary vocal skills to be in constant demand. She was born Ellen Jane Carr on August 13, 1950, in Loughton, Essex. The daughter of Patrick Carr, a steel erector, and Gwendoline Rose (née Clark), a postal employee, an innate gift for performing was discovered early on by a teacher. As a result, she took acting classes at the Arts Educational School and Corona Stage School, both in London. Jane made her stage debut at age 14 in a production of \"The Spider's Web\", then went on to appear as the impressionable, ill-fated student \"Mary McGregor\" in \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\", starring Vanessa Redgrave at the Wyndham's Theatre in 1966. Earning smashing reviews, Jane recreated her shy, stuttering misfit with a delicate mixture of pathos and poignancy in the film version of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969), this time with Oscar-winning Maggie Smith at the helm as the dangerously influential schoolteacher. A year later, Jane displayed just how extensive her range is projecting devilish menace and merriment in the little known but excellent cult black comedy Something for Everyone (1970), which became a cinematic highlight in the careers of both Michael York and Angela Lansbury, as well. In the early 70s, Jane made fine use of her prim, \"plain Jane\" looks for comic effect on several British TV series and in guest appearances. Loftier moments came with the superb series Upstairs, Downstairs (1971) and a production of Daphne Laureola (1978), that starred esteemed acting couple Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright. Never far from the stage, Jane appeared in \"Spring Awakening\" in 1974 and earned a 1977 Laurence Olivier nomination for her work in \"Once a Catholic\". In 1978, she became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) and added a solid body of classics to her theatrical resumé, including \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (Olivier nomination), \"The Tempest\", \"As You Like It\", \"Much Ado About Nothing\", \"The Merchant of Venice\" (with Alec Guinness) and \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". She also reconnected with her \"Jean Brodie\" co-star Maggie Smith in a production of \"The Way of the World\" in 1985. It was not until 1986 that Jane came to the States playing multiple key roles in the epic RSC revival of \"The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby\" on Broadway. When the touring company returned to England, Jane elected to stay in Los Angeles. The following year, she married Chicago-born actor Mark Arnott. They have a son, Dash Arnott (aka Dashiel James Arnott). Jane proceeded to develop an American fanbase after being cast in the role of warm and fizzy Louise Mercer in the sitcom Dear John (1988), which lasted four seasons. With her chirpy British tones, she also managed to carve a career for herself in animated voicework. While she continues to appear occasionally on TV and in films, she hasn't found quite the showcase she did with Dear John (1988), but has enhanced a number of such off-kiltered shows as Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000) and Monk (2002) with her unique brand of comedy. Recent plays have included \"The Cider House Rules\", \"Noises Off\", \"Blithe Spirit\" (as \"Madame Arcati\"), \"Habeas Corpus\" and David Hare's \"Stuff Happens (as \"First Lady Laura Bush\" opposite Keith Carradine's bemused \"President Bush\"). Jane's latest venture on Broadway has been as \"Mrs. Brill\" in the musical, \"Mary Poppins\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5OTUzNTMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkxNjM0MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139732","name":"Jane Carr","idIMDB":"nm0139732"},"actorId":"nm0139732","character":"Mrs. Whitney","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0163012","main":true},{"actorName":"Oliver Muirhead","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611407","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NTI1MTgwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg0NDEzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 May 1957","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Oliver Muirhead was born on May 29, 1957 in London, England.
