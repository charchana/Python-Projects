His father was a United Nations diplomat assigned to Switzerland and, as a result, Chris was educated at private boarding schools in Geneva. Inspired through his having appeared in a play at age 12, he went to the Paris Conservatoire where he remained for two years. After a few small parts in French films, beginning in 1980, he successfully competed for the title role in Warner Bros. Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984). His co-stars included Ian Holm, James Fox and Ralph Richardson (in his final film performance). The movie was popular with Tarzan buffs for remaining faithful (in the first half at least) to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original story. Two years later Lambert brought to the screen Gregory Widens' legendary Connor MacLeod, the immortal Highlander (1986), born in the Highlands of Scotland in 1518 and carrying over into the futuristic Highlander II: The Quickening (1991) and Highlander: The Final Dimension (1994).

His directorial skills can be seen in the retelling of the epic mini-series \"Roots\" starring Forest Whitaker and Matthew Goode. Van Pebbles has directed award-winning shows such as the recent hit \"Empire\" and \"The Last Ship,\" as well as \"Sons of Anarchy,\" \"Lost,\" \"Damages,\" and \"Boss.\" As an actor Van Peebles has credits are as equally impressive. An independent filmmaker to his core, Van Pebbles grew up watching Melvin Van Peebles, his maverick filmmaker father. A true master craftsman in his own right, Van Peebles is defined as a director, screenwriter, playwright, novelist and composer; known for funding his own work. His many talents can be seen in films like his directorial breakout hit \"New Jack City,\" \"Posse\" and \"Panther;\" plus Michael Mann's Oscar® nominated \"Ali,\" in which he received critical acclaim for his role as real life minister and human rights activist Malcom X; the multi-award-winning \"Cotton Club\" written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Clint Eastwood's \"Heartbreak Ridge;\" and several projects with Ava DuVernay. Throughout his career, Van Peebles has brought challenging, compelling material to the screen, including his hip hop coming-of-age film \"We the Party,\" for which he wrote, directed and produced; his documentary short \"Bring You're a Game;\" and, of course, \"Baadasssss!\" This was Van Peebles' odyssey about the making of his father's groundbreaking film \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" and was one of Ebert and Roeper's ten best movies of the year for 2004. As a director, Van Pebbles has affected unusually strong performances from his fellow actors. They often remark that he creates a collaborative climate where they feel free to do their best work. He believes his background as an actor helps him approach the actor's character development process internally. Conversely, he believes being a director has made him a more trusting, nuanced actor. Being able to do both is like creative crop rotation for Van Peebles. Not many directors get the privilege of being directed by other strong filmmakers. Acting for others is still \"super exciting\" to him. In 1994, Hofstra University awarded Van Peebles an honorary doctorate of humane letters. After earning a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Columbia University, Van Peebles spent two years working at New York's Department of Environmental Protection before moving to Hollywood to try his hand at acting writing and directing. In addition to directing and acting in features, Van Peebles is passionate about supporting education and eco-consciousness through media. With his reality show, Mario's Green House, he teamed up with his five children and his father to chronicle the Van Peebles family's often-humorous attempts to raise their eco-consciousness as they try to go green in Hollywood. Green \"We never got to the full green, more like Olive green,\" jokes Van Peebles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MzgwOTA1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODI5NjM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005522","name":"Mario Van Peebles","nicknames":["stone","Chip"],"idIMDB":"nm0005522"},"actorId":"nm0005522","character":"Kane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0515056","main":true},{"actorName":"Deborah Kara Unger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000679","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1NDM3NTMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE5MDkyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 May 1966","placeOfBirth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","birthName":"Deborah Kara Unger","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Deborah Kara Unger was the first Canadian accepted into the prestigious Australian National Institute of Dramatic Art.

His parents remained in the U.S., working for the Office of War Information, and, at the cessation of the conflict, were granted U.S. residency by Congress. Mako joined his parents in New York and studied architecture. He entered the U.S. Army in the early 1950s and acted in shows for military personnel, discovering a talent and love for the theatre. He abandoned his plans to become an architect and instead enrolled at the famed Pasadena Community Playhouse in California. Following his studies there, he appeared in many stage productions and on television. In 1966, he won an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his first film role, as the coolie Po-Han in The Sand Pebbles (1966).

He is a mixed blood descendant of Ute,Apache,Comanche, Pueblo, Tlascalan, French, Sephardic Jew and Andalusian Moor. After high school, he spent three years serving in the military in Germany. After his discharge, he worked as an alpine ski instructor in Taos, New Mexico. Ski Flash Magazine out of France wrote about him and his unique style of teaching skiing. He left the world of professional skiing after traveling extensively through Mexico, Central and South America on his way to teach in San Carlos de Bariloche in Argentina. It was a wake up call to exploring native America and beginning his journey in creating art based on his cultural roots.. He started work in the theatre as a scenic painter and landed his first job in 1977 as an actor/dancer in a production of \"EQUUS\", in Santa Fe, N.M. It was his first paid professional work as well as his debut in the theatre with no training at all albeit high school drama. He now had the bug to study formally. He began dancing in Los Angeles in 1978 at USC and saw his first modern dance and ballet productions; Pilobolus, Martha Graham and Rudolph Nureyev. He was hooked. The next two years, he trained extensively with the Toronto Dance Theatre and Nikolais/Louis Dance Lab in New York City on scholarships. He was asked to join Nikolais Dance Theatre under the direction of the master Alwin Nikolais, who became his mentor and he began touring the world performing in the grandest of opera houses and old Roman theaters in northern Africa to bamboo fields in China. He also learned scenic, costume and lighting design during this time from 1980 to 1987. After leaving the company, he began his solo work as dancer and choreographer and commenced his journey into shamanic ceremonials and incorporating native myths and legends in his work. After the first decade of performing as a dancer, he became the choreographer and co-director for the American Indian dance Theatre, the first professional native dance company incorporating traditional dance with contemporary retelling of myths and legends. He choreographed, \"The Shaman's Journey\", for the Asia Society in New York City and later was adapted into a short film for PBS on Alive From Off Center. He went on to join creative partners Alejandro Roncerria and Rene Highway in Toronto. This work resulted in creating successful theatre pieces for Native Earth Theatre Company. He directed, \"The Son Of Ayash\" and \"The Jaguar Project\". For Buffalo State College and the Repertory Dance Theatre of Utah, he directed,\"The Maid of the Mist and the Thunder Beings\", and for the Ordway Music Theatre, \"Tribe\". His work with Alejandro continued and he helped establish the Aboriginal Dance Project at the Banff Center for the Arts to further train Indigenous dancers from all over the world. For New Line Cinema, he choreographed the dances, ceremonies and rituals for Terrence Malick's film, \"The New World\". Raoul began work as an actor in film and television in 1988 and continues to work up to the present. See resume for those projects.

It is the umbrella company for Tzacol Tantric Theatre and Tzacol Tribal Theatre made up of dancer, actor and aerial artists, producing original work in the realm of tartaric and tribal spectacle. \"Forbidden Goddesses\", is the first realized work. Work on \"Journey\", a multi-media piece for Roots and Rhythms Festival in Santa Fe resulted in the full evening work, \"Homo Erectus\". These last works are multi-media and inter-disciplinary theatre and film projects. \"The Dreamer\" is his first completed screenplay. In 2002 he received the CANCOM Ross Charles award in Canada to attend the Banff Center's screenwriters workshop for aboriginal storytellers.
