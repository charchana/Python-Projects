At the age of 20, he won a scholarship to the Central School of Speech and Drama, where he befriended future playwright Harold Pinter. After two years training, Barry went on tour with Andrew McMaster and fellow actors Patrick Magee and Kenneth Haigh through the Republic of Ireland. Their repertoire included thirteen plays (mostly Shakespearean, but also including J.B. Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls'). Barry's first role was as Lorenzo in 'The Merchant of Venice'. In 1955, he hit the lights of London with 'The Night of the Ball' at the New Theatre and six years later had his first starring role as Cornelius Christian in 'Fairy Tales of New York'. During the remainder of the decade, Barry played through an immensely varied array of characters, ranging from Adhemar in the French comedy 'Let's Get a Divorce' to King John and Macbeth at the Nottingham Playhouse. He appeared with Dame Wendy Hiller in 'Driving Miss Daisy' and with Lotte Lenya in 'Brecht on Brecht' at The Royal Court. His portfolio also included two Pinter plays, 'The Basement' and 'The Tea Party'. He also, in 1963, acted on Broadway, San Francisco and Los Angeles in a double bill, 'The Private Ear' and 'The Public Eye' by Peter Shaffer. Time Magazine (October 18,1963) described his performance as Cristoforou as \"a remarkable and indefinable creation\" and \"the most antic and mythic embodiment of Life Force since Zorba the Greek danced off the pages of Nikos Kazantzakis novel\". While he had appeared in film roles since the mid-1950's, it was on the small screen where Barry Foster had his greatest success, namely as the trench-coated Dutch detective Van der Valk (1972). Beginning with the catchy theme song 'Eye Level' (a British chart topper in 1973), this 1970's TV series filmed on location in Amsterdam, introduced a rather off-beat type of detective than hitherto seen: introspective, often rash and moody, at times anti-establishmentarian, yet with great compassion, wit and intelligence. Barry Foster himself remarked about the popular Van der Valk: \"He is understanding and does not disapprove. That isn't his job, anyway. He's a lovely guy to play, a thoughtful, unorthodox cop with a touch of the private eye\" (The Independent, 13/2/2002). Other notable television roles followed. Among the best of them was as Kaiser Wilhelm in BBC's excellent miniseries Fall of Eagles (1974). He was again perfectly cast as eccentric spook Saul Enderby, one of Smiley's People (1982), played with typical aplomb and dry humour. In 1978, Barry lent his voice to an impersonation of the great detective Sherlock Holmes in a 13-part BBC radio series. In films, Barry will be best remembered as the serial killing grocer Bob Rusk in Hitchcock's thriller Frenzy (1972). From the 1980's, Barry Foster concentrated once again on the theatre. In 1995, he toured 1995 Australia with Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls' (playing the part of Inspector Goole), directed by Stephen Daldry. In 2000, he starred as Prospero in 'The Tempest' and, just prior to his death, appeared with Nigel Havers and Roger Lloyd Pack in the play 'Art' at the London Whitehall theatre. Barry Foster was a wonderfully adaptable and likeable actor, who once explained his versatility thus: \"I'm neither very tall nor very short. You can't look at my face and say 'he's the killer', or 'the guy next door' or 'the mad scientist'. All I've got is my curly hair - which everyone thinks is a wig anyway\" (The Telegraph, 12/2/2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMjM4NjE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ1NjIwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0287687","name":"Barry Foster","idIMDB":"nm0287687"},"actorId":"nm0287687","character":"Dave Hollis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nigel Green","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338210","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMDEyMDkzNzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIxMTYyMDIx._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 October 1924","placeOfBirth":" Pretoria, South Africa","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"The character actor Nigel Green, born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1924, was educated in England and studied chemical engineering before winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. By age 24, he was appearing on stage at both the Old Vic and Stratford-on-Avon, and in the early 1950s, he made his film and television debuts. In 1956, he received serious injuries in an accident, but he fully recovered and established himself as a familiar figure in British film and television. His forceful, dominant manner inevitably led Green to military and authoritarian roles throughout his career while his tall, muscular physique was appropriate for playing such characters as Fertog \"The Bear\" in the television series William Tell (1958), Little John in Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960), and Hercules in Jason and the Argonauts (1963). Green had a number of small film roles in the early 1960s until his appearance in the critically acclaimed Zulu (1964), after which his film roles improved. Perhaps his best-known performance is that of Michael Caine 's superior in the stylish spy film The Ipcress File (1965). In addition to a few British horror films, such as The Skull (1965), The Face of Fu Manchu (1965), and Countess Dracula (1971), Green also appeared in a number of Hollywood films, including Tobruk (1967), The Wrecking Crew (1968) and The Kremlin Letter (1970). Green's later films brought him international recognition and a chance at stardom; however, his career was brought to an abrupt end by his sudden death in 1972 at age 47 from an accidental overdose of sleeping pills.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMDEyMDkzNzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIxMTYyMDIx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338210","name":"Nigel Green","idIMDB":"nm0338210"},"actorId":"nm0338210","character":"Ralph Monk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tamara Hinchco","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385474","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tamara Hinchco is an actress, known for The Private Right (1966), Solitaire (1961) and Love Story (1959).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385474","name":"Tamara Hinchco","idIMDB":"nm0385474"},"actorId":"nm0385474","character":"Second Waitress","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dinsdale Landen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484553","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMTQxNzI0ODheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYwODAxMzIx._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1932","placeOfBirth":" Margate, Kent, England, UK","birthName":"Dinsdale James Landen","bio":"Dinsdale Landen was educated at King's School, Rochester and spent a time at the Florence Moore Drama School.
