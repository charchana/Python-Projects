Eliane holds a certificate in film writing from the University of Québec in Montréal. She has been in the TV and film industry over the past 12 years. She mostly is a self-taught actor and filmmaker. In May 2014 she applied at the Canadian Film Center Actor's Conservatory, where she was accepted among 9 actors from across Canada. She got awarded a significant grant from The Brian Linehan Foundation for her 6 month residency in the acting program. She's now driven to work in the Canadian and American market. Throughout her acting career, Eliane has mainly played dramatic roles but she recently had a taste of comedy in Chloé Robichaud's successful web series Feminin/Feminin. She is also the interpreter of Emiliana Cyr in Quebec's box office success Louis Cyr: The strongest man in the world. Currently, she has a recurring role in the 3rd season of the TV show Mémoires Vives which will be aired on Radio-Canada in September 2015. Eliane has always had the need and passion for writing. She enrolled in the scriptwriting program of Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) in 2009. In 2013, she wrote and produced a short film entitled Douce Amère (Bittersweet) that has screened at many festivals around the world. The film won Best International Short Film award at the International Film Festival of Williamsburg in New York City. Her challenging experience on Bittersweet production made her realize the importance of having full artistic control of her own work. After 12 years working as an actress and 6 years as a writer, Gagnon finally feels ready to make, from A to Z, her first short film: LOST ONES. Her experience only strengthened her desire to make more films and she is now focused on gaining experience as a director. LOST ONES also gave her the opportunity to start up her own production company, Galop Films, created with her artistic partner actress-writer Valérie Gervais Lillo. Currently, as a writer, she is developing two bilingual feature films: How Could I be loved (English/French) and she is co-writing La Gloria (French/Spanish) with the same production partner.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMTU2NDczNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIyNjk5NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1799768","name":"Eliane Gagnon","nicknames":["Ellie Winn"],"idIMDB":"nm1799768"},"actorId":"nm1799768","character":"Émiliana Cyr","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marilyn Castonguay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4411601","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Marilyn Castonguay is an actress, known for L'affaire Dumont (2012), Miraculum (2014) and L'ange gardien (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4411601","name":"Marilyn Castonguay","idIMDB":"nm4411601"},"actorId":"nm4411601","character":"Marie-Amélina Cyr","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0419492","main":true},{"actorName":"Elias Toufexis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1340118","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMzczMjcwODBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYyOTU1MTAy._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 October 1975","placeOfBirth":" Montréal, Québec, Canada","birthName":"Illya George Toufexis","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Elias Toufexis has become an actor with a fan base and cult following around the world.
