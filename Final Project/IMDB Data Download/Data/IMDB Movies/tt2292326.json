He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (The X-Files (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\". Henriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien: Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra. James Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), then used him again in The Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Mort ou vif (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998). In addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkwOTMyMDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4NTUyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000448","name":"Lance Henriksen","idIMDB":"nm0000448"},"actorId":"nm0000448","character":"Carl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Randy Wayne","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1357477","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNlNzlhZDUtNmRkZC00OGVmLWI0NDEtMWUzOGVjOWQ2YjVmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc0MzE4NQ@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 August 1981","placeOfBirth":" Moore, Oklahoma, USA","birthName":"Randy Wayne Frederick","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Randy Wayne was born on August 7, 1981 in Moore, Oklahoma, USA as Randy Wayne Frederick.

She (along with her 4 siblings) was raised by her parents, who were both into music and entertainment. Being the only child who really wanted to pursue show business, Quincy finally pursued modeling at the age 17 by attending Model Search America and was chosen from hundreds of girls who auditioned. She then started working with dozens of local Chicago photographers and soon enough went on to become a promotional model for Black Magic for Hot Import Nights, Import Revolution and DUB. Her exposure led her to be featured in over 15 websites for car shows. In 2003, at the age of 18, she was cast in \"The Undead Series\" for Pixel-Flick Entertainment, and also landed a featured role for a pilot called \"You're Hired!\" by Telepictures/Warner Bros, which never aired. As a promotional model, this led her to work with a few photographers in California, Indiana, Michigan and different cities in Illinois. Director/Producer Ray Murphy, Jr. saw her on a website and contacted her to become her Talent Manager. This led Quincy to relocate to North Hollywood, California to fulfill acting and work with Ray. Just a few months after moving, Quincy moved back home to Chicago to choose love over her career and reunite with her high school sweetheart, Danny Castro. Soon after going back home to Chicago, she became pregnant with her first child at age 20. She had a second child just 4 months after her first child was born, putting her career on hold to raise a family. In 2008, she was a contestant on the FOX hit show \"The Moment of Truth\" and walked away with $100,000. The show put her name out and it led to different paths. In 2009, she was cast in \"It Takes A Village\" playing a psychologist and was featured in a short film called \"Andy Got Whupped\". She decided to take a break and focus on her family life, although she still continued accepting modeling jobs. In 2011, she became a promotional model for Dymatize Nutrition, and soon after, pursued acting again. In 2012, Quincy decided to pursue acting full time and soon enough began auditioning. She was cast in a short film called \"Shelter\" with the female lead as Aurelia. She auditioned for the Theatre Production of the 1938 film called \"You Can't Take It With You\" landing the role of Essie Carmichael. In 2013, Quincy and her family relocated to Fayetteville, North Carolina, where her husband was stationed in the Army. She started auditioning in Wilmington and landed a featured role as Nurse Beth in \"Under The Dome\".","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3280928","name":"Quincy Villanueva","nicknames":["Q","Q-Dawg"],"idIMDB":"nm3280928"},"actorId":"nm3280928","character":"Bar Patron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2292326","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2292326","business":{"budget":{"money":"$2,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 22 min (82 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"3.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Antioch, Illinois, USA"}],"awards":[],"votes":"250","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0388115","name":"Caretaker Production Company"},{"idCompany":"co0523641","name":"Full Throttle Pictures"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:12:51"}}
