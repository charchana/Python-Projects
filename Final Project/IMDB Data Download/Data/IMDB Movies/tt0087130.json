Chaykin and his wife Clarice. Irving Chaykin, an American citizen, taught accountancy at the City College of New York. The former Clarice Bloomfield, his mother, was born in Winnipeg, raised in Montreal, and educated at the Beth Israel Hospital nursing school in Newark, New Jersey. Because of his parents, Maury held dual Canadian and American citizenship. He was raised in New York City but moved to Toronto after graduating from the State University of New York, Buffalo, where he studied drama. His uncle, George Bloomfield, made his name in Canada as a movie and television writer, director and producer. Maury would later star in two theatrical movies, one TV movie and 14 TV episodes directed by his uncle. Maury made his debut in the 1975 Canadian film Me (1975). In his 35-year-long career, he appeared in over 150 parts in films and TV series shot in Canada and the U.S. He was best known for his eccentric role as Kevin Costner's commanding officer in the Oscar-winning Dances with Wolves (1990), three films of Atom Egoyan, including De beaux lendemains (1997), and his role as Nero Wolfe on cable TV. (His uncle George Bloomfield directed some of the Nero Wolfe episodes.) He won a Genie Award, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscar, as Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a has-been rock star in Whale Music (1994) and two Gemini Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Emmy. Recently, he had a semi-recurring role as a movie producer based on Harvey Weinstein in the cable-TV series Entourage (2004) and a regular role on the Canadian TV series Less Than Kind (2008). Chaykin was suffering from kidney disease in the last years of his life. He died on his 61st birthday, July 27, 2010, at Toronto General Hospital, surrounded by members of his family. He was married to the Canadian actress Susannah Hoffmann, by whom he had a daughter, Rose.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NjA2NDg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMxNzkyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001999","name":"Maury Chaykin","idIMDB":"nm0001999"},"actorId":"nm0001999","character":"Vinny","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kate Lynch","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528367","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgwOTI5NTIxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQxMzIxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Kate Lynch is known for her work on Arrête de ramer, t'es sur le sable (1979), Lie with Me (2005) and Anne of Avonlea (1987).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgwOTI5NTIxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQxMzIxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528367","name":"Kate Lynch","idIMDB":"nm0528367"},"actorId":"nm0528367","character":"Jordan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kevin King","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0454957","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kevin King is an actor, known for General Hospital (1963), Def-Con 4 (1985) and Iron Eagle (1986).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0454957","name":"Kevin King","idIMDB":"nm0454957"},"actorId":"nm0454957","character":"Gideon Hayes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Walsch","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0909510","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"John Walsch is an actor and producer, known for Def-Con 4 (1985) and Siège (1983).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0909510","name":"John Walsch","idIMDB":"nm0909510"},"actorId":"nm0909510","character":"Walker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tim Choate","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158678","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 October 1954","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","bio":"Dallas-born Tim Choate thought of himself as a better theatrical performer than a screen actor. The University of Texas graduate had a good background in stagecraft, having performed on Broadway (including 3oo performances in the Pulitzer prize-winning 'Crimes of the Heart') and the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, where starred in 'The Philanthropist'. He also appeared alongside Stacy Keach in Peter Sellars's 1986 New York production of Robert E. Sherwood's 'Idiot's Delight', as a French communist (according to the New York magazine reviewer, sporting an impenetrable 'nouvelle' accent!). On screen, Tim Choate had a long association with Merchant/Ivory films, making his debut in The Europeans (1979). However, it was in a TV production, where Tim was to have a singularly popular impact. In an interview, he explained, that he felt comfortable in heavy make-up and using diverse accents, citing actors Paul Muni and Robert De Niro as among his role models. He added, that by becoming chameleon-like, it became easier to 'take risks' with his performances. Thus developed his character of Zathras in Babylon 5 (1994), a pivotal recurring role (with full prosthetic make-up) which did much to illuminate the complex story arc of the series between seasons one and three. According to Choate, he 'channelled' the accent of Zathras within minutes of the audition, while waiting in a parking lot. Zathras was also played with a wonderful sense of humour, which endeared this character to audiences worldwide. Sadly, Tim Choate died aged just 49 as a result of a motorcycle accident while on his way to rehearsals for the play 'Macbett' at the Globe Playhouse.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158678","name":"Tim Choate","idIMDB":"nm0158678"},"actorId":"nm0158678","character":"Howe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeff Pustil","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0701146","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jeff Pustil is known for his work on Check It Out (1985), Chicago (2002) and Saw V (2008).
