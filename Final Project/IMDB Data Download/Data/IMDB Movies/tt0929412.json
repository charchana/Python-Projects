His father was a doctor in Toulon and his mother was an English teacher. At the age of 15, he began theater at school with his brother. His interest in acting grew thanks to his love in literature for authors such as Baudelaire and Céline. Later, he studied acting in Insas in Brussels, Belgium. This was when he decided to have a long career in acting. At this point, he began playing in several plays, such as \"L'école des femmes\" by Molière or \"Le Parc\" by Botho Strauss. Soon afterward, Jean-Louis Martinelli, director of the national theater of Strasbourg, hired him. Charles spent several years with him. There, he played numerous plays as well, one of which is \"Roberto Zucco\" by Bernard-Marie Koltès. In what concerns movies, his career began only later in the nineties. It began with small roles, like Desire (1992) or Just Friends (1993). However, the year where his career really took off was in 1996, with his movie Ridicule (1996), in which he plays a nobleman trying to survive in the royal court of Louis XVI. As time passed by, his success grew, and people began to recognize his true talent. In 1998, he was nominated with a César for Best Actor for his performance in L'ennui (1998). A couple of years later, in 2000, his movie Stardom (2000) was presented in the Festival of Cannes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4Nzc0ODU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzYzNDcz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0075650","name":"Charles Berling","idIMDB":"nm0075650"},"actorId":"nm0075650","character":"Boesson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Silvio Orlando","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650024","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5ODkxMjI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU0MDgwNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1957","placeOfBirth":" Naples, Campania, Italy","bio":"Silvio Orlando was born on June 30, 1957 in Naples, Campania, Italy.

Having made films in Poland, Britain, France and the USA, he is considered one of the few truly international filmmakers. Roman Polanski was born in Paris in 1933. His parents returned to Poland from France in 1936, three years before World War II began. On Germany's invasion in 1939, as a family of mostly Jewish heritage, they were all sent to the Krakow ghetto. His parents were then captured and sent to two different concentration camps: his father to Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria, where he survived the war, and his mother to Auschwitz where she was murdered. Roman witnessed his father's capture and then, at only 7, managed to escape the ghetto and survive the war, at first wandering through the Polish countryside and pretending to be a Roman-Catholic kid visiting his relatives. Although this saved his life, he was severely mistreated suffering nearly fatal beating which left him with a fractured skull. Local people usually ignored the cinemas where German films were shown, but Polanski seemed little concerned by the propaganda and often went to the movies. As the war progressed, Poland became increasingly war-torn and he lived his life as a tramp, hiding in barns and forests, eating whatever he could steal or find. Still under 12 years old, he encountered some Nazi soldiers who forced him to hold targets while they shot at them. At the war's end in 1945, he reunited with his father who sent him to a technical school, but young Polanski seemed to have already chosen another career. In the 1950s, he took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda's Une fille a parlé (Une génération) (1955) before studying at the Lodz Film School. His early shorts such as Two Men and a Wardrobe (1958), Le gros et le maigre (1961) and Mammals (1962), showed his taste for black humor and interest in bizarre human relationships. His feature debut, Knife in the Water (1962), was one of the first Polish post-war films not associated with the war theme. It was also the first movie from Poland to get an Oscar nomination for best foreign film. Though already a major Polish filmmaker, Polanski chose to leave the country and headed to France. While down-and-out in Paris, he befriended young scriptwriter, Gérard Brach, who eventually became his long-time collaborator. The next two films, Repulsion (1965) and Cul-De-Sac (1966), made in England and co-written by Brach, won respectively Silver and then Golden Bear awards at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller, Rosemary's Baby (1968). However, after the brutal murder of his wife, Sharon Tate, by the Manson Family in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release - it was Chinatown (1974). It seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the statutory rape of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from the USA to avoid prison. After Tess (1979), which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his works in 1980s and 1990s became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films. It wasn't until The Pianist (2002) that Polanski came back to full form. For that movie, he won nearly all the most important film awards, including the Oscar for Best Director, Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, the BAFTA and Cesar Award. He still likes to act in the films of other directors, sometimes with interesting results, as in A Pure Formality (1994).
