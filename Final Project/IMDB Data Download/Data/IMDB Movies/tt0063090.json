Jesus 'Bat' Velasquez himself, who also wrote several Mexican films (like The Shadow of the Bat and Santo Vs The Cowboys of Terror, and wrote the novel \"Tlayucan\" (that Luis Alcoriza adapted and directed with the same name), was the one who invited him to participate in film and who urged him to quit wrestling.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148385","name":"Gerardo Zepeda","nicknames":["\"El Chiquilin\""],"idIMDB":"nm0148385"},"actorId":"nm0148385","character":"Monstruo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Noelia Noel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633896","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 October 1933","placeOfBirth":" Buenos Aires, Argentina","bio":"Noelia Noel was born on October 31, 1933 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
