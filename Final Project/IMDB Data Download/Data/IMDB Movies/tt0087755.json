The vehicle that achieved it was Sam and Friends (1955), a late-night puppet show that was on after the 11:00 news in Washington DC. It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn't need to hide puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets and television would lead to separate projects that had different goals. The first one was his work on the The Jimmy Dean Show (1963) with the character Rowlf the Dog, the oldest clearly identified character that Henson Productions still uses. This show provided an income that allowed Jim to work on a pet project. That project was Time Piece (1965), a surrealistic short about time which was nominated for best live-action short Oscar. Henson shot to prominence when he was approached to use his muppets for the revolutionary educational show Sesame Street (1969). The show was a smash hit and his characters have become staples on public television. Unforetunately, this also led to Henson being typecast as only an entertainer for children. He sought to disprove that by being part of the initial crew of Saturday Night Live (1975), but his style and that of the creative staff simply didn't jibe. It was this circumstance that encouraged him to develop a variety show format that had the kind of sophisticated humor that \"Sesame Street (1969)\" didn't work with. No American broadcaster was interested, but British producer Lew Grade was. This led to The Muppet Show (1976). It initially struggled both in the ratings and in the search for guest stars, but in the second season it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made The Muppet Movie (1979), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie. The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy The Dark Crystal (1982), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work. The most successful TV work in the 1980s was Fraggle Rock (1983), a fantasy series specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible. During this time he also established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects. When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant The Storyteller (1987) series respectively attest to.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMzI3MjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMDk1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001345","name":"Jim Henson","idIMDB":"nm0001345"},"actorId":"nm0001345","character":"Kermit the Frog / Rowlf / Dr. Teeth / Waldorf / Swedish Chef / Ernie / Granny / Horse & Carriage Rider / Link Hogthrob / The Newsman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000604","main":true},{"actorName":"Frank Oz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000568","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NTM4ODA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMxMjQ0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1944","placeOfBirth":" Hereford, England, UK","birthName":"Frank Richard Oznowicz","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Frank Richard Oznowicz was born in Hereford, England to puppeteers Frances and Isidore Oznowicz. His family moved to Montana in 1951, eventually settling in Oakland, California. As a teenager, he worked as an apprentice puppeteer at Children's Fairyland amusement park. He is one of the primary puppeteers responsible for the development of Jim Henson's Sesame Street (1969) and _\"The Muppet Show\" (1976)_ as well as over 75 other Muppet productions. 'George Lucas' originally contacted Henson to play the part of Yoda in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), but he recommended Oz for the part instead. He developed the character's trademark syntax, returning to voice and puppet the Jedi Master in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). He voiced the CGI character in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005), supporting the transition of the character's rendering to digital. In 2011, the Blu-Ray edition of The Phantom Menace replaced the puppet Yoda with CGI to match the other prequel films. He began a career of behind-the-camera puppet and live action filmmaking by co-directing The Dark Crystal (1982) with Henson. He went on to direct The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), What About Bob?

Shining shoes as a youngster with his father, his interest in acting occurred early on as a child. At age 17 he toured with a children's theatre troupe for three years portraying Old King Cole and Hans Brinker. Intensive study with acting guru Uta Hagen led to his Broadway debut at age 29 in \"Hotel Paradiso\" in 1957, but he earned his first acting award, an Obie, for his performance in the 1961 off-Broadway production of \"The Moon in Yellow River\". He went on to win a second and third Obie for his performances in the plays \"Fragments\" (1967) and \"The Transfiguration of Benno Blimppie\" (1977). Dark, hefty and prematurely balding, he proved to be a natural on the comedy stage and in scores of commercials (notably as Willy the plumber in the Drano ads) throughout the 1960s. Other comedy theater highlights included roles in \"Auntie Mame,\" \"Everybody Loves Opal,\" \"A Shot in the Dark,\" \"Bell, Book and Candle\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\". In the late 60s he formed a strong collaboration with playwright Terrence McNally and appeared in an off-Broadway double-bill of his one-act plays (his one-act was entitled \"Witness\") in 1968, followed by \"Here's Where I Belong\" a failed 1968 Broadway musical variation of the Steinbeck play \"East of Eden\" that closed on opening night. Their most notable alliance occurred the following year with the play \"Next,\" which ran more than 700 performances and earned Coco a Drama Desk award. Sixteen years later, and shortly before Coco's death, the two reunited for the 1985 Manhattan Theatre Club production of \"It's Only a Play\". Coco also earned kudos for his work in Neil Simon comedies, and \"The Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" (1969), which was specifically written for him, earned him a Tony Award nomination as Best Actor. The two later joined forces for a Broadway revival of the musical \"Little Me\" and the hilarious film comedy spoofs Murder by Death (1976) and The Cheap Detective (1978), in addition to his moving support role as Marsha Mason's depressed gay actor/friend in Only When I Laugh (1981), which garnered his sole Oscar nomination. Achieving stardom first on stage, Coco's other films were a mixed bag with more misses (Ensign Pulver (1964), L'homme de la Manche (1972) (as Sancho Panza), The Wild Party (1975), Scavenger Hunt (1979)) than hits (A New Leaf (1971)). On the TV screen, Coco fronted two short-lived 1970s comedy series, Calucci's Department (1973) and The Dumplings (1976), and also appeared in daytime soaps (The Edge of Night (1956) and \"The Guiding Light\"). Throughout his career he played an amusing number of characters on such sitcoms as Maude (1972) and Alice (1976) and also played bathos and pathos to great effect, not only winning an Emmy for his dramatic performance on a St. Elsewhere (1982) episode but appearing opposite Doris Roberts as the brittle Van Daan couple in the TV version of The Diary of Anne Frank (1980). One of his last TV assignments was a recurring role on the sitcom \"Who's The Boss?\" in 1986-1987. In his last years, Coco received attention for his culinary talents and best-selling cookbooks. The James Coco Diet, an educational book which included chapters on menu planning and behavior modification as well as choice recipes), was just one that he promoted on the talk show circuit. It is probably not a coincidence that he often played characters with extreme food issues. Suffering from obesity (5'10\", 250 lbs.) for most his adult life, the talented actor died unexpectedly of a heart attack in New York City in 1987 at the age of 56, and was buried in St. Gertrude's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Colonia, New Jersey.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM3NjcyNTU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE2ODE1NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168394","name":"James Coco","idIMDB":"nm0168394"},"actorId":"nm0168394","character":"Mr. Skeffington","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0414775","main":true},{"actorName":"Dabney Coleman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001056","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MjMxOTQyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQ3Mjg1._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 January 1932","placeOfBirth":" Austin, Texas, USA","birthName":"Dabney Wharton Coleman","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"For decades, Dabney Coleman has often appeared as a smarmy, selfish, nervous person, often with money, who is mostly out for himself. He did such a good job in this type of part that he's made a career of it in film. Dabney Wharton Coleman was born in Austin, Texas, to Mary Wharton (Johns) and Melvin Randolph Coleman. He attended the Virginia Military Institute, and studied law in Texas. Coleman has a well deserved reputation as a fine character actor, and a reliable presence for almost any role in TV and movies. Dabney Coleman's early appearances in the cinema were in The Slender Thread (1965) and Downhill Racer (1969). On TV he starred in That Girl (1966). As the 1970s approached he became a well-known character actor in television and movies, appearing in The Towering Inferno (1974), Midway (1976), and Cinderella Liberty (1973). Television seemed Dabney Coleman's forum in the 1970s as Coleman played the role of Merle Jeeter in Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (1976) and Fernwood Tonight (1977). Coleman made appearances in the popular North Dallas Forty (1979) and the Oscar-winning Melvin and Howard (1980). Dabney Coleman also became known for some satirical movies, starring in the comedy How to Beat the High Co$t of Living (1980) and snatched a lead role for the TV movie Pray TV (1980). Coleman's reputation for playing world-class jerks became cemented in 1980 as the boss to Dolly Parton , Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in 9 to 5 (1980). The next year, Coleman was in very good company working with legends Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn in On Golden Pond (1981). Coleman's hit streak would not end there. In 1982 Coleman landed a key role in the classic Tootsie (1982), further cementing his role as an unlikable wealthy boss in some capacity. In 1983 Coleman starred in the Cold War classic WarGames (1983). During this period he also found many parts in lesser known movies like Young Doctors in Love (1982) and Callie & Son (1981). In 1984 he starred in The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984) and in 1985 he starred with Tom Hanks in The Man with One Red Shoe (1985). In 1987 the actor won an Emmy for Sworn to Silence (1987). In 1990 Coleman took two lead roles, one in the disastrous Where the Heart Is (1990), and the other in the quirky comedy Short Time (1990). In 1993 Coleman starred in the slapstick comedy Amos & Andrew (1993) (a very funny part) and in a remake of the TV show The Beverly Hillbillies (1993) as Milburn Drysdale. Coleman took an extensive line of TV movies, such films as Texan, In the Line of Duty, among others. Coleman took an unusual part in the ABC cartoon, Recess (1997), and then starred in a couple of big money grossers, the Tom Hanks comedy, You've Got Mail (1998), as Chief Quimby in Inspector Gadget (1999), and in Stuart Little (1999), both 1999.

She pounded the New York pavements in the early 1960s searching for work following some stock roles in New Jersey, and gradually made a dent within the New York musical comedy scene with roles in \"Oh, Kay!\" (1960), \"A Family Affair,\" (1962), \"It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman\" (1966) (her standout number was \"You've Got Possibilities\") and \"On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever\" (1966). She also won kudos for her straight acting roles in \"Little Murders\" (1969 Drama Desk award) and \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" (1969 Tony nomination). A one-time member of Paul Sills' Compass Players comedy troupe back in the late 1950s, she served as a replacement in Sills' \"Story Theatre\" Broadway production in 1971. Television beckoned in the 1970s and utilized her singing talents in a small-screen version of Damn Yankees! (1967) starring Phil Silvers and Lee Remick. After a one-season false start as Detective Janice Wentworth on the sitcom Barney Miller (1974), it did not take long for the talented lady to become a household name in another. As the titular waitress/mother in the sitcom Alice (1976), based on the award-winning film Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974) starring Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn, Lavin won deserved stardom. During the nine seasons (1976-1985) the show was on the air, she nabbed two Golden Globe awards and an Emmy nomination. Ever the singer, she even warbled \"There's a New Girl in Town\" over the opening credits of the show to the delight of her fans. Following this success, Linda lavished her attentions once again on the stage. She earned renewed respect, in addition to several critic's awards, for her diversified Broadway work in \"Broadway Bound\" (1987 Tony award), \"Death Defying Acts\" (1995 Obie award), \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" (1998 Tony nomination: as the high-strung Mrs. Van Daan) and \"Tales of the Allergist Wife\" (2000 Tony nomination). More recently, she appeared in Carol Burnett's autobiographical play \"Hollywood Arms\" (2002) portraying Burnett's grandmother. The piece was co-written by Burnett's late daughter, Carrie Hamilton. Linda received excellent reviews the first time around for her stage work in \"Collected Stories\" (2000). She later appeared in a PBS-TV version of Collected Stories (2002) and in 2010 revived it on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination for her efforts. She has also occasionally directed for the stage. Linda was married and divorced twice to actors -- Ron Leibman and Kip Niven -- and in 2005 married her third husband, actor Steve Bakunas, who is also an artist and musician. Since her \"Alice\" heyday, the actress has again found series work, albeit the short-lived Room for Two (1992) and Conrad Bloom (1998). She has also been seen in penetrating guest parts on such established series as \"The Sopranos\", \"Law & Order\" and \"The O.C.\" (recurring).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMTczODg2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk5OTU0MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492089","name":"Linda Lavin","idIMDB":"nm0492089"},"actorId":"nm0492089","character":"Kermit's Doctor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joan Rivers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001672","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NzIxNjc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA5MTQzMg@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 June 1933","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Joan Alexandra Molinsky","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Joan Rivers was born on June 8, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA as Joan Alexandra Molinsky.
