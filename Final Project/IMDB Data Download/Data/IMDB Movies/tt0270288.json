He had one older brother, Bradley, who was killed in World War II. At the age of 16, Clark got his first job in the mailroom of WRUN, a radio station in Utica, New York, which was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. He worked his way up the ranks and was promoted to weatherman before becoming a radio announcer. After graduating from Syracuse University with a degree in business administration, Clark began working at several radio and television stations before landing at WFIL radio in 1952. While working at the station, Clark became a substitute host for Bob Horn's Bandstand, an afternoon program where teenagers danced to popular music, broadcast by WFIL's affiliated television station. In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving, giving Clark the perfect opportunity to step in as the full-time host. After acquiring nationwide distribution the newly reformatted program, now titled \"American Bandstand\", premiered on ABC on August 5, 1957. In addition to the name change, Clark added interviews with artists (starting with Elvis Presley), lip-sync performances, and \"Rate-a-Record,\" allowing teens to judge the songs on the show - and giving birth to the popular phrase, \"It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.\" Clark also established a formal dress code, mandating dresses and skirts for the women and a coat and tie for the men. But perhaps the most impactful change that Clark made to the show was ending \"American Bandstand's\" all-white policy, allowing African American artists to perform on the show. Under Clark's influence, \"Bandstand\" became one of the most successful and longest-running musical programs, featuring artists including Chuck Berry, the Doors, the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and Smokey Robinson. Sonny and Cher, The Jackson 5, Prince, and Aerosmith were among the influential artists and bands that made their television debuts on \"Bandstand\", which is also credited with helping to make America more accepting of rock 'n' roll. With the success of \"American Bandstand\", Clark became more invested in the music publishing and recording businesses, and began managing artists, hosting live sock hops, and arranging concert tours. But in 1960, when the United States Senate began investigating \"payola\", the practice in which music producing companies paid broadcasting companies to favor their products, Clark became caught up in the scandal. The investigation found he had partial copyrights to over 150 songs, many of which were featured on his show. Clark denied he was involved in any way, but admitted to accepting a fur and jewelry from a record company president. In the end, the Senate could not find any illegal actions by Clark, but ABC asked Clark to either sell his shares in these companies or leave the network so there was no conflict of interest. He chose to sell and continue on as host of \"American Bandstand\", which was unaffected by the scandal. In 1964, Clark moved Bandstand from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and became more involved in television production. Under his company Dick Clark Productions, he produced such shows as \"Where the Action Is\", \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes\", and more recently, \"So You Think You Can Dance\", as well as made-for-television movies including \"Elvis\", \"The Birth of the Beatles\", \"Wild Streets\", and \"The Savage Seven\". Clark also hosted television's \"$10,000 Pyramid\", \"TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes\" (with co-host Ed McMahon), \"Scattergories\", and \"The Other Half\". Clark also had several radio programs, including \"The Dick Clark National Music Survey\", \"Countdown America\", and \"Rock, Roll & Remember\". In 1972, he produced and hosted the very first edition of \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\", a musical program where Clark counted down until the New Year ball dropped in Times Square, featuring taped performances from musical artists. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" soon became a cultural tradition, airing on ABC every year with Clark as host (except in 1999 when ABC aired \"ABC 2000: Today\", a news milestone program hosted by Peter Jennings). In December 2004, Clark suffered a minor stroke and was unable to host, so Regis Philbin stepped in as a substitute. The following year, Clark returned as co-host alongside primary host Ryan Seacrest. Many were worried about Clark due to his slurred and breathless speech, and he admitted on-air he was still recovering but that he wouldn't have missed the broadcast for the world. The following year, Seacrest became \"New Year's Rockin' Eve's\" primary host, but Clark always returned for the countdown. Clark has received several notable awards including four Emmy Awards, the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Peabody Award in 1999. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1976, The Radio Hall of Fame in 1990, Broadcasting Magazine Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame. Clark had been in St. John's hospital in Los Angeles after undergoing an outpatient procedure the night of April 17, 2012. Clark suffered a massive heart attack following the procedure. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he died the next morning of April 18, 2012.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NDI4NTYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA5ODAyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163863","name":"Dick Clark","nicknames":["The World's Oldest Teenager"],"idIMDB":"nm0163863"},"actorId":"nm0163863","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sam Rockwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005377","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTM3MzE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg4NDMwNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 November 1968","placeOfBirth":" Daly City, California, USA","birthName":"Sam Rockwell","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Sam Rockwell was born on November 5, 1968, in San Mateo, California, the child of two actors, Pete Rockwell and Penny Hess. The family moved to New York when he was two years old, living first in the Bronx and later in Manhattan. When Sam was five years old, his parents split up, at which point he and his father moved to San Francisco, where he subsequently grew up, while summers and other times were spent with his mother in New York. He made his acting debut when he was ten years old, alongside his mother, and later attended J Eugene McAteer High School in a program called SOTA. While still in high school, he got his first big break when he appeared in the independent film Clownhouse (1989). The plot revolved around three escaped mental patients who dressed up as clowns and terrorized three brothers home alone--Sam played the eldest of the brothers. His next big break was supposed to have come when he was slated to star in a short-lived NBC TV-series called Dream Street (1989), but he was soon fired. After graduating from high school, Sam returned to New York for good and for two years he had private training at the William Esper Acting Studio. During this period he appeared in a variety of roles, such as the ABC Afterschool Specials (1972): Over the Limit (1990) (TV) and HBO's Lifestories: Families in Crisis (1992): Dead Drunk: The Kevin Tunell Story (Season 1 Episode 7: 15 March 1993); the head thug in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990); and a guest-star turn in an Emmy-winning episode of Law & Order (1990), while working a string of regular day jobs and performing in plays. In 1994, a Miller Ice beer commercial finally enabled him to quit his other jobs to concentrate on his acting career, which culminated in him having five movies out by 1996: Basquiat (1996); The Search for One-eye Jimmy (1994); Glory Daze (1995); Mercy (1995); and Box of Moon Light (1996). It was the latter film that would prove to be his real break-out in the industry. In Tom DiCillo's film, he found himself playing an eccentric named the Kid, a man-child living in a half-built mobile home in the middle of nowhere with a penchant for dressing like Davy Crockett, who manages to bring some much-needed chaos into the life of an electrical engineer played by John Turturro. The movie was not a box-office success, but it managed to generate a lot of critical acclaim for itself and Sam. In 1997 he found himself the star of another critically lauded film, Lawn Dogs (1997). Once again he portrayed a societal outcast as Trent, a working-class man living in a trailer, earning a living mowing lawns inside a wealthy, gated Kentucky community. Soon Trent finds himself befriended by 10-year-old Devon (Mischa Barton), and the movie deals with the difficulties in their friendship and the outside world. He also gave strong performances in the quirky independent comedy Safe Men (1998), in which he plays one half of a pretty awful singing duo (the other half being played by Steve Zahn) that gets mistaken for two safe-crackers by Jewish gangsters; and the offbeat hit-man trainee in Jerry and Tom (1998) against Joe Mantegna. After a few smaller appearances in films such as Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998) and the 1999 version of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999), in which he played Francis Flute, he had larger parts in two of the bigger hit movies to emerge in 1999: The Green Mile (1999) and Galaxy Quest (1999), wowing audiences and critics alike with his chameleon-like performances as a crazed killer in the former and a goofy actor in the latter. More recently, he appeared in another string of mainstream films, most notably as Eric Knox in Charlie's Angels (2000) and as Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), while continuing to perform in smaller independent movies. After more than ten years in the business, Sam has earned his success.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTM3MzE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg4NDMwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005377","name":"Sam Rockwell","idIMDB":"nm0005377"},"actorId":"nm0005377","character":"Chuck Barris","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011395","main":true},{"actorName":"Michelle Sweeney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842171","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Michelle Sweeney is known for her work on Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), Braquages (2001) and The Art of War (2000).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842171","name":"Michelle Sweeney","idIMDB":"nm0842171"},"actorId":"nm0842171","character":"J.

Drew Blyth Barrymore was born in Culver City, California, to actors John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore (née Ildiko Jaid Mako). Her father came from a long showbusiness legacy, as the son of actors John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, while her mother was the daughter of Hungarian refugees. Despite a troubled and much-publicized adolescence, and a string of \"bad girl\" parts in lurid crime dramas such as Poison Ivy (1992), Barrymore's star was officially on the rise during the mid-1990s, with notable appearances in Boys on the Side (1995), Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996), and the game-changing horror hit Scream (1996). An eclectic mix of high-profile and low-key film projects followed - such as The Wedding Singer (1998), Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998), Never Been Kissed (1999), Charlie's Angels (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), Riding in Cars with Boys (2001) and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) - proving to once-cynical audiences that Barrymore was not only a capable leading lady, but also a gifted and versatile actor. Next came headlining parts in Duplex (2003), 50 First Dates (2004), Fever Pitch (2005), Music and Lyrics (2007), Lucky You (2007), He's Just Not That Into You (2009), and the much-lauded Grey Gardens (2009), for which she earned Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards for her portrayal of Edith Bouvier Beale. In 2009, Barrymore - whose production company, Flower Films, has spawned several lucrative features - made her long-awaited directional debut with the comedy-drama Whip It (2009), emerging as \"a sensitive director who knows how and when to let an emotional moment linger on the screen\" (TIME). Alongside a recurring guest spot - as the voice of Jillian - on the cult animated series Family Guy (1999), recent acting roles have included Everybody's Fine (2009), Going the Distance (2010), Big Miracle (2012), Blended (2014), and Miss You Already (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTMzODIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM2NTY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000106","name":"Drew Barrymore","nicknames":["D"],"idIMDB":"nm0000106"},"actorId":"nm0000106","character":"Penny","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0215180","main":true},{"actorName":"Chelsea Ceci","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1286870","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1991","placeOfBirth":" Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","height":"4' 11\" (1.5 m)","bio":"Chelsea Ceci was born on November 22, 1991 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Morgan was not always so sassy, but today this is for which she is fondly remembered. She was born Mary Margaret Morgan in 1931 and began performing at an early age for family and friends. She eagerly entertained at school assemblies and, when she graduated from Verdugo Hills High School (California) in 1949, left to seek her fame and fortune on the cabaret circuit. She quickly got a regular singing gig with the Frank De Vol Orchestra and was soon charting her recordings. She first hit big with \"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\" in 1951. Other hits to follow were \"The Longest Walk\" and \"That's All I Want from You\". The now-popular song stylist soon took to TV, making her debut as a regular vocalist on Stop the Music (1949). She was a consistent guest performer on all the best variety showcases, including Perry Como and Ed Sullivan's shows, and in 1956 even managed to hostess her own variety program, The Jaye P. Morgan Show (1956), accompanied by her singing siblings \"The Morgan Brothers (Duke, Bob, Charlie and Dick). She maintained a very proper, wholesome image, as expected, during these vital years. In the 60s, Jaye P. took a long sabbatical from the industry to regroup, with only occasional night club appearances to show for it. But, she came back swinging in the next decade, reinventing herself to a whole new generation. The new package was hipper, fresher, saucier, sexier, funnier and definitely crazier. She focused this time as an actress and comedienne. Wild-and-crazy producer Chuck Barris took a huge liking to this racy new package and made her household name all over again with his cult TV program The Gong Show (1976) and their zany offshoots. Jaye P. let it all hang out this time and Barris' shows were the perfect formats for her to pull out all the stops. Now in her 70s, she has lost little of her zing.

Her parents, Naomi Foner (née Achs) and Stephen Gyllenhaal, are both filmmakers, and her brother is actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Her mother is from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, while her father has Swedish, English, Swiss-German, and German ancestry. Maggie made her film debut in Stephen's film Waterland (1992). She had sporadic roles throughout her teenage years, though she stepped away to receive a degree in literature from Columbia University in 1999. In addition, she studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, which helped with her post-graduation transition back in to acting. Soon after graduation, Gyllenhaal appeared in supporting roles in Cecil B. Demented (2000) and alongside brother Jake Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko (2001). Her breakout role came a bit later, when she took on the daring, sexy title role in Secretary (2002). That part wound up earning her a Golden Globe nomination, and Gyllenhaal followed that up with supporting turns in 40 Days and 40 Nights (2002), Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), Adaptation. (2002), and Mona Lisa Smile (2003), among other movies. Gyllenhaal received her second Golden Globe nomination for playing a recent prison parolee in Sherrybaby (2006). She followed that up with roles in World Trade Center (2006) and Stranger Than Fiction (2006), and then replaced Katie Holmes in the role of Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight (2008). In 2009, Gyllenhaal received great acclaim for her role opposite Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart (2009), which earned the actress her first Oscar nomination. Since then, Gyllenhaal has been seen in Nanny McPhee Returns (2010), Hysteria (2011) and Won't Back Down (2012). Gyllenhaal has two children with husband Peter Sarsgaard, whom she married in 2009.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjY3NzA4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE4MjMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350454","name":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","idIMDB":"nm0350454"},"actorId":"nm0350454","character":"Debbie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0454856","main":true},{"actorName":"David Julian Hirsh","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1014989","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3OTk2MjAxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTA0MjQzNDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 October 1973","placeOfBirth":" Montréal, Québec, Canada","bio":"Born and Raised in Montreal, Hirsh studied at McGill and majored in Criminology at The University of Toronto.
