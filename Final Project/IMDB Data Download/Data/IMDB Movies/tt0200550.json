She later guest-starred on episodes of L'as de la crime (1991), Nowhere Man (1995), Misery Loves Company (1995) and Tandem de choc (1994).

She began to pursue her dream career as a ballerina as soon as it was available to her at the age of 10. Izabella was accepted at the National Ballet School in Warsaw and, though her teachers were concerned about what seemed to be some flexibility limitations of her body from the start, Izabella was determined to realize her dream. She would simply need to train harder and longer than the other dancers, and so she did. She became accomplished so quickly that at the age of 15 she was recruited to go to New York on full scholarship and study at the School of American Ballet. Izabella was on her way to the NYC Ballet and the spotlight of her dreams. However, her body could no longer withstand the rigors of a seven-day a week ballet-training schedule, and in 1997 she suffered from vertebrae, knee and ankle injuries - in a blink, her career as a ballet dancer was over. She found herself 17 years old and wondering what career she would ever find that would fulfill her soul the same way dance did. It didn't take long for destiny to reveal its new and improved plan for Izabella. While back in Warsaw and recovering, a casting director who was working with Izabella's parents asked if she would play a part in a TV movie, \"Lithuania You're My Motherland\". She accepted, not knowing where else to turn. From the first moment in front of the cameras, Izabella was hooked. Her calling to act rang so loudly in her heart that it was unmistakable and made so much sense out of what was up until that moment a confusing disappointment. Once bitten by the acting bug, and never a lady to do anything only half way, shortly before her 18th birthday Izabella was headed back to America, only this time, as an actor. She immediately began training at The Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute and laying the groundwork for a successful career as an actor. Sewn instantly into the hearts of everyone she meets, it didn't take long before the business urged Izabella to become a bi-coastal performer. She came out to Los Angeles just after she turned 18 and a series of fortuitous event resulted in her landing a much sought-after role in Jerry Bruckheimer's Coyote Ugly (2000) playing the heart-breaker \"Cammie\". This role put her on the fast track in Hollywood, and she also got a slew of magazine covers and billboards as well! She followed \"Coyote Ugly\" with a leading role in J.S. Cardone's The Forsaken (2001) and Minimal Knowledge (2002). She has also appeared in The Shore (2005), starring along side Lesley Ann Warren and Ben Gazzara. With a deep passion for dance, movement and the spotlight ever in her soul, Izabella starred alongside hugely accomplished actors Derek Jacobi and Michael Lonsdale in Bye Bye Blackbird (2005). Her portrayal of Alice, a circus trapeze artist in the early 1900s, was the perfect combination of Izabella's most innate talents. She prepared for this role with a rigorous three-month training schedule on both the flying and static trapeze. Utilizing her dance and trapeze skills, along with rapidly learned tightrope walking (which given her skills, wasn't that difficult), she secured a part time role of Raia, a member of the \"Circus of Crime\" circus troop in the 2011 NBC series The Cape (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNTExMjc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM0NjM1Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005232","name":"Izabella Miko","idIMDB":"nm0005232"},"actorId":"nm0005232","character":"Cammie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011468","main":true},{"actorName":"Tyra Banks","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004723","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODU1Nzg5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUxMzkxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 December 1973","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Tyra Lynne Banks","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Tyra Banks was born on December 4, 1973 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Tyra Lynne Banks.

Following a three-year hiatus spent studying at university and re-locating from New Zealand to Los Angeles, Lynskey made a welcome return to the silver screen when she was cast opposite Drew Barrymore in Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998). Parts in Detroit Rock City (1999), But I'm a Cheerleader (1999), Coyote Ugly (2000), Snakeskin (2001), Abandon (2002), Sweet Home Alabama (2002), Shattered Glass (2003) and Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers (2006) came next. In recent years, Lynskey has worked her scene-stealing magic in a variety of projects, such as Sam Mendes's Away We Go (2009), Best Picture Oscar nominee Up in the Air (2009), Steven Soderbergh's The Informant!

Later, she would sing \"The Star Spangled Banner\" to open Dallas Cowboys football games. By age 11, LeAnn recorded her first album on an independent label only available in local stores in Dallas: \"All That\" which featured her signature song \"Blue\". This got the attention of Curb Records. In 1996, 14-year-old LeAnn recorded a major-label album. In 1997, LeAnn released \"You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs\" which debuted on 3 Billboard Magazine charts at the same time: Pop, Country, and Contemporary Christian (that had never been achieved before by a country singer). That year, LeAnn released \"How Do I Live\" which would set a record by staying #1 on Billboard Magazine's \"Hot 100\" chart for 69 weeks. LeAnn starred in the TV-movie Holiday in Your Heart (1997), based on a book which she had co-authored. Capping a great year for the 15-year-old LeAnn, she won an American Music Award, 2 Grammy awards, 3 Academy of Country Music Awards, and 4 Billboard Music Awards. In 1998, LeAnn won a Lone Star Film & Television Special Award for Rising Star Actress. In 1999, LeAnn released a namesake CD, offering her interpretations of 11 Country standards, including \"Crazy\" and \"I Fall to Pieces\" (originally recorded by Patsy Cline in 1960). LeAnn made a cameo in Coyote Ugly (2000) (the low budget movie that raked in big bucks) and she also recorded 4 Diane Warren songs, including \"Can't Fight the Moonlight\", for the movie soundtrack. An amazing career and, since she is only 18, I am sure there will have to be mini-bio updates in the future.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQyNDA1MTc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU3NDI5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005361","name":"LeAnn Rimes","idIMDB":"nm0005361"},"actorId":"nm0005361","character":"Herself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeremy Rowley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746811","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNDY2ODQ5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIyOTAzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Jeremy Rowley is an actor and writer, known for Coyote Ugly (2000), Epic Movie (2007) and Sparks (2013).

The second of five children, he grew up in Rye, New York, the son of Joseph P. Cox, an orchestra leader, pianist, and owner of a successful men's clothing store in Rye, and Alma M. Court a former newspaper and Life magazine reporter and an executive asst. at M.G.M. in New York City. From early childhood on, Bud displayed a remarkable acting ability and appeared in countless school plays and community theatre. Also a talented painter, he earned extra money doing portraits at art fairs and by commission to the people in Rye. However, he knew acting was his real dream and began riding trains into New York City at the age of 14 to begin studying with his first teacher Bill Hickey at the HB Studios in Greenwich Village. Upon graduation from Iona Prep School run by the Christian Brothers of Ireland, Bud applied to the NYU School of the Arts, now known as Tisch. Unfortunately, the acting department was full but after seeing Bud's art portfolio he was admitted as a scenic design major in 1967. Bud continued to study with Bill Hickey and secretly began to work in commercials, - off Broadway Theater, and the soap opera, \"The Doctors.\" He formed a comedy team with actress Jeannie Berlin, and later with Judy Engles, performing Bud's original comedy material all over Manhattan's burgeoning nightclub scene. Bud and Judy won first place during amateur night at the famed Village Gate and were signed to a management contract with the club's owner. Soon after, while appearing at the famed Upstairs at the Downstairs in the musical revue \"Free Fall,\" Bud was spotted by Robert Altman who was in New York looking for actors for his film \"M. A. S. H.\" Bud was hired and from that went on to play the title role in Altman's next film \"Brewster McCloud.\" A quirky May-Dec. love story, \"Harold and Maude,\" next saw Cort opposite Ruth Gordon in arguably his most famous role. After a confused reception, the film went on to become not only one of the most successful cult movies in history, but eventually was crowned an American Film Classic. Bud was also awarded the French equivalent of the Oscar, the Crystal Star, for Best Actor of the Year. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe and a British Academy Award. Resisting type casting, Bud turned down the role of Billy Bibbit in Milos Forman's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest\" and returned to the theater. He made his Broadway debut opposite Donald Pleasance in Simon Gray's \"Wise Child\" at the Helen Hayes Theatre in 1971. Again he resisted being type cast by Hollywood and finally made his first film five years after \"Harold and Maude,\" in the political thriller \"Darkness of the Brain\" or \"Flash\" opposite Marcel Bozzuffi (The Conformist). Title roles in \"Why Shoot the Teacher?\" (one of the most successful films in Canadian history), \"The Secret Diary of Sigmund Freud,\" (a comedy with Klaus Kinski and Carol Kane), and \"She Dances Alone\" (a documentary/fantasy about the real life daughter of Vaslav Nijinski, with Max Von Sydow) followed and led to countless more films. His latest films being the Wes Anderson comedy \"The Life Aquatic\" (with Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett) as well as \"The Number 23\" (with Jim Carrey). Besides his film and theater work, Bud has sung all over the world from Carnegie Hall in New York, to the Alcazar in Paris. He was the youngest actor ever given an homage at the Cinematheque in Paris in an evening hosted by the great comedic actor, Jacques Tati. Bud lived as a house guest for many years with his dear friend Groucho Marx. In 1979 Bud survived a near fatal car crash on the Hollywood Freeway. He continued working in film and theater and co-founded the LA Classic Theatre Works with, among others, Richard Dreyfuss and Rene Auberjonois. Bud performed the entire J. D. Salinger novel \"The Catcher in the Rye\" live in-studio, as well as the one man show, \"An Evening with Truman Capote\" for the radio station KCRW. He appeared with Tom Waits in the L.A. Premiere of Thomas Babe's \"Demon Wine\" and was nominated for the LA Theatre Critics Best Actor award for his performance in Samuel Beckett's \"ENDGAME,\" which he first played in New York at the Cherry Lane Theatre. For his performance as Clov, Bud was awarded the Dramalogue Award as Best Actor. Recent films include Kevin Smith's \"Dogma\", Ed Harris' \"Pollock\", and his own controversial film, \"Ted and Venus\" (Col. Tri Star Home Video) which Bud directed, co-wrote, and starred in with Woody Harrelson and Gena Rowlands and which initially, like \"Harold and Maude\" disturbed some critics and yet was hailed as a \"tiny masterpiece,\" and \"a courageous film, Bud Cort's finest performance.\" Bud is a member of the Director's Unit of the Actor's Studio. Besides Bill Hickey, he has studied extensively with Stella Adler, Joan Darling, David Craig, and Del Close of 2nd City. Bud recently starred in televisions \"Arrested Development,\" \"Funny or Die Presents\", the highly regarded \"Mosley Lane\" episode of \"Criminal Minds and Chris Elliot's \"Eagleheart\" (\"Exit Wound the Gift Shop).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMzM3MDc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4OTQ4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001069","name":"Bud
