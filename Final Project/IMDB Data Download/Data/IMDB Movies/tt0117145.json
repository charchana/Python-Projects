At 14 she switched to ballroom dancing, and four years later to Modern and African dance, studying with Yessica Ivanson and Ismael Ivo. Ingrid Sattes is also a musician. She studied guitar for 8 years, and she was a founding member of the Recrash W avantgarde-pop group from 1991-95, where she played keyboards. In 1994 the group released their CD 'Helluvatime'. Besides that, Ingrid Sattes studied psychology and finished with a doctor's degree. In 1992 she took acting classes in Zurich and Berlin, and two years later co-founded the Off-Off-Bühne Zurich, soon one of the most interesting and most awarded free theater groups in German-tongue theater. The Off-Off-Bühne was open to cinematic concepts, and so it happened that Ingrid Sattes made her first notable appearance on film with her Off-Off-colleagues, playing the leads in 'Nacht der Gaukler' and 'Dr. Younami's Couch'. In the past two years she shifted her focus to appearance in TV films and serials, but continues to work for the stage.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766421","name":"Ingrid Sattes","idIMDB":"nm0766421"},"actorId":"nm0766421","character":"Marlene Merz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hans-Peter Ulli","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0880481","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Hans-Peter Ulli is an actor, known for The Silence Within (1996), Das Deckelbad - Die Geschichte der Katharina Walser (2015) and Champions (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0880481","name":"Hans-Peter Ulli","idIMDB":"nm0880481"},"actorId":"nm0880481","character":"Leon Lubitsch","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Thomas Martin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4089719","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Thomas Martin is an actor, known for The Silence Within (1996).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4089719","name":"Thomas Martin","idIMDB":"nm4089719"},"actorId":"nm4089719","character":"Victor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Péter Palátsik","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004218","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Péter Palátsik is an assistant director and director, known for Push and Pull (2003), Ez nem Sacramento (1995) and Living and Learning (1992).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004218","name":"Péter Palátsik","idIMDB":"nm0004218"},"actorId":"nm0004218","character":"Pillendealer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alexander Seibt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0782315","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjkxNzE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ4MjUxOTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 11¾\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Alexander Seibt was born in Frankfurt/Main, grew up in Zurich, and received his acting lessons in Lucerne and Moscow.
