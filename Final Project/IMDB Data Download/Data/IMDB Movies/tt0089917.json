By 1980 she was performing regularly on stage as an actress at the Black Curtain Dinner Theatre, in the near north side of Indianapolis. By 1982 she had changed her name to Hyapatia (in honor of her Cherokee Indian ancestry). She was a regularly featured exotic dancer (house exotic) at the Red Garter Lounge, where owner John Najem would introduce her: \"Here she is--the lovely and talented Miss Hyapatia Lee\" to much applause from the audience. In early 1983 she went to Hollywood to become a movie star, and wound up becoming one of the most popular stars in the history of adult films. Beginning her film career in 1983, she made about 36 films until her retirement in 1993 (some of her movies were released a bit later). She was married to director Bud Lee for a few years, and they had children together (they divorced in 1993). In 1993 she was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame. She was given the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" from the Free Speech Coalition in 1995. Nowadays, Hyapatia performs as the lead singer in her rock band Double Euphoric. Her porn days are behind her, and she has spoken out actively for environmental issues and animal rights.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0497412","name":"Hyapatia Lee","idIMDB":"nm0497412"},"actorId":"nm0497412","character":"Hostess","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mike Horner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0395121","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 February 1955","placeOfBirth":" Portland, Oregon, USA","birthName":"Michael George Coe","height":"6' 0¾\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Mike Horner was born on February 3, 1955 in Portland, Oregon, USA as Michael George Coe.

Kelly was discovered dancing at the Classic Cat club on Sunset Strip. The delightfully perky, comely, and enchanting Sharon made her film debut in the uproariously raunchy comedy The Dirty Mind of Young Sally (1973). Kelly greatly enlivened such choice lowbrow dross as A Scream in the Streets (1973), The Beauties and the Beast (1974), Sassy Sue (1973), Little Annie Fanny (1971), The Dirty Dolls (1973), The Boob Tube (1975), Alice Goodbody (1974), and Delinquent School Girls (1975). Sharon was severely mistreated by Dyanne Thorne in the first two notoriously nasty \"Ilsa\" features. She had a memorable unbilled bit as one of the titular lovely, yet lethal ladies in the terrific sci-fi/horror camp classic Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973). Kelly achieved her greatest popularity as SuperCherry in Russ Meyer's outrageous Supervixens (1975). Sharon had small parts in two mainstream pictures: She's a woman who's covered with tattoos in Shampoo (1975) and the beautifully naked corpse of Ben Johnson's murdered daughter in Robert Aldrich's gritty police mystery thriller Hustle (1975). In the early 1980s, Kelly began acting in hardcore X-rated porno movies under the pseudonym Colleen Brennan. Sharon Kelly voluntarily quit acting in the late 1980s because of the AIDS scare and went on to create her own home recording studio for phone sex hot lines.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0446869","name":"Colleen Brennan","idIMDB":"nm0446869"},"actorId":"nm0446869","character":"Lady of Bath","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Debra Lynn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528653","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Debra Lynn is an actress and composer.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528653","name":"Debra Lynn","idIMDB":"nm0528653"},"actorId":"nm0528653","character":"Young Abbot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cheri Janvier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155800","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Cheri Janvier is an actress.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155800","name":"Cheri Janvier","idIMDB":"nm0155800"},"actorId":"nm0155800","character":"The Lady","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Buffy Davis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204296","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1966","placeOfBirth":"","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Buxom and shapely strawberry blonde knockout Buffy Davis was born on November 3, 1966.

His career began in the days when porn movies were take-offs of legit films; they had plots, dialogue, relatively hefty budgets and were meant to be seen in theaters. He is still going strong (as of 2011), a holdover (but not a \"relic\") from the \"good old days\" in an era of straight-to-video, low-budget rush jobs with no acting, little if any plot, tattooed / strutting / preening \"actors\" and bored, disinterested or barely conscious \"actresses\". Few porn actors have (or most likely ever will have) a resume as extensive as North's. Few, if any, actors can boast that they have been intimate on screen with as many of the superstars of porn as he has: Trinity Loren, Jill Kelly, Christy Canyon, Keisha, Taylor Wayne, Rebecca Wild, Ashlyn Gere, Victoria Paris, Jewel De'Nyle, and even (on several occasions) the legendary - and, at the time, underage - Traci Lords. North's enduring popularity has spanned generations of porn fans, both male and female, and even after all these years he still continues to impress and amaze both fans and co-workers with his, shall we say, \"range\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyODQ2ODI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIxMjkxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000561","name":"Peter North","nicknames":["The Beer Can","The Decorator","The Senator","Old Faithful","The Sperminator","Sir Cumalot","Al"],"idIMDB":"nm0000561"},"actorId":"nm0000561","character":"Alan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"F.M.
