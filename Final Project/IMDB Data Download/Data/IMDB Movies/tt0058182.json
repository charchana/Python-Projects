They contributed to music, film, literature, art, and fashion, made a continuous impact on popular culture and the lifestyle of several generations. Their songs and images carrying powerful ideas of love, peace, help, and imagination evoked creativity and liberation that outperformed the rusty Soviet propaganda and contributed to breaking walls in the minds of millions, thus making impact on human history. In July of 1957, in Liverpool, 'Paul McCartney (I)' met John Lennon. Both were teenagers. Paul impressed John with his mastery of acoustic guitar, and was invited to join Lennon's group, The Quarrymen. George Harrison joined them in February of 1958. In 1959 they played regular gigs at a club called The Casbah. They were joined by vocalist Stuart Sutcliffe, and by drummer Peter Best, whose mother owned The Casbah club. Early incarnations of the band included The Quarrymen, Johnny & the Moon Dogs, and The Silver Beetles. John Lennon dreamed up the band's final name, The Beatles, a mix of beat with beetle. In 1960 The Beatles toured in Hamburg, Germany. There they were joined by Ringo Starr, who previously played with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. In Hamburg, The Beatles made their first studio work as a backing band for singer Tony Sheridan's recordings for the German Polydor label, however, in the credits the band's name was changed to The Beat Brothers. From February 1961 to August 1963, The Beatles played a regular gig at the Cavern. They were paid five pounds for their first show, rising to three hundred pounds per show in 1963. In two and a half years The Beatles gave 262 shows at the Cavern in Liverpool. Brian Epstein was invited to be the manager of the Beatles in November 1961. His diplomatic way of dealing with the Beatles and with their previous manager resulted in a December 10, 1961, meeting, where it was decided that Epstein would manage the band. A 5-year management contract was signed by four members at then-drummer Pete Best's home on January 24, 1962. Epstein did not put his signature on it, giving the musicians the freedom of choice. At that time McCartney and Harrison were under 21, so the paper wasn't technically legal. None of them realized this and it did not matter to them. What mattered was their genuine trust in Epstein. He changed their early image for the good. Brian Epstein made them wear suits and ties, classic shoes, and newer haircuts. They were advised to update their manners on stage and quit eating and drinking in public. Brian Epstein worked hard on both the Beatles' image and public relations. He improved their image enough to make them accepted by the conservative media. Most if not all of their communication off-stage was managed by Brian Epstein. On January 1, 1962, The Beatles came to London and recorded fifteen songs at the Decca Records. They were not hired, but the material helped them later. During the year 1962, they made several trips to London and auditioned for various labels. In May of 1962 Epstein canceled the group's contract with Tony Sheridan and the German label. Brian Epstein was persistent in trying to sign a record deal for the Beatles, even after being rejected by every major record label in UK, like Columbia, Philips, Oriole, Decca, and Pye. Epstein transferred a demo tape to disc with HMV technician Jim Foy, who liked their song and referred it to Parlophone's George Martin. On June 6, 1962, at the Abbey Road studios, they passed Martin's audition with the exception of Pete Best. George Martin liked them, but recommended the change of a drummer. Being asked by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison; Epstein fired Pete Best. After a mutual decision the band was completed with Ringo Starr, who duly became the fourth Beatle. In September of 1962 The Beatles recorded their first hit Love Me Do, which charted in UK, and reached the top of the US singles chart. London became their new home since 1963. On February 11, 1963, The Beatles recorded the entire album 'Please, Please me' in one day, working non-stop during ten-hour studio session. In May and June, 1963, the band made a tour with Roy Orbison. In August of 1963, their single She Loves You became a super hit. Their October 1963 performance at the London Palladium made them famous in Great Britain and initiated the Beatlemania in the UK. The show at the London Palladium was broadcast live and seen by twelve million viewers. Then, in November 1962, The Beatles gave a charity concert at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. There, performing for the rich and famous, John Lennon made his famous announcement: Would the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands? And the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewelry. In early performances the Beatles included popular songs from the 40s and 50s. They played rock-n-roll and R&B-based pop songs while they gradually worked on developing a style of their own. Their mixture of rock-n-roll, skiffle, blues, country, soul, and a simplified version of 1930s jazz resulted in several multi-genre and cross-style sounding songs. They admitted their interest in the music of Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Little Richard and other entertainers of the 40s, 50s and early 60s. Beatles' distinctive vocals were sometimes reminiscent of the Everly Brothers' tight harmonies. By 1965 their style absorbed ethnic music influences from India and other Oriental cultures, and later expanded into psychedelic experiments and classical-sounding compositions. Their creative search covered a range of styles from jazz and rock to a cosmopolitan cross-cultural and cross-genre compositions. Initially the Beatles were a guitars and drums band. In the course of their career every member became a multi-instrumentalist. George Harrison played the lead guitar and also introduced such exotic instruments as ukulele, Indian sitars, flutes, tabla, darbouka, and tampur drums. John Lennon played a variety of guitars, keyboards, harmonicas and horns. Paul McCartney played bass guitar, acoustic and electric guitars, piano and keyboards, as well as over 40 other musical instruments. The Beatles were the first popular band that used a classical touch of strings and keyboard instruments; their producer George Martin scored Baroque orchestrations in several songs, such as Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, In My Life, and a full orchestra in Sgt. Pepper. John Lennon and Paul McCartney played piano in many of their songs. Their jamming on a piano together led to creation of their best-selling hit I Want to Hold Your Hand in 1963. At first the Beatles were rejected by Dick Clark after testing a recording of their song on his show. Then Brian Epstein approached Ed Sullivan, who discussed them with Walter Cronkite after seeing them on his CBS Evening News in 1963. Brian Epstein also managed to get their music played by influential radio stations in Washington and New York. The US consumer reaction was peaking, a single 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' was released in December 1963 by the Capitol Records. Their sensational tour in the USA began with three TV shows at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, in February of 1964. After that The Beatles endured several years of extremely intensive recording, filming, and touring. They stopped public performances after 1966, but continued their recording contracts. By 1985 The Beatles had sold over one billion records. Music became their ticket to ride around the world. Beatlemania never really ended since its initiation. It still lives as a movable feast in many hearts and minds, as a sweet memory of youth, when all you need is love and a little help from a friend to be happy. The Beatles' first two feature films, A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help (1965), were made in collaboration with an American director, Richard Lester. Their humorous, ironic, and farcical film performances are reminiscent of the Marx Brothers' comedies. Later The Beatles moved into the area of psychedelic innovations with the animated film Yellow Submarine (1966). Their surrealistic TV movie The Magical Mystery Tour (1967) became the cause for the first major criticism of their work in the British press. Their film music was also released as studio albums. Original music by The Beatles as well as re-makes of their songs has been also used, often uncredited, in music scores of feature films and documentaries. Some of The Beatles concert and studio performances were filmed on several occasions and were later edited and released after the band's dissolution. In 1999 the remastered and remixed film The Beatles Yellow Submarine Adventure (2000) delighted a younger audience with incredible animation and songs. All four members were charismatic and individually talented artists, they sparked each other from the beginning. Eventually they made a much better group effort under the thorough management by Brian Epstein. His coaching helped consolidate their talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork. Paul McCartney had the privilege of a better musical education, having studied classical piano and guitar in his childhood. He progressed as a lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, as well as a singer-songwriter. McCartney wrote more songs for the Beatles than other members of the band. His songs Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, Blackbird, When I'm 64, Let It Be are among the Beatles' best hits. Yesterday is considered the most-covered song in history with over three thousand versions of it recorded by various artists. McCartney accepted the agreement that was offered by John Lennon in 1957, about the 50/50 authorship of every song written by either one of them. Most of The Beatles' songs are formally credited to both names, regardless of the fact that many of the songs were written individually. On June 25, 1967, The Beatles made history becoming the first band globally transmitted on TV to an estimated 400 million people worldwide. The Beatles were a segment in the first-ever worldwide satellite hook-up and their new song \"All You Need Is Love\" was broadcast live during the show. Two months later The Beatles lost their creative manager Brian Epstein, whose talent for problem-solving was unmatched. \"That was it, the beginning of the end\", said Lennon. Evolution of each member's creativity and musicianship also led to individual career ambitions. John Lennon was experimenting with psychedelic poetry and art. His creativity was very unique and innovative. Lennon wrote Come Together, Girl, Revolution, Strawberry Fields and many other Beatles' hits. An out-of-context reprinting of Lennon's remarks on the Beatlemania phenomenon caused problems in the media. His comparison of Beatles' popularity to that of Jesus Christ was used to attack them publicly, causing cancellations of their performances and even burning of their records. Lennon had to apologize several times in press and on TV, including at a Chicago press conference. In 1967 John Lennon met Japanese artist Yoko Ono, whom he later married. George Harrison was the lead guitar player and also took sitar lessons from Ravi Shankar. Harrison had his own inner light of creativity and spirituality, he wrote Something, Taxman, I me mine, and other hits. Ringo Starr sang 'Yellow Submarine' and a few other songs. He has made a film career and also toured with his All Stars Band and released several solo albums. His 1973 release \"Ringo\" was the last album to feature all four living Beatles, although not on the same song. The Beatles created over 240 songs, they recorded many singles and albums, made films and TV shows. Thousands of memorable pictures popularized their image. In their evolution from beginners to the leaders of entertainment, they learned from many world cultures, absorbed from various styles, and created their own. Their cross-style compositions covered a range of influences from English folk ballads to Indian raga; absorbing from Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Elvis Presley, Everly Brothers, Little Richard, and others. The songwriting and performing talents of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, fused in the Beatles' music. Lennon and McCartney initiated changes in music publishing industry by breaking the Tin Pan Alley monopoly of songwriting. Their legacy became possible due to highly professional work by Brian Epstein and George Martin. In 1994 three surviving members reunited and produced Lennon's previously unknown song 'Free as a Bird'. It was preserved by Yoko Ono on a tape recording made by Lennon in 1977. The song was re-arranged and re-mixed with the voices of three surviving members. The Beatles Anthology TV documentary was watched by 420 million people in 1995. The Beatles represent the collective consciousness of several generations. Millions of viewers and listeners across the universe became conditioned to the sounds and images of The Beatles. Their influence on the modern world never stopped. Numbers may only show the tip of the iceberg (record sales, shows admissions, top hits, etc.). As image-makers and role models they pushed boundaries in lifestyle and business, affecting customers behavior and consumption beyond the entertainment industry by turning all life into entertainment. A brilliant blend of music and lyrics in their songs made influence on many minds by carrying messages like: give peace a chance and people working it out. A message more powerful than political control, it broke through second and third world censorship and regulations and set many millions free. Steve Jobs, being a big fan of Paul McCartney and The Beatles, referred to them on many occasions and also was interviewed on a showing of a Paul McCartney concert. When asked about his business model, Steve Jobs replied: My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each other's negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. And the total was greater than the sum of the parts. Great things in business are never done by one person, they are done by a team of people. The Beatles made impact on human history, because their influence has been liberating for generations of nowhere men living in misery beyond the Iron Curtain. Something in their songs and images appealed to everybody who wanted to become free as a bird. Their songs carrying powerful ideas of real love, peace, help, and imagination evoked creativity that outperformed the rusty Soviet propaganda and contributed to breaking chains and walls in the minds of millions. The Beatles expressed themselves in beautiful and liberating words of love, happiness, freedom, and revolution, and carried those messages to people across the universe. Their songs and images helped many freedom-loving people to come together for revolutions in Prague and Warsaw, Beijing and Bucharest, Berlin and Moscow. The Beatles has been an inspiration for those who take the long and winding road to freedom. Even after The Beatles had gone, the individual members continued to spread their message; from the concert for Bangladesh by George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1971, to 2003 \"Back in USSR\" concert by Paul McCartney on the Red Square in Moscow, and his 2004 show near the Tsar's Winter Palace in St. Petersburg where the Communist Revolution took place, just imagine. In 2005 the Entertainment magazine poll named The Beatles the most iconic entertainers of the 20th Century. In July of 2006, the guitar on which Paul McCartney played his first chords and impressed John Lennon, was sold at an auction for over $600,000. In July 2012, Paul McCartney rocked the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He delivered a live performance of The Beatles's timeless hit \"Hey Jude\" and engaged the crowd of people from all over the world to join his band in a sing along finale. The show was seen by a live audience of 80000 people at the Olympic Park Stadium in addition to an estimated TV audience of two billion people worldwide.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2ODY1MDA5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU1MzIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1397313","name":"The Beatles","nicknames":["The Fab Four"],"idIMDB":"nm1397313"},"actorId":"nm1397313","character":"The Beatles","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0036976","main":true},{"actorName":"John Lennon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006168","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMDE4MzgzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDQzMzU3._V1_UY44_CR5,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 October 1940","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, Lancashire, England, UK","birthName":"John Winston Lennon","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"John Winston (later Ono) Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, in Liverpool, England, to Julia (Stanley) and Alfred Lennon, a merchant seaman. He was of Irish, and some Welsh and English, ancestry. In the mid-1950s, he formed his first band, The Quarrymen (after Quarry Bank High School, which he attended) who, with the addition of Paul McCartney and George Harrison, later became The Beatles. After some years of performing in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, \"Beatlemania\" erupted in England and Europe in 1963 after the release of their singles \"Love Me Do\" and \"Please Please Me\". The next year the Beatles flew to America to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show (1948) (aka The Ed Sullivan Show), and Beatlemania spread worldwide. Queen Elizabeth II granted all four Beatles M.B.E. medals in 1965, for import revenues from their record sales; John returned his four years later, as part of an antiwar statement. John and the Beatles continued to tour and perform live until 1966, when protests over his calling the Beatles phenomenon \"more popular than Jesus\" and the frustrations of touring made the band decide to quit the road. They devoted themselves to studio work, recording and releasing albums such as \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", \"Magical Mystery Tour\" and the \"White Album\". Instead of appearing live, the band began making their own \"pop clips\" (an early term for music videos), which were featured on television programs of the time. In the late 1960s John began performing and making albums with his second wife Yoko Ono, as the Beatles began to break up. Their first two albums, \"Two Virgins\" and \"Life With The Lions\", were experimental and flops by Beatles standards, while their \"Wedding Album\" was almost a vanity work, but their live album \"Live Peace In Toronto\" became a Top Ten hit, at the end of the 1960s. In the early 1970s John and Yoko continued to record together, making television appearances and performing at charity concerts. After the release of John's biggest hit, \"Imagine\", they moved to the US, where John was nearly deported because of his political views (a late-'60s conviction for possession of hashish in the U.K. was the excuse given by the government), but after a four-year legal battle he won the right to stay. In the midst of this, John and Yoko separated for over a year; John lived in Los Angeles with personal assistant May Pang, while Yoko dated guitarist David Spinozza. When John made a guest appearance at Elton John's Thanksgiving 1974 concert, Yoko was in the audience, and surprised John backstage. They reconciled in early 1975, and Yoko soon became pregnant. After the birth of their son Sean Lennon, John settled into the roles of \"househusband\" and full-time daddy, while Yoko became his business manager; both appeared happy in their new life together. After a five-year break from music and the public eye, they made a comeback with their album \"Double Fantasy\", but within weeks of their re-emergence, Lennon was murdered on the evening of December 8, 1980 by Mark David Chapman, a one-time Beatles fan angry and jealous over John's ongoing career, who fatally shot Lennon four times in the back outside his apartment building, The Dakota, as Lennon was returning from a recording session. Within minutes after being shot, John Lennon was dead at age 40. His violent death was a sudden and tragic end to the life of a talented singer and musician who wanted to make a difference in the world.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMDE4MzgzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDQzMzU3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006168","name":"John Lennon","idIMDB":"nm0006168"},"actorId":"nm0006168","character":"John","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0040280","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul McCartney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005200","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MjE1NzM0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5NzIxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 June 1942","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, Merseyside, England, UK","birthName":"James Paul McCartney","height":"5' 11\" (1.81 m)","bio":"Sir Paul McCartney is a key figure in contemporary culture as a singer, composer, poet, writer, artist, humanitarian, entrepreneur, and holder of more than 3 thousand copyrights. He is in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for most records sold, most #1s (shared), most covered song, \"Yesterday,\" largest paid audience for a solo concert (350,000+ people, in 1989, in Brazil). He is considered one of the most successful entertainers of all time. He was born James Paul McCartney on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool General Hospital, where his mother, Mary Patricia (Mohin), was a medical nurse and midwife. His father, James \"Jim\" McCartney, was a cotton salesman and a pianist leading the Jim Mac's Jazz Band in Liverpool. He has Irish and English ancestry. Young McCartney was raised non-denominational. He studied music and art, and had a happy childhood with one younger brother, Michael. At age 11, he was one of only four students who passed the 11+ exam, known as \"the scholarship\" in Liverpool, and gained a place at Liverpool Institute for Boys. There he studied from 1953 to 1960, earning A level in English and Art. At the age of 14, Paul McCartney was traumatized by his mother's sudden death from breast cancer. Shortly afterward, he wrote his first song. In July 1957 he met John Lennon during their performances at a local church fête (festival). McCartney impressed Lennon with his mastery of guitar and singing in a variety of styles. He soon joined Lennon's band, The Quarrymen, and eventually became founding member of The Beatles, with the addition of George Harrison and Pete Best. After a few gigs in Hamburg, Germany, the band returned to Liverpool and played regular gigs at the Cavern during 1961. In November 1961, they invited Brian Epstein to be their manager, making a written agreement in January 1962. At that time McCartney and Harrison were under 21, so the paper wasn't technically legal, albeit it did not matter to them. What mattered was their genuine trust in Epstein. He improved their image, secured them a record deal with EMI, and replaced drummer Best with Ringo Starr. With a little help from Brian Epstein and George Martin, The Beatles consolidated their talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork, launching the most successful career in the history of entertainment. The Beatles contributed to music, film, literature, art, and fashion, made a continuous impact on entertainment, popular culture and the lifestyle of several generations. Music became their ticket to ride around the world.

In addition to singing and songwriting, Paul McCartney played bass guitar, acoustic and electric guitars, piano and keyboards, as well as over 40 other musical instruments. McCartney wrote more popular hits for the Beatles than other members of the band. His songs Yesterday, Let It Be, Hey Jude, Blackbird, All My Loving, Eleanor Rigby, Birthday, I Saw Her Standing There, I Will, Get Back, Carry That Weight, P.S. I Love You, Things We Said Today, \"Hello, Goodbye,\" Two of Us, Why Don't We Do It in the Road?, Helter Skelter, Honey Pie, When I'm 64, Lady Madonna, She's a Woman, Maxwell's Silver Hammer, \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\" Mother Nature's Son, Long And Winding Road, Rocky Raccoon, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Fool on the Hill, You Never Give Me Your Money, Your Mother Should Know, The End, Yellow Submarine, and many others are among the Beatles' best hits. Yesterday is considered the most covered song in history with over three thousand versions of it recorded by various artists across the universe. Since he was a teenager, McCartney honored the agreement that was offered by John Lennon in 1957, about the 50/50 authorship of every song written by either one of them. However, both were teenagers, and technically, being under 21, their oral agreement had no legal power. Still, almost 200 songs by The Beatles are formally credited to both names, regardless of the fact that most of the songs were written individually. The songwriting partnership of John Lennon and Paul McCartney was really working until the mid-60s, when they collaborated in many of their early songs. Their jamming on a piano together led to creation of their first best-selling hit 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' in 1963. In total, The Beatles created over 240 songs, they recorded many singles and albums, made several films and TV shows. Thousands of memorable pictures popularized their image. In their evolution from beginners to the leaders of entertainment, they learned from many world cultures, absorbed from various styles, and created their own. McCartney's own range of interests spanned from classical music and English folk ballads to Indian raga and other Oriental cultures, and later expanded into psychedelic experiments and classical-sounding compositions. His creative search has been covering a range of styles from jazz and rock to symphonies and choral music, and to cosmopolitan cross-cultural and cross-genre compositions. Epstein's 1967 death hurt all four members of The Beatles, as they lost their creative manager. Evolution of each member's creativity and musicianship also led to individual career ambitions, however, their legacy as The Beatles remained the main driving force in their individual careers ever since. McCartney and The Beatles made impact on human history, because their influence has been liberating for generations of nowhere men living in misery beyond the Iron Curtain. Something in their songs and images appealed to everybody who wanted to become free as a bird. Their songs carrying powerful ideas of real love, peace, help, imagination and freedom evoked creativity and contributed to breaking chains and walls in the minds of millions. The Beatles expressed themselves in beautiful and liberating words of love, happiness, freedom, and revolution, and carried those messages to people across the universe. Their songs and images helped many freedom-loving people to come together for revolutions in Prague and Warsaw, Beijing and Bucharest, Berlin and Moscow. The Beatles has been an inspiration for those who take the long and winding road to freedom. McCartney was 28 when he started his solo career, and formed his new band, Wings. His first solo album, \"McCartney,\" was a #1 hit and spawned the evergreen ballad \"Maybe I'm Amazed\", yet critical reaction was mixed. He continued to release music with Wings, that eventually became one of the most commercially successful groups of the 70s. \"Band on the Run\" won two Grammy Awards and remained the Wings' most lauded work. The 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\" stayed at #1 in the UK for nine weeks, and was highest selling single in the UK for seven years. In 1978 McCartney's theme \"Rockestra\" won him another Grammy Award. In 1979, together with Elvis Costello, he organized Concerts for the People of Kampuchea. In 1979, McCartney released his solo album \"Wonderful Christmastime\" which remained popular ever since. In 1980 McCartney was arrested in Tokyo, Japan, for marijuana possession, and after a ten-day stint in jail, he was released to a media firestorm. He retreated into seclusion after the arrest, and was comforted by his wife Linda. Yet he had another traumatic experience when his ex-band-mate, John Lennon, was shot dead by a crazed fan near his home in New York City on December 8, 1980. McCartney did not play any live concerts for some time because he was nervous that he would be \"the next\" to be murdered. After almost a year of absence from the music scene, McCartney returned in 1982 with the album \"Tug of War,\" which was well received by public and enjoyed great critical acclaim. He continued a successful career as a solo artist, collaborated with wife Linda McCartney, and writers such as Elvis Costello. During the 80s, McCartney released such hits as 'No More Lonely Nights' and his first compilation, \"All the Best.\" In 1989, he started his first concert tour since the John Lennon's murder. In 1994, the three surviving members of The Beatles, McCartney, Harrison, and Starr, reunited and produced Lennon's previously unknown song \"Free as a Bird.\" It was preserved by Yoko Ono on a tape recording made by Lennon in 1977. The song was re-arranged and re-mixed by George Martin at the Abbey Road Studios with the voices of three surviving members. The Beatles Anthology TV documentary series was watched by 420 million people in 1995. During the 1990s McCartney concentrated on composing classical works for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society, such as \"The Liverpool Oratorio\" involving a choir and symphony, and \"A Leaf\" solo-piano project, both released in 1995. That same year he was working on a new pop album, \"Flaming Pie,\" when his wife Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer, and caring for his wife during her illness meant only sporadic public appearances during that time. The album was released in 1997 to both critical and commercial success, debuting at #2 on both the UK and US pop charts. That same year he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II as Sir Paul McCartney for his services to music. In April 1998, Linda McCartney, his beloved wife of almost 30 years, mother of their four children, and his steady partner in music, died of breast cancer. McCartney suffered from a severe depression and undergone medical treatment. He spent much of the next year away from the public eye, emerging only to campaign on behalf of his late wife for animal rights and vegetarian causes. He eventually returned to the studio, releasing an album of rock n'roll covers in 1999. \"Run Devil Run\" made both Entertainment Weekly and USA Today's year-end top ten lists. McCartney also slowly returned to the public spotlight with the release of his another classical album, \"Working Classical\" in November 1999, in recording by the London Symphony Orchestra. His 2000 release \"A Garland for Linda\" was a choral tribute album, which raised funds to aid cancer survivors. In 2000 he was invited by Heather Mills, a disabled ex-model, to her 32nd birthday. McCartney wrote songs dedicated to her, he and Mills developed a romantic relationship and became engaged in 2001. However, the year brought him a cascade of traumatic experiences. On September 11, 2001, Paul McCartney was sitting on a plane in New York when the World Trade Center tragedy occurred in front of his eyes, and he was able to witness the events from his seat. Yet there was another sadness, as his former band-mate George Harrison died of cancer in November, 2001. Recouperating from the stressful year, McCartney received the 2002 Academy Award-nomination for the title song to the movie Vanilla Sky (2001), and also went on his first concert tour in several years. In June, 2002, Sir Paul McCartney and Heather Mills married in a castle in Monaghan, Ireland. Their daughter, Beatrice Milly McCartney, was born in October 2003. Four years later, the high profile marriage ended in divorce, after a widely publicized litigation. \"Whenever you're going through difficult times, I'm at the moment, it's really cool to be able to escape into music\" says Paul McCartney. In 2003 Paul McCartney rocked the Red Square in Moscow with his show \"Back in USSR\" which was attended by his former opponents from the former Soviet KGB, including the Russian president Vladimir Putin himself, who invited McCartney to be the guest of honor in the Kremlin. In 2004 Paul McCartney received a birthday present from the Russian president. In June 2004, he and Heather Mills-McCartney stayed as special guests at suburban Royal Palaces of Russian Tsars in St. Petersburg, Russia. There he staged a spectacular show near the Tsar's Winter Palace in St. Petersburg where the Communist Revolution took place, just imagine. In 2005 the Entertainment magazine poll named The Beatles the most iconic entertainers of the 20th Century. In 2006, the guitar on which Paul McCartney played his first chords and impressed John Lennon, was sold at an auction for over $600,000. On June 18, 2006, Paul McCartney celebrated his 64th birthday, as in his song \"when I'm Sixty-Four.\" McCartney's celebrity status, made it a cultural milestone for a generation of those born in the baby-boom era who grew up with the music of The Beatles during the 1960s. The prophetic message in the song has been intertwined with McCartney's personal life and his career. In 2007 McCartney left his longtime label, EMI, and signed with Los Angeles based Hear Music. He learned to play mandolin to create a refreshing feeling for his latest album \"Memory Almost Full,\" then appeared in Apple Computer's commercial for iPod+iTunes to promote the album. In June 2007 McCartney appeared together with Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Olivia Harrison and Guy Laliberté in a live broadcast from the \"Revolution\" Lounge at the Mirage Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. His 3-DVD set \"The McCartney Years\" with over 40 music videos and hours of Historic Live Performances was released in November 2007. His classical album \"Ecco Cor Meum\" (aka.. Behold My Heart), recorded with the Academy of St. Martin of the Fields and the boys of King's college Choir, was voted Classical Album of the Year in 2007. That same year, Paul McCartney began dating Nancy Shevell. The couple married in 2011, in London. Sir Paul's \"On the Run Tour\" once again took him flying across world from July through December 2011 giving sold out concerts in the USA, Canada, UK, United Arab Emirates, Italy, France, Germany, Sweden, Finland and Russia. In July 2012, Paul McCartney rocked the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He delivered a live performance of The Beatles's timeless hit \"Hey Jude\" and engaged the crowd of people from all over the world to join his band in a sing along finale. The show was seen by a live audience of close to 80000 people at the Olympic Park Stadium in addition to an estimated TV audience of two billion people worldwide. On the long and winding road of his life and career, Sir Paul McCartney has been a highly respected entertainer and internationally regarded public figure.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MjE1NzM0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5NzIxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005200","name":"Paul McCartney","nicknames":["Macca"],"idIMDB":"nm0005200"},"actorId":"nm0005200","character":"Paul","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028940","main":true},{"actorName":"George Harrison","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365600","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjE0NzAzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjQzMzU3._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 February 1943","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, Merseyside, England, UK","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"A master musician, a film producer and actor, best known as the lead guitarist and occasionally lead vocalist of The Beatles, George Harrison was born February 25, 1943, in Liverpool, Merseyside, England. He was also the youngest of four children, born to Harold Harrison and Louise Harrison. Like his future band mates, Harrison was not born into wealth. Louise was largely a stay-at-home mom while her husband Harold drove a school bus for the Liverpool Institute, an acclaimed grammar school that George attended and where he first met a young classmate, Paul McCartney. By his own admission, Harrison was not much of a student and what little interest he did have for his studies washed away with his discovery of the electric guitar and American rock-'n'-roll. There were a lot of harmonies in the Harrison household. He had a knack of sorts for it by age 12 or 13, while riding a bike around his neighborhood and hearing Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\", playing from a nearby house. By the age of 14 George--who was a fan of such legends as , Harrison, who grew up in the likes of listening to such rock legends Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Buddy Holly--had purchased his first guitar and taught himself a few chords. McCartney', who had recently joined up with another Liverpool teenager, John Lennon, in a skiffle group known as The Quarrymen, invited Harrison to see the band perform. Harrison and Lennon had a few things in common, such as the fact that they both attended Dovedale Primary School but didn't know each other. Their paths finally crossed in early 1958. McCartney had been egging the 17-year-old Lennon to allow the 14-year-old Harrison to join the band, but Lennon was reluctant; as legend has it, after seeing McCartney and Lennon perform, George was granted an audition on the upper deck of a bus, where he wowed Lennon with his rendition of popular American rock riffs. The 17-year-old Harrison's music career was in full swing by 1960. Lennon had renamed the band The Beatles and the young group began cutting its rock teeth in the small clubs and bars around Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany. Within two years, the group had a new drummer, Ringo Starr, and a manager, Brian Epstein, a young record store owner who eventually landed the group a record contract with EMI's Parlophone label. Before the end of 1962, Harrison and The Beatles recorded a song, \"Love Me Do\", that landed in the UK Top 20 charts. Early that following year, another hit, \"Please Please Me,\" was released, followed by an album by the same name. \"Beatlemania\" was in full swing across England, and by early 1964, with the release of their album in the US and an American tour, it had swept across the States as well. Largely referred to as the \"Quiet Beatle\" Harrison took a back seat to McCartney, Lennon and, to a certain extent, Starr. Still, he could be quick-witted, even edgy. During the middle of one American tour, the group members were asked how they slept at night with long hair. From the get-go, Lennon-McCartney were primary lead vocalists. While the two spent most of the time writing their own songs, Harrison had shown an early interest in creating his own work. In the summer of 1963 he spearheaded his first song, \"Don't Bother Me,\" which made its way on to the group's second album. From there on out, Harrison's songs were a staple of all Beatle records. In fact, some of the group's more memorable songs--e.g., \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Something,\" which was the only Beatle song ever recorded by Frank Sinatra--were penned by Harrison. However, his influence on the group and pop music in general extended beyond just singles. In 1965, while on the set of The Beatles' second film, Help! (1965), Harrison took an interest in some of the Eastern instruments and their musical arrangements that were being used in the film. He soon developed a deep interest in Indian music. He taught himself the sitar, introducing the instrument to many western ears on Lennon's song, \"Norwegian Wood\"\" He soon cultivated a close relationship with renowned sitar player Ravi Shankar. Other groups, including The Rolling Stones, began incorporating the sitar into some of their work. It could be argued that Harrison's experimentation with different kinds of instrumentation helped pave the way for such ground-breaking Beatle albums as \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Harrison's interest in Indian music soon extended into a yearning to learn more about eastern spiritual practices. In 1968 he led The Beatles on a journey to northern India to study transcendental meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Having grown spiritually and musically since the group first started, Harrison, who wanted to include more of his material on Beatle records, was clearly uneasy with the McCartney-Lennon dominance of the group. During the \"Let It Be\" recording sessions in 1969, Harrison walked out, staying away for several weeks before he was coaxed to come back with the promise that the band would use more of his songs on its records. However, tensions in the group were clearly high. Lennon and McCartney had ceased writing together years before, and they, too, were feeling the need to go in a different direction. In January of 1970 the group recorded Harrison's \"I Me Mine.\" It was the last song the four would ever record together. Three months later, McCartney announced he was leaving the band and The Beatles were officially over. After the breakup of The Beatles, Harrison pursued a solo career. He immediately assembled a studio band consisting of ex-Beatle Starr, guitar legend Eric Clapton, keyboardist Billy Preston and others to record all the songs that had never made it on to The Beatles catalog. The result was a three-disc album, \"All Things Must Pass\". While one of its signature songs, \"My Sweet Lord,\" was later deemed too similar in style to The Chiffons' 1963 hit \"He's So Fine,\" forcing the guitarist to cough up nearly $600,000, the album as a whole remains Harrison's most acclaimed record. Not long after the album's release, Harrison combined his charitable work and his continued passion for the east when he put together a series of ground-breaking benefit concerts at New York City's Madison Square Garden to raise money for refugees in Bangladesh. Known as the \"Concert for Bangladesh\", the shows, which featured Bob Dylan, Leon Russell, and Ravi Shankar, would go on to raise some $15 million for UNICEF, produced a Grammy-winning album, a successful documentary film (The Concert for Bangladesh (1972)) and laid the groundwork for future benefit shows like \"Live Aid\" and \"Farm Aid\". Not everything about post-Beatle life went smoothly for Harrison, though. In 1974, his marriage to Pattie Boyd, whom he'd married eight years before, ended when she left him for Eric Clapton. His studio work struggled, too, from 1973-77, starting with, \"Living in the Material World\", \"Extra Texture,\" and \"33 1/3,\" all of which failed to meet sales expectations. Following the release of that last album, Harrison took a short break from music, winding down his own label, Dark Horse Records--which he had started in 1974, and which had released albums by a number of other bands--and started his own film production company, Handmade Films. The company produced the successful Monty Python film Life of Brian (1979) and would go on to make 26 other films before Harrison sold his interest in the company in 1994. In 1979, he returned to the studio to release his self-titled album. It was followed two years later by, \"Somewhere in England,\" which was still being worked on at the time of John Lennon's assassination in December of 1980. The record eventually included the Lennon tribute track, \"All Those Years Ago,\" a song that reunited ex-Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, along with ex-Wings members Denny Laine and Linda McCartney. While the song was a hit, the album, its predecessor and its successor, \"Gone Troppo,\" weren't. For Harrison the lack of commercial appeal and the constant battles with music executives proved draining and prompted another studio hiatus. A comeback of sorts came in November 1987, however, with the release of the album \"Cloud Nine,\" produced by Jeff Lynne (of Electric Light Orchestra). The album turned out several top-charting hits, including \"Got My Mind Set On You\"-- remake of the 1962 song by Rudy Clark--and \"When We Was Fab,\" a song that reflected on the life of Beatlemania, with Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, who was dressed up as a walrus, but was a camera shy, in February 1988. Later that year Harrison formed The Traveling Wilburys. The group consisted of Harrison, Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and Bob Dylan, and spawned two successful albums. Buoyed by the group's commercial success, Harrison took to the road with his new bandmates in 1992, embarking on his first international tour in 18 years. Not long afterwards he was reunited with McCartney and Starr for the creation of an exhaustive three-part release of a Beatles anthology--which featured alternative takes, rare tracks and a John Lennon demo called \"Free as a Bird,\" that the three surviving Beatles completed in the studio. The song went on to become the group's 34th Top 10 single. After that, however, Harrison largely became a homebody, keeping himself busy with gardening and his cars at his expansive and restored home in Henley-on-Thames in south Oxfordshire, England. Still, the ensuing years were not completely stress-free. In 1997, Harrison, a longtime smoker, was successfully treated for throat cancer. Eighteen months later, his life was again put on the line when a deranged 33-year-old Beatles fan somehow managed to circumvent Harrison's intricate security system and broke into his home, attacking the musician and his wife Olivia with a knife. Harrison was treated for a collapsed lung and minor stab wounds. Olivia suffered several cuts and bruises. In May 2001, Harrison's cancer returned. There was lung surgery, but doctors soon discovered the cancer had spread to his brain. That autumn, he traveled to the US for treatment and was eventually hospitalized at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA. He died November 29, 2001, at ex-bandmate McCartney's house in Los Angeles, at aged 58, with his wife and son at his side. Just one year after his death, Harrison's final studio album, \"Brainwashed,\" was released. It was produced by Lynne, Harrison's son Dhani Harrison and Harrison himself, and featured a collection of songs he'd been working at the time of his death. Dhani finished putting the album together and it was released in November of 2002.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjE0NzAzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjQzMzU3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365600","name":"George Harrison","nicknames":["Magpie"],"idIMDB":"nm0365600"},"actorId":"nm0365600","character":"George","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028941","main":true},{"actorName":"Ringo Starr","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0823592","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1Mjc1NzkwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTU4MzI2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 July 1940","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, Merseyside, England, UK","birthName":"Richard Starkey","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Ringo Starr is a British musician, actor, director, writer, and artist best known as the drummer of The Beatles who also coined the title 'A Hard day's Night' for The Beatles' first movie. He was born Richard Starkey on July 7, 1940, in a small two-storey house in the working class area of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. His father, Richard Starkey, was a former dockworker turned baker; his mother, Elsie (Gleave) Starkey, was a bakery worker. His parents divorced when he was three and he and his mother, Elsie, moved to another home in Liverpool. While attending Silas Infants' Schools he suffered from many afflictions that basically ruined his education: he had constant abdominal pains, was once diagnosed with a ruptured appendix that led to an inflamed peritoneum, which also led to one of his first surgeries. Ringo was in a coma, and his recovery took a couple of months, during which more operations were performed, and he was known to be accident-prone. Shortly after he came out of the coma, he was trying to offer a toy bus to another boy in an adjoining bed, but fell and suffered from a concussion. When he finally was able to go back to school, he learned that he was far behind in his studies. At age 13 he caught a cold that turned into chronic pleurisy, causing him another stay at a hospital in Liverpool. A few lung complications followed, which resulted in a treatment in yet another children's hospital, this time until 1955. Meanwhile, Richard's mother Elsie had married Harry Graves, the man who her son referred to as a \"step-ladder\". At the age of 15 he could barely read or write, although he had aptitude for practical subjects such as woodwork and mechanics. At that time he dropped out of school and got his first job was as a delivery boy for British Rail. His second job was a barman on a ferry to New Brighton, and his next was as a trainee joiner at Henry Hunt & Sons. Ringo injured his finger on the first day of his new job, and then he decided to become a drummer. His dream came true, when his stepfather bought him a new drum kit, and Richard promised to be the best drummer ever. In 1957, together with Eddie Miles, he started his own band called 'Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group'. At that time he became known as Ritchie, and eventually became caught in the Liverpool's Skiffle craze. Although he was self-taught, he was a good time-keeper, and developed an original beat with his signature accentuations, due to his left-handed manner of playing on the right-handed drum set. He traveled from band to band, but he eventually landed a spot with \"Raving Texans\", which was a backing band for Rory Storm, later known as \"Rory Storm & The Hurricanes\", a popular band at that time Liverpool. Rory Storm encouraged Richard to enhance his career by legally changing his name to Ringo Starr. The Hurricanes topped the bill at one of Liverpool's clubs, where The Beatles also had a gig. Ringo's group was at times sharing popularity with The Beatles and Gerry and the Pacemakers. He wanted to leave The Hurricanes to join another group called \"The Seniors.\" Before Ringo, The Beatles tried several other drummers. At one point they were so desperate, that they even invited strangers from the audience to fill the position. Then came Pete Best who was not considered by the other band members to be the greatest drummer, and they were keen to recruit Ringo as his replacement. On June 6, 1962, at the Abbey Road studios, The Beatles passed Martin's audition with the exception of Pete Best. George Martin liked them, but recommended the change of a drummer. Being asked by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison; Epstein fired Pete Best. After a mutual decision the band was completed with Ringo Starr. Ringo contributed to their first hit in September of 1962, when The Beatles recorded Love Me Do, which charted in UK, and reached the top of the US singles chart. Ringo's steady and reliable drumming became essential in their studio sessions, as well as in their numerous and exhausting live performances across the world. Ringo's positive disposition as well as his drumming style played the pivotal role in shaping the famous image and music style of The Beatles as they are now known to the world, under the management of Brian Epstein and music producer George Martin. Ringo filled the position of a drummer for The Beatles in the most critical time of the band's formation. He quickly connected with the other three members of The Beatles, and contributed to their music and creativity with his easy-going personality, light humour, reliable drumming and inventive musicianship. All four members were charismatic and individually talented artists, they sparked each other from the beginning. Eventually they made a much better group effort under the thorough management by Brian Epstein whose coaching helped consolidate their talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork. Starr had dreamed of becoming a professional actor since his younger years. He wanted to be in movies probably more so than the other members of The Beatles. In 1964, during the first months of Beatlemania, Ringo coined the phrase 'A Hard Day's Night' which soon became the official title of the Beatles' first movie, in replacement for the working title 'Beatlemania'. Ringo received great reviews for his performance in A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help! (1965). At first, Ringo did not have a songwriting career, although he had no problem with his name recognition, however, he had a problem with getting his songs noticed. At that time he got help from his friends; John and Paul wrote a song or two for him to sing on their albums, such as \"Boys\", \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"Honey Don't\", and \"Yellow Submarine\". During his eight-year career with The Beatles, Ringo wrote two original songs: \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus' Garden\" for which he also sang the lead vocals. Besides his drumming, Ringo's voice was recorded on many of the most popular Beatle's songs, contributing to their unique sound and tight harmonies. He had a hectic solo career during the 1970s, after the breakup of The Beatles. However, Ringo eventually emerged as a steady performer, and sustained a very popular solo career, turning out a dozen chart-topping hit songs and eight best-selling albums. He made a famous appearance together with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, and other popular musicians in the landmark 'Concert for Bangladesh' in 1971. His 1973 solo release \"Ringo\" was the last album to feature all four living Beatles, although not on the same song. He also appeared in various TV shows, including his own special, Ringo (1978), and a TV mini-series, Princess Daisy (1983), with his wife Barbara. In 1984 he did narration for the children's series Thomas & Friends (1984). During the 1980s, after having a long period of troubles with alcohol, Ringo and his wife attended a rehabilitation clinic, and came back to the scene sober. He made the All-Starr Band tour of America and Japan. The tour was so popular that he formed another All-Starr Band lineup in 1992, and began an American and European tour in June of that year. Since then Ringo Starr has been enjoying a continuous career as the leader of the All-Starr Band. In 1994, along with George Harrison and Paul McCartney, the three surviving members of The Beatles, reunited and produced Lennon's previously unknown song 'Free as a Bird'. It was preserved by 'Yoko Ono' on a tape recording made by John Lennon in 1977. The song was re-arranged and re-mixed with the voices of three surviving members, and became an international hit. 'Free as a Bird' was also included in The Beatles Anthology TV documentary which was watched by 420 million people in 1995. Ringo, Paul and George sang their new songs, in addition to mixing their voices and music arrangements to John Lennon demos. Ringo's old friend and band-mate George Harrison passed away on November 29, 2001, after a long battle against lung cancer. The following year, on the anniversary of Harrison's death, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton appeared in a Concert For George, to raise money for the support of Harrison's legacy in exploration of alternative lifestyles, views and philosophies. Starr also supported charitable organizations with consideration to those who have special needs. Ringo Starr updated the role of a drummer in popular music, he made drummer an equal partner to the lead musicians, thus changing the whole paradigm in how the public saw drummers. His original performing style evolved from adjusting his natural left-handed manner of playing to the right-handed drum set, and allowing his left hand lead in weaving a pattern tightly intertwined with the music of other players, and adding such enhancements as unusual accents and stops. Ringo's musical originality as well as his inventive drumming patterns, time signatures and accentuations became essential to the sound of The Beatles. His on-stage presence and acting talent as well as his humor and musicianship was the essential part in formation and remarkable career of The Beatles. He was married to his long-time girlfriend, Maureen Cox, from 1965 - 1975, and they had three children: Zak Starkey, Jason, and Lee. The couple broke up in July of 1975, and he married actress Barbara Bach. Ringo Starr divides his time between his residences in England, in Switzerland and his home in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1Mjc1NzkwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTU4MzI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0823592","name":"Ringo Starr","nicknames":["Ritchie"],"idIMDB":"nm0823592"},"actorId":"nm0823592","character":"Ringo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028942","main":true},{"actorName":"Wilfrid Brambell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104183","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 March 1912","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","birthName":"Henry Wilfrid Brambell","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Wilfrid Brambell was born on 22 March 1912, in Dublin, Ireland.

The son of a publican, he never finished high school, leaving at age 14 and living a rather wanderlust adolescent life as messenger, office boy, carpenter apprentice, etc. Later, he went to night school and studied industrial design in order to become a draughtsman. Interest in acting happened by accident and, eventually, Rossington joined a local theatre group. He trained seriously at the Bristol Old Vic and began appearing in both straight plays (\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\") and musicals (\"Salad Days\") by the mid-50s. Within a few years, he had extended his visability to films and TV, setting up his rather bumbling persona as \"Private Cupcake\" on the TV comedy series, The Army Game (1957). Along with roles in a few of the zany \"Carry On...\" slapstick films, Rossington established himself firmly as a comedy performer with I Only Arsked! (1958), Crooks Anonymous (1962) and Nurse on Wheels (1963), representing a few of his farcical credits. Yet his finest creation was arguably in the \"kitchen sink\" drama, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), as Albert Finney's sensible, down-to-earth, blue-collar pal. Though he never attained outright stardom, Rossington became a reliable, familiar mug with minor roles in such epic British and U.S. films as Saint Joan (1957), The Longest Day (1962), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines or How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 hours 11 minutes (1965), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968) and Young Winston (1972), not to mention the equally epic TV miniseries, I, Claudius (1976) and Masada (1981). Rossington's greatest impression would lie in musical theatre, especially in his later career. Such spirited roles in \"Peter Pan\" (as \"Starkey\"), \"My Fair Lady\" (as \"Alfred Doolittle\"), \"Annie Get Your Gun\" (as \"Charlie Davenport\"), \"Pickwick: The Musical\" (as \"Tony Weller\"), \"Guys and Dolls\" (as \"Nathan Detroit\") and, lastly, as Beauty's father in \"Beauty and the Beast\", made him an endearing favorite in the West End.

Throughout the sixties and seventies he was one of the busiest men on television, both as a performer and scriptwriter. The comedian Marty Feldman won the Golden Rose Award with a Junkin script in 1972 and with Barry Cryer and others, Junkin contributed to many of the Morecambe and Wise specials for the BBC. He also wrote, with Bill Tidy, The Fosdyke Saga, and The Grumbleweeds for radio. He had a prolific career in the cinema playing a variety of straight and comic roles and described himself as easy to cast: \"I look like the bloke next door,\" he said. \"I always seem to be wearing one of those sheepskin coats.\" In the latter part of his career, Junkin became disillusioned with show business, particularly television. He fell out with a producer - he never revealed which one - over the writing of a game show for which he had devised the format. Litigation cost him £70,000 and he was also in debt to the tax man to the tune of £120,000. He did, however, return to scriptwriting and contributed to The Crazy World of Joe Pasquale (1998) and The Impressionable Jon Culshaw (2004) and he was much in demand as an after dinner speaker. Close friend, former Radio 1 disc jockey Dave Lee Travis, said: If you were in conversation with John, you were always in a state of hilarity. He had no airs and graces.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYwODAyNDQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg3MjU2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432729","name":"John Junkin","idIMDB":"nm0432729"},"actorId":"nm0432729","character":"Shake","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0555204","main":true},{"actorName":"Victor Spinetti","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0818920","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2Njg0MjI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk3Mjc5Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 September 1929","placeOfBirth":" Cwm, Ebbw Vale, Gwent, Wales, UK","birthName":"Vittorio Georgio Andrea Spinetti","bio":"Comic eccentric and gifted raconteur, Victor Spinetti was born in Wales on September 2, 1929, the son of Giuseppe Spinetti and Lily (Watson) Spinetti. He was educated at Monmouth School. Initially interested in a teaching degree, he turned to acting instead and studied for the stage at the College of Music and Drama, Cardiff. A familiar stage presence in London's West End, his roles included \"Expresso Bongo\" with Paul Scofield and Leonard Bernstein's \"Candide\". He also spent six years with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop. Noticed in some of his more important theater pieces such as \"The Hostage\", \"Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'be\", \"Henry IV, Parts I & II\", and \"Every Man in His Humour\", his triumph in \"Oh! What a Lovely War\" led to Broadway and both the Tony and Theatre World awards. In the late 1960s, Victor co-starred in \"The Odd Couple\" with Jack Klugman when it toured London. A noted performer with the Royal Shakespeare Company, he has been equally adept in theatre musicals, providing delicious villainy as Fagin in \"Oliver!\" and Captain Hook in \"Peter Pan\". A theatre director of both legit and musical plays as well, Victor's one man show \"A Very Private Diary\" has played all over the world. At age 70+, Victor is still quite active on stage, more recently playing Baron Bomburst in the musical version of \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" in 2003, and \"The Merry Widow\" in 2004. In 1960s film, Victor became a vital part of the \"Beatlemania\" phenomenon earning international recognition as he added to the insanity of three of The Beatles' cult vehicles: A Hard Day's Night (1964), Help! (1965) and their hour-long Magical Mystery Tour (1967). A TV favorite in England, he scored in many comedy series over the years. He is an excellent conversationalist and storyteller who has often extended his talents into writing.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2Njg0MjI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk3Mjc5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0818920","name":"Victor Spinetti","nicknames":["Vic"],"idIMDB":"nm0818920"},"actorId":"nm0818920","character":"T.V.

He grew up in Liverpool and had his senior education at Liverpool College. On leaving school he tried his hand at a few things including working with his father in the family jewelers business 'Green & Guyler'. However, he then left home to go to Bristol theological college to become an Anglican Minister, in those days Deryck was not a Catholic. It was not long before it became obvious to the 'powers-that-be' that he would make a better actor than a Parson!!!! So, he eventually joined the Liverpool Repertory Company in 1935 which became his training ground for a very successful career in theatre, radio and television. During the war, however, he was called up to join the RAF Police and served there for a time before being invalided out and then rejoined his profession. As all the theatres had been closed down due to wartime, he was sent out on ENSA (Entertainment National Services Association) to entertain the troops. It was during this time that he met and married his wife Paddy, who was also working on ENSA with her two sisters as a three handed singing harmony act, 'The Lennox Sisters'. They were married on 15th Sep 1941 so, at the time of his death Deryck and Paddy had just celebrated their 58th wedding anniversary. They had two sons, Peter, born 26th April 1943 during the war and Chris, born after the war on 15th June 1948. Soon after their son Peter was born, Deryck converted to the Catholic faith and became an active member of the 'Catholic Stage Guild'. They also had another wedding ceremony, as Paddy was also a Catholic, and son Peter was in the front row of the church. Just after the war, in 1946, Deryck joined the famous war time radio show ITMA ('It's That Man Again') and was with the show until its finish in 1949, due to the death of its star Tommy Handley. It was during this time that he was renowned for bringing to the radio, for the first time, the Liverpudlian accent with his immortal character \"Frisby Dyke\". Not long after this television started and Deryck began pursuing his very successful career in this new medium of entertainment. Due to the excellent quality of his voice he started in television, as many did, doing 'voice-overs' for many, many commercials which was his 'bread and butter', but then, he went on to become as well known for his face as he was for his voice in many TV series including Three Live Wires (1961), Room at the Bottom (1966), Best of Enemies (1968) and the well known Sykes (1972) series with Eric Sykes, Hattie Jacques and Richard Wattis. There were many other series that followed, supporting such other stars as Michael Bentine in It's a Square World (1960) and Harry Worth in his own series and then, of course, the TV series he's probably best known for, Please Sir! (1968) as the cantankerous school janitor 'Norman Potter'!! It was in 1982 that he went out to New Zealand to star in a series written by an English TV scriptwriter Vince Powell called \"An Age Apart\"; it only went to 'air' in New Zealand. So, after a long successful career lasting over 50 years he then decided to retire 'down under' in Australia to be near his younger son Chris and his family, Deryck's three grandchildren, Paul, Mark and Cathryn. Deryck and his wife Paddy arrived in Brisbane on 5th November 1993, and lived in the tree-lined suburb of Ashgrove until about September of 1997. In October of that year, due to a few unfortunate falls at home attributed to his frailty and ailing legs, he had to go into a nursing home to be cared for, his wife Paddy being too small and frail herself to care for him. Regrettably due to his frailty; he had to be content with a wheelchair to get around. Paddy moved to 'Forest Place' Retirement Village, attached to the nursing home, and naturally, visited him daily. The rest of the family too often visited him in the nursing home where he was looked after admirably by the nursing home staff at 'Forest Place' until the evening of 7 October 1999 when he passed away very peacefully at about eight o'clock whilst wife Paddy and son Chris with his wife, were at his bedside to say their final 'Goodbyes'. His funeral service was held at St. Mark's Catholic Church, Inala on the 13 October 1999 and he was cremated at Mt. Gravatt Cemetery. In 1995 there was a wonderful 10 minute tribute to Deryck, made by Danny Baker and the BBC, which the family used as a part of the eulogy delivered by his son Chris at his funeral service at St. Mark's. Deryck's wife Paddy also passed away on 6 January 2002 and their ashes are now buried side by side in the \"Guyler\" family 'garden seat' estate in the peaceful surroundings of \"Mount Thompson Memorial Gardens\" in the Brisbane suburb of Holland Park.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MTIyMDk1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODkzMDEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0349899","name":"Deryck Guyler","idIMDB":"nm0349899"},"actorId":"nm0349899","character":"Police Inspector","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0555207","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Vernon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894710","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTcyNDc2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg1MzUyMjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 March 1925","placeOfBirth":" Reading, Berkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Richard Evelyn Vernon","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"One of the most memorable of actors, distinguished-looking Richard Vernon completed his training at the Central School of Speech and Drama. From the early 1950's, he enjoyed a very successful career on the stage in London in productions ranging from 'Peter Pan' (as Mr.Darling) to Noël Coward's 'Hay Fever' (as Richard Greatham). During the 1960's, he appeared in supporting roles in several prestigious motion pictures, including Village of the Damned (1960), The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964) and Goldfinger (1964). Richard was a far more consummate scene stealer on television. Looking older than his years and with his dignified bearing, he specialized in impersonating military or aristocratic types and senior public servants. He enjoyed a successful run in Upstairs, Downstairs (1971), followed by The Duchess of Duke Street (1976), but was ultimately at his best in gleeful old rogues and slightly dishevelled or befuddled eccentrics. He also had a way of delivering even the funniest of lines totally deadpan and matter-of-fact. He was particularly droll as Lord Bartlesham in the Ripping Yarns (1976) episode 'Roger of the Raj'. Probably his most popular role, however, was that of galactic fjord builder Slartibartfast in The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy (1981), a part to which he had originally lent his voice in a 1978 radio serial. A truly unique, immensely likeable actor, Richard Vernon plied his craft until two years prior to his death from Parkinson's Disease.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTcyNDc2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg1MzUyMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894710","name":"Richard Vernon","idIMDB":"nm0894710"},"actorId":"nm0894710","character":"Man on train","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0555208","main":true},{"actorName":"Edward Malin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0539625","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"October1894","placeOfBirth":" Hackney, London, England, UK","birthName":"Edward Ernest Malin","bio":"Edward Malin was born in October 1894 in Hackney, London, England as Edward Ernest Malin.
