Richard Haydn had a laborious start to his show business career, selling tickets in the box office of London's Daly Theatre. This was followed by an unsuccessful stint with a comedy act in musical revue. For a change of pace, he became overseer of a Jamaican banana plantation only to see it wiped out by a hurricane. Returning home, he appeared in the 1926 West End production of 'Betty of Mayfair' and, soon after, also began to act on radio. It was in this medium, where he first found success, creating his signature character, the perpetually befuddled nasally-voiced fish expert and mother's boy Edwin Carp. Haydn later immortalised the character in a book, The Journal of Edwin Carp. The Carp routine opened the door for Haydn to appear with Beatrice Lillie on Broadway in 'Noel Coward (I)''s 'Set to Music' (1939) and this, in turn, resulted in a contract with 20th Century Fox. While his screen debut in Charley's Aunt (1941) was relatively straight-laced, he was more often seen in comedic roles where his lugubrious face and dignified, sometimes unctuous presence could be employed to scene-stealing effect. His notable characterisations in this vein include the over-enunciating Professor Oddly in Ball of Fire (1941), Rogers the butler in And Then There Were None (1945) and Mr. Wilson in Cluny Brown (1946). He essayed a rare villainous role as the odious Earl of Radcliffe in the period drama Forever Amber (1947) and was back in his best form as Mr.Appleton in Sitting Pretty (1948). In The Late George Apley (1947), he played the character of Horatio Willing, 'with a broad edge of wheezy burlesque' (Bosley Crowther, New York Times, March 21 1947). In the late 40's, Haydn made a brief foray into directing. Of his three films for Paramount, the Bing Crosby vehicle Mr. Music (1950) enjoyed the best critical reviews. Among his later appearances on screen, that of Trapp family friend and promoter Max Detweiler in The Sound of Music (1965), is the one which most often comes to mind. Over the years, Haydn also made an impression as a voice actor in animated cartoons, notably on Warner Brothers Looney Tunes ('Super-Rabbit', 1943) and as the Caterpillar from Alice au pays des merveilles (1951). He had frequent guest roles on television and starred in one of the best-remembered episodes of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone (1959), 'A Thing About Machines' (1960), as the pedantic, machine-hating egocentric Bartlett Finchley. He also caricatured a Japanese businessman in an episode of Bewitched (1964). In private life, Richard Haydn was a rather reclusive individual who liked horticulture, shunned interviews and was never particularly integral to the closely-knit British colony in Hollywood.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkxNzM0NTY2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ3NjAxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370821","name":"Richard Haydn","idIMDB":"nm0370821"},"actorId":"nm0370821","character":"Caterpillar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012254","main":true},{"actorName":"Sterling Holloway","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001359","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MDIwNzg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU1ODcxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 January 1905","placeOfBirth":" Cedartown, Georgia, USA","birthName":"Sterling Price Holloway Jr.","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Popular American character actor of amusing appearance and voice whose long career led from dozens of highly enjoyable onscreen performances to world-wide familiarity as the voice of numerous Walt Disney animated films. Born in the American Deep South to grocer Sterling P. Holloway Sr. and Rebecca Boothby Holloway, he had a younger brother, Boothby. Holloway spent his early years as an actor playing comic juveniles on the stage. His bushy reddish-blond hair and trademark near-falsetto voice made him a natural for sound pictures, and he acted in scores of talkies, although he had made his picture debut in silents. His physical image and voice relegated him almost exclusively to comic roles, but in 1945, director Lewis Milestone cast him more or less against type in the classic war film A Walk in the Sun (1945), where Holloway's portrayal of a reluctant soldier was quite notable. He played frequently on television, becoming familiar to baby-boomers in a recurring role as Uncle Oscar on Adventures of Superman (1952), and later in television series of his own. His later work as the voice of numerous characters in Disney cartoons brought him new audiences and many fans, especially for his voicing of beloved Winnie the Pooh. He died in 1992.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MDIwNzg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU1ODcxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001359","name":"Sterling Holloway","idIMDB":"nm0001359"},"actorId":"nm0001359","character":"Cheshire Cat","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012248","main":true},{"actorName":"Jerry Colonna","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0173160","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY4NWU0ZDEtZDg1Yy00MjQ0LThlZWItMGFiMzkzMTgzNjhjL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA4NDY2Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR5,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 September 1904","placeOfBirth":" Boston, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Gerardo Luigi Colonna","bio":"Comedian, composer, songwriter (\"At Dusk\", \"I Came to Say Goodbye\"), author and trombonist, educated in high school, then a trombonist with the Columbia Symphony (1931-1936).

She dabbled on the stage for a time before coming to California to try her luck on the screen. Heather was 20 years old when she landed a bit part for the 1929 film, Bulldog Drummond (1929). Although she didn't know it at the time, she would become a staple of that particular series eight years hence. That movie would be her only foray onto celluloid for two years. When Heather did return, she did so in 1931's Night in Montmartre (1931). Not only did she land a part, but it was the leading role in the picture, starring as Annette Lefevre. Later that year, she again landed the leading role in the acclaimed The Hound of the Baskervilles (1931). Throughout the 1930s, Heather's services were in high demand. She kept very busy in such productions as Men of Steel (1932), Charlie Chan's Greatest Case (1933), Orient Express (1934), and Daniel Boone (1936). In 1937, she began playing Phyllis Clavering in the serial about Bulldog Drummond. Audiences delighted in catching the latest adventures of Drummond. After the last Drummond film, Arrest Bulldog Drummond (1938) in 1939, Heather went on her way in other films. Although she didn't have the leading role, she did appear in top movies such as 1940's Kitty Foyle (1940) and Pride and Prejudice (1940) and in 1943's Cry 'Havoc' (1943). After Lifeboat (1944) in 1944, Heather wasn't seen again on the silver screen until The Saxon Charm (1948) in 1948. As with other actresses, Heather's time had come and gone. Her last appearance anywhere was in 1979's television mini-series, Backstairs at the White House (1979) when she played President 'Harry Truman''s mother-in-law. On December 13, 1986, Heather died in Santa Barbara, California, of cancer. She was 77 years old.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgwOTU5MTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE1OTgwMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0029456","name":"Heather Angel","idIMDB":"nm0029456"},"actorId":"nm0029456","character":"Alice's Sister","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028820","main":true},{"actorName":"Joseph Kearns","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444012","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0Njc4NzU1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI2MjU5MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 February 1907","placeOfBirth":" Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","bio":"Joseph Kearns was born on February 12, 1907 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.
