He became a popular and successful rodeo star, winning national championships. In 1914, after touring the U.S. in a Wild West show, he came to Hollywood and got work as a stuntman. He had a handsome, stalwart quality that, along with his skills as a cowhand, quickly gained him the attention of producers and studios. Born John Stone, he changed his name to Hartford Hoxie and then to Art Hoxie when producer Anthony J. Xydias of Sunset Productions signed him for a series of low-budget Westerns. By 1921 Hoxie was successful enough to catch the eye of Universal Pictures, which hired him away and placed in him in more prestigious westerns. Although not a star of the magnitude of Douglas Fairbanks or Charles Chaplin, Hoxie was a prominent name among western stars. His career faded quickly after sound, as even though he looked the part of a cowboy, his skills did not extend to sounding like one (he could barely read). He continued to appear, albeit in smaller roles, well into the 1930s, when he left Hollywood to star in his own western-style circus. By the end of the 1930s he had retired to a ranch in Oklahoma, where he lived out his days in obscurity. He died in Kansas in 1965 at the age of 80. He was survived by his brother, lesser-known cowboy actor Al Hoxie.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQ5NjJiYjYtZDQ0YS00OTNmLWJlZDEtODAwZGFmN2NiN2ZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398300","name":"Jack Hoxie","idIMDB":"nm0398300"},"actorId":"nm0398300","character":"Jack Benton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ena Gregory","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339803","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 April 1906","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Ena Gregory was born on April 18, 1906 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

She was possessed of a fine singing voice. and after graduation from school journeyed to New York to pursue an operatic career. However, not long after her arrival she apparently changed her mind about her career path, and before long she was appearing in two-reel comedies for Vitagraph. Her career progressed steadily, and she was soon working in full-length films and serials. She soon journeyed to Hollywood, and began appearing in westerns, often with Hoot Gibson. She also became a fixture in action serials. In 1920 she married cowboy actor Jack Hoxie, and they appeared in several films together, but divorced five years later. With the coming of sound she began appearing in character roles rather than the leading or featured roles she was used to, and the films she appeared in were often for the cheap independent market. She seemed to specialize in westerns, and with few exceptions her pictures up until her retirement in 1953 were all in that genre.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEzYjViMjUtMTM2Yy00ZjExLTgxYWYtNDllMGVmYjUwZmY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756814","name":"Marin Sais","idIMDB":"nm0756814"},"actorId":"nm0756814","character":"Mother Owen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Francis Ford","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0285643","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA3ZTkxODUtOTRkMy00Yzk5LWIzOTQtMWQ0YTIwMDk0YThmL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 August 1881","placeOfBirth":" Portland, Maine, USA","birthName":"Frank Thomas Feeney","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Elder brother of the director John Ford and himself a screen director (and John's erstwhile mentor) until the advent of sound. He had also acted in his own films and those of other directors, but turned to acting exclusively circa 1929. As actor, he would provide convincing portrayals of men of authority - men sometimes ruthless if not downright unsavory. (See him as the Republican judge in his brother John's The Informer (1935).) But he also had an ample feel for light comedy. (See him in John's The Quiet Man (1952), as the village elder who - almost in the manner of slapstick - rouses himself from his very deathbed to witness the film's donnybrook dénouement.)","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA3ZTkxODUtOTRkMy00Yzk5LWIzOTQtMWQ0YTIwMDk0YThmL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0285643","name":"Francis Ford","idIMDB":"nm0285643"},"actorId":"nm0285643","character":"Black Roger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James T.
