When Ingmar Bergman became head of the Malmö City Theater he asked her to join him there and with him as a director she played the role of Margareta in Goethe's 'Faust'. Bergman also gave her supporting roles in his movies, most notably the mute woman in The Seventh Seal (1957). She followed up on a few offers from abroad but the roles wasted her screen presence. Bergman once again gave her an offer she couldn't refuse, to direct a movie. Paradis d'été (1977) received a lot of prise all over the world. Time Magazine considered it one of the four best non-US movies of 1978. Her appearances in movies has been rare but she gave a wonderful appearance in the children's TV show Kaspar i Nudådalen (2001). Lindblom has for many years worked for The Royal Dramatic Theater, appearing in plays by August Strindberg or William Shakespeare. In 2002 she received a Guldbagge award for her lifetime achievments in movies.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkZDkxMzItOWUyMS00OGUwLWFlZTUtZDQ2MGMwMzc5ZGQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc4MzI2NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511458","name":"Gunnel Lindblom","idIMDB":"nm0511458"},"actorId":"nm0511458","character":"Valeria, en gift fru","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Helena Reuterblad","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0720709","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 October 1935","placeOfBirth":" Stockholm, Sweden","bio":"Helena Reuterblad was born on October 6, 1935 in Stockholm, Sweden.

After 1936 he became a freelancer and worked on all the theatres in Stockholm, particularly so for Per-Axel Branner at Nya Teatern and he also toured around Sweden. In 1951 he started his own theatre, Alléteatern, together with 'Oscar Lindgren' and ran it until 1958 when he was hired by Malmö Stadsteater until his early death. His breakthrough came in 1930 in a play by 'John van Druten' where he showed his adaptiveness and playfullnes on the stage. His vitality and charm made him an excellent comedy actor but his skills also made him an impressive drama actor, for example as Mio in Maxwell Anderson's play 'Winterset', as Earl in Clifford Odets' play 'Clash by Night' or as Gayev in Anton Chekhov's play 'The Cherry Orchard'. Among his movie roles Bombi Bitt och jag (1936) and Den blomstertid... (1940) are the most noteworthy.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0481270","name":"Sture Lagerwall","idIMDB":"nm0481270"},"actorId":"nm0481270","character":"Bernardo, en bärare","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0130344","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130344","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["56 min"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["Live"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.5","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"58","type":"TV Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0019735","name":"Sveriges Radio"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["swedish tv theater","live performance","live broadcast"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:14:01"}}
