This Aries/Taurean is one of few authentic New Orleans Creoles left as she is part African American, French, Native American, & Italian. She is simply a rare mixture all across the board from her unique ethnic composition to her national, underground holiday of a birthday \"4-20\", which lands her on an extremely rare zodiac cusp that among other things, contributes to her being quite the interesting person. At the age of 7, she, her mother, and her 3 month old sister moved to Oakland, Ca via Greyhound with only $200 to their names. Upon arrival, they lived in various women's shelters throughout California's Bay Area. Over the next 8 years, she and her family moved back and forth between a number of cities in both California and Louisiana including, Berkley, Oakland, Concord, Pittsburg, San Leandro, New Orleans, Metairie, Algiers, Gretna, Harvey, and many wards and areas among them. She and her family moved around nearly every 6 months, never longer than 1 year in any given place. In 2005, a mere 7 months after moving back to New Orleans from San Leandro, Ca, Hurricane Katrina forced her and her family to live in Prairieville, La and later Chalmette, La. She and her family were able to move back to New Orleans in late 2006. Due to the constant relocating her entire life, Dominique has attended a whopping total of 23 schools from Kindergarten through 12th grade. In the 9th grade, at age 14, Dominique got a large role in her first play and absolutely loved it. The play was for Victory Outreach church in Oakland, Ca that boasted an audience of roughly 400 people every night. Not bad for a church play. This is what led her to join her high school's drama club in 10th grade and land a lead role in her school's play that she'd never get to perform due to once again relocating. Upon graduating high school with honors in 2007, Dominique chose to seriously pursue becoming a professional actress. She started out taking acting classes with various coaches in the New Orleans community and soon began working in a number of micro budget independent films, shorts, student films, and another play along with dancing and modeling in 3 music videos; \"Love Is Free\"- Sheryl Crow, \"For A Minute\"- B.G feat. T.I. and \"Bubblegum\"- B.G. She hit a milestone in 2008 when she landed principal roles in 2 sketches of the never to be released \"Mike Epps Comedy Show\". Upon becoming pregnant in 2009, she took a little over a year break from pursuing her career to focus on her baby and college. In mid 2010, with the immense support of her mother, she decided to continue pursuing her career and despite the negative predictions of others, her career has soared more since having a child, higher and faster than ever before. In June, 2010 she landed her first principal role in a feature film that led her to film for 2 weeks in Wilmington, NC. The film is called \"Bolden!\" and she both dances and acts as a fairy like teenage nymph in this unique piece. Her next role would be her biggest and most exciting yet. She landed a role on the 4th season of the wildly popular hit BET television series \"The Game\". She appeared as \"Sheila Flores\", the ditsy yet spicy replacement assistant to one of the show's leading characters, \"Malik Wright\". From there, things only got better. In 2011 she landed a principal role in a national commercial of which she is very proud as it is in honor of the new Martin Luther King monument, a more than worthy cause. The commercial is sponsored by Chevrolet. Her most exciting role to date is one she landed in the upcoming film \"Freelancers\" starring 50 Cent, Robert De Niro, and Forest Whitaker. She was tremendously honored to act in scenes alongside the ranks of Oscar winner Forest Whitaker and hip hop mogul 50 Cent. She again plays a feisty, mouthy Latina character, but this time with an east coast, \"hood\" flare. She's currently gearing up to work on a film called \"\"Headshot\"\" (working title) as a sexy waitress. She will be acting alongside the legendary \"\"Rocky\"\" star Sylvester Stallone. Dominique DuVernay plans to continue riding her wave of success into very flourishing acting and modeling careers. She has her sights set on becoming a household name and internationally recognized face by becoming an undeniable force in the world of entertainment. She aspires to be a positive role model and testimony that dreams do come true with hard work, perseverance, and faith. Dominique accredits 100% of her success to having a very supportive mother who always stressed the importance of God's presence in their lives. Without Him, they would have never made it through and out of the tough and unstable circumstances that plagued them for so many years. God has also blessed her with the ability to have the best of both worlds in that she is able to enjoy motherhood without having to give up or compromise her goals as an actress in the slightest. He has provided her with a loving mother who baby sits for every single audition and class Dominique has and every job she books, no matter how long the job keeps her away from home. These are all things she does not take for granted and these are the things that will insure nothing but success in her life and provide her with the means to achieve anything she may set out to do.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2795748","name":"Dominique DuVernay","nicknames":["Niquee"],"idIMDB":"nm2795748"},"actorId":"nm2795748","character":"Core Swing Dancer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1186795","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186795","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"07","month":"04","year":"2008","remarks":null},null],"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 31 min (91 min) (USA)","1 hr 30 min (90 min) (Toronto International) (Canada)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.2","metascore":"52","filmingLocations":[{"location":"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA"}],"awards":[{"award":"Atlanta Jewish Film Festival 2010","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Audience Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Narrative","names":[{"name":"Jerry Zaks","id":"nm0952360","role":"director"}]}]}]}],"votes":"95","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0241249","name":"Alexander/ Mitchell Productions"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["music business"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 07:58:15"}}
