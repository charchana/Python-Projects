He says the program was more like boot camp than college. Out of 2000 applicants, only 33 were accepted and Steve-O was one of them. However, after graduation, 10 were selected for the circus and this didn't include him. So he went back home to Albuquerque, New Mexico to film himself doing dangerous and stupid stunts for submission to skateboarding companies. Steve-O's relationship with Big Brother Magazine began in 1997 when they ran a side-bar article about him catching his face on fire when their Big Brother tour came through Albuquerque. In 1999 he moved from New Mexico to Florida. For six months he worked as a performer on Royal Carribean Cruise Lines and was then offered a job at the Hanneford Family Circus as a clown. During this time he was featured in several more issues of Big Brother Magazine and even filmed a part for the Big Brother video \"Boob\". This is when he became involved with Jackass. He says he did all his filming for the first season of Jackass within three days.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNTAzOTM2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjE5MDM4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0828177","name":"Steve-O","nicknames":["Squirt"],"idIMDB":"nm0828177"},"actorId":"nm0828177","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeff Tremaine","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871860","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MjQzMzg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODYxMjY2._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Jeff Tremaine was born a military brat and hustled from state to state until finally settling in Rockville, Maryland. There, he quickly gravitated towards the alternative world of skateboarding, BMX, reggae music, and art... pursuits that would shape a career to come. After attending Washington University, Tremaine headed out West, where he slid into the layout jockey position at Go magazine. From there, he became the art/editorial director for Big Brother. At the magazine, Tremaine, Spike Jonze, and Johnny Knoxville laid the seeds for jackass, a television series that would become a cultural phenomenon, spawning a franchise that includes jackass: the movie, jackass number two, jackass 2.5, and jackass 3D, which Paramount Pictures released in October 2010. Beyond jackass, Tremaine has created and executive produced a number of television series' including MTV's Wildboyz, Rob & Big, Nitro Circus, Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory, Dudesons in America, and the new series, Ridiculousness. In 2009, he produced Steve-O: Demise and Rise, an MTV documentary about addiction and the road to recovery. He went on to executive produce The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia, a feature-length documentary about a family of outlaws that Tribeca Film acquired and distributed theatrically in 2010. Most recently, Tremaine directed and produced ESPN 30 For 30's The Birth of Big Air, an inspirational documentary about BMX legend Mat Hoffman. He has also directed music videos for Turbonegro, Andrew WK, The Sahara Hot Nights, and Weezer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MjQzMzg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODYxMjY2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871860","name":"Jeff Tremaine","idIMDB":"nm0871860"},"actorId":"nm0871860","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0468895","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468895","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["45 min"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.4","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"260","type":"Video","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0098058","name":"J & N Media"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 08:07:59"}}
