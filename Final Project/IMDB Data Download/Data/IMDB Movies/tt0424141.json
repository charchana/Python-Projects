The vehicle that achieved it was Sam and Friends (1955), a late-night puppet show that was on after the 11:00 news in Washington DC. It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn't need to hide puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets and television would lead to separate projects that had different goals. The first one was his work on the The Jimmy Dean Show (1963) with the character Rowlf the Dog, the oldest clearly identified character that Henson Productions still uses. This show provided an income that allowed Jim to work on a pet project. That project was Time Piece (1965), a surrealistic short about time which was nominated for best live-action short Oscar. Henson shot to prominence when he was approached to use his muppets for the revolutionary educational show Sesame Street (1969). The show was a smash hit and his characters have become staples on public television. Unforetunately, this also led to Henson being typecast as only an entertainer for children. He sought to disprove that by being part of the initial crew of Saturday Night Live (1975), but his style and that of the creative staff simply didn't jibe. It was this circumstance that encouraged him to develop a variety show format that had the kind of sophisticated humor that \"Sesame Street (1969)\" didn't work with. No American broadcaster was interested, but British producer Lew Grade was. This led to The Muppet Show (1976). It initially struggled both in the ratings and in the search for guest stars, but in the second season it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made The Muppet Movie (1979), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie. The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy The Dark Crystal (1982), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work. The most successful TV work in the 1980s was Fraggle Rock (1983), a fantasy series specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible. During this time he also established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects. When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant The Storyteller (1987) series respectively attest to.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMzI3MjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMDk1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001345","name":"Jim Henson","idIMDB":"nm0001345"},"actorId":"nm0001345","character":"Himself - Performer / Kermit the Frog","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000604","main":true},{"actorName":"Jane Henson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1651395","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2NjkxOTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ0NDMzOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 June 1934","placeOfBirth":" Queens, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Jane Anne Nebel","bio":"Jane Henson was born on June 16, 1934 in Queens, New York City, New York, USA as Jane Anne Nebel.

His family moved to Montana in 1951, eventually settling in Oakland, California. As a teenager, he worked as an apprentice puppeteer at Children's Fairyland amusement park. He is one of the primary puppeteers responsible for the development of Jim Henson's Sesame Street (1969) and _\"The Muppet Show\" (1976)_ as well as over 75 other Muppet productions. 'George Lucas' originally contacted Henson to play the part of Yoda in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), but he recommended Oz for the part instead. He developed the character's trademark syntax, returning to voice and puppet the Jedi Master in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). He voiced the CGI character in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005), supporting the transition of the character's rendering to digital. In 2011, the Blu-Ray edition of The Phantom Menace replaced the puppet Yoda with CGI to match the other prequel films. He began a career of behind-the-camera puppet and live action filmmaking by co-directing The Dark Crystal (1982) with Henson. He went on to direct The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), What About Bob?

His parents Olga and Isaac, who were Jewish, emigrated to England in 1912 to escape the pogroms of their native land. The settled in London's End End, where Isaac managed a movie theater. Lew and his two brothers, Leslie and Bernard (who later took the name Delfont) attended the Rochelle Street School in Shoreditch. His formal education over, he became an agent for a clothing firm at the age of 15 but soon went into business for himself. His fate was changed when he won a Charleston competition at the Albert Hall in 1926. He took the name Grade (which was adopted by his brother Leslie) when he became a professional dancer, and as Lew Grade, the World Charleston Champion of 1926, made his way into show business. Lew Grade and his brother Leslie Grade founded a talent agency in 1933, which grew into the largest in the UK. With partner Joe Collins, father of Joan and Jackie Collins, the agency eventually represented some of the biggest and most prestigious stars in British show business, including Sir Ralph Richardson and Lord Laurence Olivier. His other brother Bernie, now Bernard (later Lord) Delfont, also made his way into show business, later becoming the head of the music industry behemoth EMI. (Lord Grade's own interests included Pye Records.) Entering television, Grade's production company ITC Entertainment was responsible for the iconic 1960s British TV series \"The Saint\" and \"The Prisoner.\" He acquired the independent production company AP Films in 1962, which produced the popular children's marionette adventure series \"Thunderbirds\" among others. AP Films also produced three feature films, and the live-action sci-fi series \"Space: 1999.\" As a movie producer, Grade helped finance the big screen incarnation of The Muppet Show, for which he was immortalized by Jim Henson, who made a Muppet in his image -- Dr Bunsen Honeydew. Henson also used Grade for the character of movie mogul Lew Lord (played by Orson Welles) in \"The Muppet Movie.\" Grade was the force behind the private British TV broadcasting network ATV, which he wanted to rival the BBC. The network featured extravagant 'quality' productions such as a live broadcast of \"Tosca\" from La Scala starring Maria Callas, which took up an entire evening's broadcast time. He produced director 'Franco Zefferelli' 's award-winning TV mini-series \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977), which provided a financial windfall when it was resold to the American market. The mini-series garnered a then-record $12 million licensing fee (approximately $39 million in 2005 dollars, when adjusted for inflation). On the downside, Grade's high-budget, 'all-star' film adaptation of Clive Cussler's best seller \"Raise the Titanic\" proved to be a monumental flop. A self-deprecating Grade remarked about laying this big egg, \"It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.\" Subsequent flops led Grade to abandon motion picture production. Grade was knighted in 1969 for his services towards promoting international trade, and was made a life peer (a baron) in 1976, both times under Harold Wilson's Labour Government. He was married to Kathleen Moody for 56 years, until his death. Lew and Kathleen adopted a son, Paul Dancer. Of his wife, Grade said, graciously, \"Marriage was the best business deal I ever made. After that, `Jesus of Nazareth' and 'The Muppets.'\" His nephew, Michael Grade, currently is the Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors. Lord Grade died in December 13, 1998. He was 92 years old.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0333528","name":"Lew Grade","idIMDB":"nm0333528"},"actorId":"nm0333528","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jerry Juhl","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432075","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 June 1938","placeOfBirth":" St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","birthName":"Jerome Ravn Juhl","bio":"Jerry Juhl became the first full-time employee of Jim Henson Co. in 1961 after meeting Henson at a puppeteer's convention.
