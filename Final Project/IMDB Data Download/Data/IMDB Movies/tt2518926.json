Educated at prep-school, he first made a serious commitment to his craft during his days at Pennsylvania's Franklin and Marshall College. Working summers with the nearby Fulton Repertory Theatre at Lancaster in the heart of Amish country, Williams performed the classics as well as contemporary dramas and musicals. After graduating, Williams--whose first name, incidentally, is a family surname on his mother's side--headed for Manhattan where he understudied the Danny Zuko role in \"Grease.\" After working in the The Andrews Sisters musical \"Over Here,\" he made his film debut as a cop in Deadly Hero (1975), then returned to \"Grease,\" this time in the starring role. While he took leaves for two small film roles, in The Ritz (1976) and The Eagle Has Landed (1976), it was his stage work in \"Grease\" that led to his cinematic breakthrough in Hair (1979). Spotted by director Milos Forman, Williams was asked to read for the role of Berger, the hippie. It took 13 auditions to land the part, but the film's release catapulted Williams into stardom. He then portrayed a GI on the make in Steven Spielberg's 1941 (1979) and starred in the romantic comedy Why Would I Lie? (1980) before tackling the role of Danny Ciello, the disillusioned New York City cop who blew the whistle on his corrupt colleagues in Sidney Lumet's Prince of the City (1981). He followed that with The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper (1981), in which he played the legendary plane hijacker who successfully eluded capture (by Robert Duvall); Flashpoint (1984), in which he and Kris Kristofferson starred as a pair of maverick border patrolmen who come upon a large cache of stolen money; Sergio Leone's Il était une fois en Amérique (1984), in which he played a Jimmy Hoffa-like labor organizer; and Smooth Talk (1985), a screen adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates' short story, \"Where Are You Going?\" Television viewers have seen Williams in a prestigious pair of dramas, Dempsey (1983), a three-hour story of the hard-living heavyweight champ, and John Erman's adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" which pitted Williams' Stanley Kowalski against Ann-Margret's Blanche Dubois. Williams has also returned to Broadway sporadically -- first to appear in \"Once in a Lifetime\" while filming \"Hair,\" and in 1981 to play the role of the pirate king in \"The Pirates of Penzance.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MzcwOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3NTA3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001852","name":"Treat Williams","idIMDB":"nm0001852"},"actorId":"nm0001852","character":"Gabe Jacobs","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ronny Cox","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001074","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjAzNTI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA1MjcyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 July 1938","placeOfBirth":" Cloudcroft, New Mexico, USA","birthName":"Daniel Ronald Cox","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Ronny Cox is a superbly talented actor, singer-songwriter and musician who has been consistently active in Hollywood for over 40 years portraying a diverse range of characters. Born in Cloudcroft, New Mexico, Cox received positive reviews in his first film role for his portrayal of ill-fated businessman Drew Ballinger in the terrifying backwoods thriller Deliverance (1972) with Cox featuring in the entertaining \"Duelling Banjos\" sequence of the film. Following this promising start, Cox was regularly guest-starring in numerous television series, before scoring the lead in the short-lived family drama Apple's Way (1974) and grabbing the critics attention again with an excellent performance in the Emmy nominated telemovie A Case of Rape (1974). Interestingly, Cox was often at his best playing rigorous authority figures usually in law enforcement or military roles including as a detective in the telemovie Who Is the Black Dahlia? (1975), alongside Charlton Heston in the submarine drama Gray Lady Down (1978), an Los Angeles detective pursuing cop killers in The Onion Field (1979), and alongside then-rising stars Tom Cruise and Sean Penn in the powerful Taps (1981). The 1980s was a high profile decade for Cox with strong supporting roles in several blockbusters playing strong-willed figures on both sides of the law. Cox starred alongside box office sensation Eddie Murphy in the mega-hit Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and its sequel Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), as well as portraying sinister company executives in the futuristic sci-fi action films RoboCop (1987) and Total Recall (1990). Throughout the 1990s, Cox was again prolific, appearing in many television series, feature films and high-caliber telemovies - He took control of the USS Enterprise for two episodes as Captain Edward Jellico in Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), and Cox contributed entertaining performances in Murder at 1600 (1997), Early Edition (1996), Forces of Nature (1999) and the chilling tale Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: JonBenét and the City of Boulder (2000). Cox has continued to remain busy with more recent performances in Stargate SG-1 (1997), Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) and the highly popular Desperate Housewives (2004). However, when he's not in front of the cameras, Cox can be found touring and demonstrating his musical talents at various music festivals and theatre shows and, to-date, he has released five CDs - an eclectic mixture of jazz, folk and western tunes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjAzNTI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA1MjcyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001074","name":"Ronny Cox","idIMDB":"nm0001074"},"actorId":"nm0001074","character":"Justin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jillian Rose Reed","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2882358","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5ODgzNTc1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc5NzI1ODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 December 1991","placeOfBirth":" Hollywood, Florida, USA","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Jillian Rose Reed was born on December 20, 1991 in Hollywood, Florida, USA.
