To get his career back on track, Yoon tries to grab an exclusive live broadcast. The terrorist demands a hefty sum in exchange and the exclusive gets aired. The terrorist reveals he is one of the construction workers of Mapo Bridge and demands the President's apology for his coworkers who died on the job. However, the government dismisses the demands, and the terrorist strikes again. While efforts to convince both the government and the terrorist go awry, Yoon realizes there is a bomb rigged on him and falls in sheer terror.","simplePlot":"Young-Hwa Yoon, once a top national news anchor wants to get his title back through an exclusive live broadcast with a terrorist.","actors":[{"actorName":"Duk-moon Choi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1117728","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1970","placeOfBirth":" South Korea","bio":"Duk-moon Choi was born in 1970 in South Korea.
