Alexander worked on many films about Ninjas, such as Wu Tang vs. Ninja (1987), The Super Ninja (1986), Shaolin vs. Ninja (1983), Ninja Condors (1987), and Mafia vs. Ninja (1985). He also worked on Shaolin films such as Shaolin Chastity Kung Fu (1981) and the famous Shaolin vs. Lama (1983). In 1984, Tai directed Lou in a nine-hour epic titled Ninja: The Final Duel (1986), and some time after this epic film, Alexander quit acting but did not stop making movies. He continued a long partnership with Robert Tai, only this time as an action choreographer, working on such films as Fist of Legends 2: Iron Bodyguards (1996). He often collaborated with his good friend, the African-American kick-boxer Eugene Thomas (Trammell), where they either fought together as a black/Asian duo, or faced up against each other as arch enemies.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0521585","name":"Alexander Rei Lo","idIMDB":"nm0521585"},"actorId":"nm0521585","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Tai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0846720","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Robert Tai is known for his work on Shaolin Dolemite (1999), Fist of Legends 2: Iron Bodyguards (1996) and Death List (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0846720","name":"Robert Tai","idIMDB":"nm0846720"},"actorId":"nm0846720","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryong Wang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1328425","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ryong Wang is known for his work on Yongho sanggwon (1985), A Strange Story (1983) and Affair of the Gold Bars (1966).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1328425","name":"Ryong Wang","idIMDB":"nm1328425"},"actorId":"nm1328425","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yung Yeh","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3083644","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Yung Yeh is known for his work on Legend of the Drunken Tiger (1990), Shaolin Chastity Kung Fu (1981) and Shaolin vs. Ninja (1983).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3083644","name":"Yung Yeh","idIMDB":"nm3083644"},"actorId":"nm3083644","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0199853","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199853","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":null,"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"5.8","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"59","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0318094","name":"Worldwide Film Productions"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 02:01:40"}}
