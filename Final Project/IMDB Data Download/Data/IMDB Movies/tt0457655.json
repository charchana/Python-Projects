With growing pressure on the facilities, which is on the verge bankruptcy, the orphanage receives an offer of funding from wealthy Danish citizen, Jorgen, which may put an end to its problems. In order to obtain the money, Jacob must travel to Copenhagen, meet with Jorgen, get financial assistance, and be back to celebrate Pramod's 8th birthday. He sets forth, is received by Christian Refner, an employee and future son-in-law of Jorgen. Jacob is shown all possible courtesy and even housed in a posh apartment. He subsequently meets with Jorgen, shows him video-tapes and submits that a few Kroner could really save several lives which would otherwise succumb to minor illnesses and infections....","simplePlot":"A manager of an orphanage in India is sent to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he discovers a life-altering family secret.","actors":[{"actorName":"Mads Mikkelsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0586568","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMTU5MzgxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDI0NjI1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" Østerbro, Copenhagen, Denmark","birthName":"Mads Dittman Mikkelsen","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Mads Mikkelsen is a synonym to the great success the Danish film industry has had since the mid-1990s.
