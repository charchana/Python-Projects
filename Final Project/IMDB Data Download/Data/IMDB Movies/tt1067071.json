With an artist father as a role model Matthew Montgomery was immersed in the art world at a very young age. As his surroundings consisted of his father's gallery as well as his father's friends who were made up of other artists, filmmakers, writers and actors, inspiration was not hard to come by. As a child he was known to put on elaborate puppet shows as well as skits and in depth reenactments of movies and cartoons. With a step-mother who possessed a fascination with classic Hollywood films, Hepburn, Brando, Stewart, and Gable were household fixtures to his upbringing. It wasn't until age eleven that Matthew got his first taste of being center stage in a 6th grade production of E. B. White's \"Charlotte's Web\" which sparked his interest in theatre. This led to a high school rendition in which Matthew went from side character to lead in Irving Berlin's \"Annie Get Your Gun\" as Frank Butler. Fueled by the thrill of the spotlight Matthew went on to study theater at the University of Southern California under the guidance of Eve Roberts, Sharon M. Carnicke, and Mary-Joan Negro. Within his first year he was nicknamed \"The Wonder Freshman,\" as he was able to gain leading or supporting roles in nearly every theatre production that went on throughout the course of his studies. He was also able to gain a leading role in the main-stage production of Landford Wilson's \"The Rimers of Eldritch,\" which at the time was unheard of as freshmen were not allowed in main-stage productions at USC. From there he went on to study at Point Park Conservatory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where during his stay there obtained a role as Johnny Eck in the zombie short \"Reign of the Dead,\" which followed the George Romero zombie saga. With Hollywood being the center of the film industry, Matthew set off to California. Beginning with his first feature film role as Mark Reeves in the Festival Favorite \"Gone, But Not Forgotten,\" which played in over thirty film festivals around the world and was \"Top Ten Best Seller\" for TLA Video for 2003 and 2004, Matthew began his career in Independent Film Cinema with a bang. He went on to star as Marx in Daniel Lee's \"Journeyman,\" a resolute Iraq war veteran who drifts in and out of the main character Anna's life by way of rescue. \"Journeyman\" went on to receive Third Place Feature Film in the Twin Rivers Multimedia Film Festival in Asheville, North Carolina. Following \"Journeyman\" Matthew went on to co-produce and star as Glen Phillips in Rob Williams' gay romantic comedy \"Long-Term Relationship,\" the quirky but rocky tale of Glenn's love for a conservative gay republican southern boy. Real life trials of a relationship are put to the test in this multiple award winning independent film, awards including \"Second Place Best Actor\" and \"Best Feature\" at multiple film festivals. Acquired by here! Films and Regent Releasing, \"Long-Term Relationship\" was released worldwide in November of 2007. Directly after, Matthew again co-produced and starred in Rob Williams' second feature for Guest House Films' \"Back Soon\" as Guillermo 'Gil\" Ramirez, a former drug dealer faced with the reality of his mortality through his own momentary death experience that leads to a bittersweet temporary possession by the spirit of Adrienne Foster, deceased wife of co-lead character Logan Foster. Sparks and attraction emerge, breaching the worlds of the here and now and the great thereafter. This film won the Alternative Spirit Award at the Rhode Island International Film Festival in 2007 and has since been acquired by TLA Releasing and Limelight Pictures for a DVD release scheduled for April 2008. In 2007 alone, Matthew starred in three feature films, produced two, and made a cameo appearance in another. Already slated to star in his next feature in January 2008 as Michael in the psychological thriller, \"Pornography - A Thriller,\" (directed by David Kittredge), Montgomery is also in development of two other features scheduled for a 2008 shoot in conjunction with Guest House Films LLC. In addition, March of 2008 has been scheduled as the worldwide DVD release of \"Socket,\" starring Matthew as Craig Murphy in this gay sci-fi thriller. As well, he will star in David Lewis' latest indie drama titled Redwoods, set to be released in December 2009. Montgomery has allowed the development of a multi-faceted career with the emergence of his production company, Proteus Pictures. It's doors will open with Matthew's first feature, \"Sticke Figures,\" the story of a recovering gay alcoholic from Manhattan who returns home to a small town in Texas after the death of his ex-girlfriend, only to discover that his inheritance is much more than he bargained for, and wears a dress. Matthew Montgomery lives in Hollywood, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4ODA1NjQ3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY2MDIzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1343042","name":"Matthew Montgomery","idIMDB":"nm1343042"},"actorId":"nm1343042","character":"Mortimer Gladstein","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Meredith Barnett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2335707","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMTQ5ODM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc3Nzc0ODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Meredith Barnett is an actress, known for Fear House (2008), The Bet (2016) and Ira.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMTQ5ODM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc3Nzc0ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2335707","name":"Meredith Barnett","idIMDB":"nm2335707"},"actorId":"nm2335707","character":"Eva Tinski","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kiersten Hall","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2323999","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk5NDk5MzY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM1MjgxNzE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Kiersten Sheri Hall","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Kiersten Hall was born in Albuquerque, NM with one older brother.
