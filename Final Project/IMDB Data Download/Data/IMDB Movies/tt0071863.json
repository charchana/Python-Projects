Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"Pierre Durois","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jane Birkin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000945","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MDM3NjczOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ0MDgwNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 December 1946","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Jane Mallory Birkin","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Jane Birkin was born on December 14, 1946 in London, England as Jane Mallory Birkin.

And yet, Guiomar first saw himself as a dentist, ... like Daddy! But he finally proved the saying 'Like father like song' wrong. Too bad for dentistry but so much the better for entertainment which otherwise would have had to do without his singular talent. And, to tell the truth, Julien Guiomar did not coddle himself. He indeed appeared in over thirty plays with Jean Vilar's famed Théâtre National Populaire (TNP); he was in more than forty TV films, in which his incredible presence allowed him to embody such figures as Alexandre Borgia or Diafoirus in Molière's Le malade imaginaire (1971). His film parts are even more numerous and include authority figures (colonels, police commissioners, prelates and even God Himself in Arthur Joffé's curious comedy Let There Be Light (1998). As of his first two appearances, in Philippe de Broca's King of Hearts (1966), as a lunatic who takes himself for a bishop and in Louis Malle's The Thief of Paris (1967) as a phony priest, Julien Guiomar has imposed an image of authority tinged with eccentricity. Always colorful in his expression, he can also exert sheer spitefulness (the colonel in Costa-Gavras Z (1969)) or warm humanity (the surgeon of Serge Korber's Je vous ferai aimer la vie (1979)). He may have been in too many campy comedies but he saves them from total crassness by his mere inspired presence. Julien Guiomar retired in 2004 after a final TV Film.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc3NTYxOTE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE4MzI1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0347453","name":"Julien Guiomar","idIMDB":"nm0347453"},"actorId":"nm0347453","character":"Albert Renaudin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Henri Guybet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0349869","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 December 1936","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","bio":"Henri Guybet was born on December 21, 1936 in Paris, France.
