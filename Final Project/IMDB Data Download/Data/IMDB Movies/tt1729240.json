Stock, RE, and his wife Margaret Marion Munro. In British India from childhood, he and his sister Angela returned to the UK in his early teens for schooling. Nigel was educated at St. Paul's School and studied for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he earned the Leverhulme Exhibition, Northcliffe Scholarship, and the Principal's Medal. He made his debut stage appearance at the Savoy Theatre in 1931, at the age of 12, in a production of \"The Traveller in the Dark\". He continued to rack up a number of classical and contemporary credits at various distinguished theaters, including the Old Vic, with productions of \"The Winter's Tale\", \"Macbeth\" (playing Macduff), \"Tobacco Road\" and \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\". Stock interrupted his thriving career by serving in the Army from 1939 to 1941 with the London Irish Rifles, and with the Assam Regiment, Indian Army between 1941 and 1945 in Burma, China and Kohima. He was honorably discharged with the rank of Major. He returned to the stage in 1946 with \"And No Birds Sing\" and made his first appearance on the New York stage as \"Philip\" in \"You Never Can Tell\" in 1948. A reliable player who lent distinction to every aspect of the theatrical repertoire, from William Shakespeare through Anton Chekhov to modern farce, he impressed in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial\", \"Altona\", \"Uncle Vanya\" and \"Sleuth\", among others.

In press materials in the 1940s he claimed that his father was a farmer and later a stockbroker; it turns out that he had actually been born out of wedlock, as his biography \"Who's There?\" states. At age 16 he was adopted by Hugh Blaker, a well-known art connoisseur, who helped him to get a job with Sir Frank Benson's Shakespearean Company. He started as a general dogsbody--call-boy, assistant stage manager, property master and assistant lighting director--but was occasionally allowed to play small walk-on parts. Two years later he left Benson's group and went off on tour, working for a number of different companies about Britain. He became known as an actor of farce and understudied renowned performers such as Lawrence Grossmith, Ernest Truex, Bud Flanagan and Charles Heslop. He played repertory in Richmond, Harrogate, Leeds and Sheffield and had a successful run as the lead in a touring production of \"Charley's Aunt.\" He also toured Canada in 1928-29, acquiring much valuable experience. On his return to England, Hartnell married actress Heather McIntyre. He starred in such films as I'm an Explosive (1933), The Way Ahead (1944), Strawberry Roan (1944), The Agitator (1945), Query (1945) and Appointment with Crime (1946). His memorable performance on the television series The Army Game (1957) and the movie This Sporting Life (1963) led to him being cast as the Doctor on Doctor Who (1963), for which he is best remembered. His son-in-law is agent Terry Carney. His granddaughter is Jessica Carney (real name Judith Carney), who authored a biography of her grandfather, \"Who's There?\", in 1996.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMDAyNzI4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI0NTg2OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0367156","name":"William Hartnell","nicknames":["Billy","Bill"],"idIMDB":"nm0367156"},"actorId":"nm0367156","character":"Insp.
