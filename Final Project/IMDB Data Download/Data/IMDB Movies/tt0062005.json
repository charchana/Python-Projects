Once she finished her formal schooling, Martha played a bit role in 1946's The Locket (1946). Slowly, Martha began picking up roles with more and more substance. The best years for the beautiful actress began in 1954 when she played in films such as Down Three Dark Streets (1954), Showdown at Abilene (1956) and Battle Hymn (1957). Perhaps the best role of her long career was as \"Gwen French\" in 1958's Some Came Running (1958) in which she starred opposite Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine. As a result of her stellar role, Martha received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress, but she lost out to Wendy Hiller in Separate Tables (1958). Afterwards, Martha's stint on the US silver screen's trailed off some. She did make a handful of foreign films, returning to appear in the US from time to time, but nothing compared to the pace she had in the fifties. Her last film was in 1973 in the film The Day of the Wolves (1971). In 1966, she married producer Hal B. Wallis and remained with him until his death in 1986.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1ODE4MDk4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYyNzQyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0405054","name":"Martha Hyer","nicknames":["Martha Lou Spring"],"idIMDB":"nm0405054"},"actorId":"nm0405054","character":"Ana María","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Analía Gadé","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0300623","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3OGI4MzYtM2M0MC00NDMwLTlmNjUtOWU5N2RhNjRhYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0ODkwMTU@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 October 1931","placeOfBirth":" Córdoba, Argentina","birthName":"María Esther Gorostiza Rodríguez","bio":"Argentinian actress.
