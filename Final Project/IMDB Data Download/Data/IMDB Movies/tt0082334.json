Her father, born in Manhattan, was from a Jewish family (from Hungary and Russia), and her mother, originally from Arkansas, had English and Scots-Irish ancestry. Hershey was raised in a small bungalow, and had aspirations of being an actress from her earliest memories. The multi-award-winning actress has been in some of Hollywood's most memorable films. She has been a winner of an Emmy and a Golden Globe for A Killing in a Small Town (1990). She won two consecutive Best Actress awards at the Cannes Film Festival, (which is unprecedented) for Shy People (1987) and A World Apart (1988). She won a Gemini Award for Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning (2008) for PBS and a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Vienna International Film Festival. Hershey was nominated for an Academy Award for The Portrait of a Lady (1996). She's worked with some of the world's great directors, among them - Martin Scorsese, William Wyler, Woody Allen, Jane Campion and Darren Aronofsky. The versatile actress was first discovered by a talent agent while she was attending Hollywood High School. She began working in television, The Monroes (1966), and film, With Six You Get Eggroll (1968), with Doris Day. And with roles in The Baby Maker (1970) and Boxcar Bertha (1972), Hershey quickly advanced to starring roles. The 1980's catapulted Hershey's film career, when she starred in The Stunt Man (1980) with 'Peter O'Toole', The Right Stuff (1983), The Natural (1984) with Robert Redford, Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) with Woody Allen, Hoosiers (1986) with Gene Hackman, Tin Men (1987), Shy People (1987), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), A World Apart (1988) and Beaches (1988) with Bette Midler. Hershey returned to television in 1990 with her highly-lauded performance in A Killing in a Small Town (1990), Paris Trout (1991), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), the British mini-series, Daniel Deronda (2002) and the last season of Chicago Hope (1994). During the same period, Hershey remained active in features. She was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe for The Portrait of a Lady (1996). She also starred in Merchant-Ivory's La fille d'un soldat ne pleure jamais (1998) and the award-winning Australian film, Lantana (2001). Recently, Hershey has recently performed in James Wan's cult-hit, Insidious (2010) and Darren Aronofsky's award-winning Black Swan (2010), playing Natalie Portman's insane mother. Hershey resides in Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNzQ1NjU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYzMTkwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001347","name":"Barbara Hershey","idIMDB":"nm0001347"},"actorId":"nm0001347","character":"Carla Moran","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027887","main":true},{"actorName":"Ron Silver","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0798779","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2ODUxOTI2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTIyNTA2._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 July 1946","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Ronald Arthur Silver","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Ron Silver was born on July 2, 1946 in New York City, New York, USA as Ronald Arthur Silver.

So far, in 2006, Allan has been featured in \"My Sexiest Year,\" opposite Frances Fisher and Frankie Muniz, and been interviewed for the documentary \"Troupers.\" Last year he appeared in three soon to be released features. \"Rise\" with Lucy Liu and Michael Chiklis, \"Lies & Alibis\" with Steve Coogan and Rebecca Romijn, and \"The Man in the Chair,\" with Christopher Plummer. Recent Independent features include \"The Burial Society\" with David Paymer, \"The Dog Walker,\" and \"Intoxicating\" with John Savage. Other feature film credits include Steven Speilberg's \"Amistad,\" \"Disclosure\" (as Demi Moore's attorney), and Robert Redford's \"Quiz Show.\" Critic Gary Franklin hailed his performance as Robert Kintner, President of NBC, `one of the Top Five of the Year.' Additional notable performances include the role of Dr. Belfonte, opposite Robin Williams in \"Jack,\" and Bill Adolphe (Halle Berry's lawyer) in \"A Rich Man's Wife.\" Recent television credits include \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" as a holocaust `Survivor,' \"Living With Fran,\" \"NYPD Blue,\" \"Judging Amy,\" \"CSI,\" and \"The Division.\" Allan began his distinguished acting career as a teenager in New York, working with immortals such as Edward G. Robinson, Claude Raines, Ralph Bellamy, Jack Palance, Kim Hunter, Milton Berle, and Henry Fonda. He was enjoying the fruits of his labor until, without warning, his dreams were shattered when the McCarthy Era fell upon the nation and Allan was caught up in the `Red Scare' and blacklisted. With no income, a family to support and with little training outside of the acting profession, Rich cajoled his way onto Wall Street. After five years of buying and selling, he decided to open his own brokerage firm and with fervor, began to collect fine art. With the same drive and determination to master yet another field of endeavor, he soon became an expert in modern art, opening Allan Rich Galleries on Madison Avenue, where he began selling major paintings to important collectors and publishing lithographs of Miro, Calder, and Salvador Dali. His experience with Dali, in 1970, led him to co-write a screenplay \"Memories of Surrealism.\" Despite his enormous success outside of the entertainment field, Rich, separated from his professional passion, returned to the stage in Ron Ribman's \"Journey of the Fifth Horse,\" with a young Dustin Hoffman. He re-launched his film career in 1973 playing the D.A. in \"Serpico\" with Al Pacino. One of his main scenes was shown on the Academy Awards. Rich took out ads in the trades and received one call from John Crosby at ICM, who helped reestablished his reputation and went on to appear in more than 75 television shows, MOWs and 68 features that also include \"Frances, \"Eating Raoul,\" and \"Guilty By Suspicion.\" After years of teaching, Allan has developed his own acting technique, his book A Leap From the Method will be published this fall by Author House. Some of his more famous students include Sharon Stone, Jamie Lee Curtis, Rene Russo, Donna Dixon, Jack Scalia, Alan Thicke and Larry Miller. In addition, in 1994, Rich co-founded We Care About Kids, a non-profit organization that produces live action educational short films for middle and high school youths on socially relevant topics and has received praise for its efforts from President Clinton, Senator Diane Feinstein, former Speaker of the House, Richard Gephardt, former Governor Gray Davis and poet Maya Angelou. The organization is currently raising money for a new film on child abuse entitled \"In the Room.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3OTY5Mjg5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyOTAzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723590","name":"Allan Rich","idIMDB":"nm0723590"},"actorId":"nm0723590","character":"Dr. Walcott","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0183636","main":true},{"actorName":"Natasha Ryan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0752757","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 May 1970","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","bio":"Natasha Ryan got her start in commercials at the age of 2 until the age of 5, when she was selected to play the role of Hope Alice Williams on Days of Our Lives (1965).

In Hollywood from 1963, he worked as a bartender during the lean years and began his TV career in the late 60s. Slowly, he came to show sly, lethal menace in \"big city\" films and, in the next decade, notably played Las Vegas syndicate boss Moe Green who gets a bullet in the eye during the violent \"christening sequence\" of Mario Puzo's Oscar-winning The Godfather (1972). Finding a comfortable niche playing various swarthy-looking cronies, hoods and cops, he made a distinct impression when he switched to TV comedy and, in the late 80s, won an Emmy for The Famous Teddy Z (1989) during the 1989-1990 season. Other comedy series such as Sibs (1991) and The George Carlin Show (1994) came and went with over 400 TV appearances racked up so far. Recurring roles on The Simpsons (1989) and The Facts of Life (1979) (as Nancy McKeon's father) has kept him alive, as well. Rocco has appeared in two films helmed by his son, screenwriter and director Marc Rocco: Scenes from the Goldmine (1987) and Dream a Little Dream (1989). Other memorably flashy film roles include The Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973), Freebie and the Bean (1974), The Stunt Man (1980), Lady in White (1988), Get Shorty (1995) and Just Write (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MTMyNTkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA4NTAzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0733678","name":"Alex Rocco","nicknames":["Bobo"],"idIMDB":"nm0733678"},"actorId":"nm0733678","character":"Jerry Anderson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0183639","main":true},{"actorName":"Sully Boyar","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101604","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 December 1923","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Israel Sully Boyarsky","bio":"Sully Boyar was born on December 14, 1923 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA as Israel Sully Boyarsky.
