Getting her start at the tender age of 12, Nicole moved from her upstate New York hometown to Manhattan on a scholarship to the School of American Ballet. Introduced to Warhol associate Paul Morrissey through her manager, she was cast in his classic film \"News From Nowhere,\" giving Nicole her first Venice Film Festival experience. Another introduction, this time to notable director Gregg Araki, lead to a role in the widely acclaimed \"Kaboom,\" leading her to both Cannes and cult status. Extensive television and film credits followed including turns in 'Nurse Jackie,' 'Rescue Me,' ' Law & Order: Criminal Intent,' 'The Mentalist,' 'CSI,' \"Zoolander,\" \"Dinner For Schmucks,\" \"Shouting Secrets\" and \"Nous York.\" Nicole's career gained steam with the high-profile role of hipster vixen Lulu on the HBO Original Series 'How to Make It in America' and she was most recently featured on Showtime's smash hit 'Dexter' as the mysterious Arlene Shram. She will next appear in the film \"Girls Against Boys,\" out in February. In it she portrays serial killer Lu. Lu who, alongside naïve college student Shae, helps plot revenge on the men that have abused them. The controversial thriller made the festival circuit rounds, playing the South by Southwest Film Festival and Sitges. Picked up by Anchor Bay Films, it was one of the first distribution deals at SXSW and has been cited as being both \"provocative\" and \"stylish.\" Nicole has a long love of fashion and has been shot by such acclaimed photographers as David LaChapelle, Ellen von Unwerth, Terry Richardson and Patrick Demarchelier to name a few, and has been featured in publications ranging from Vogue to Interview. Just last year she was photographed by Drew Barrymore for a V Magazine portfolio. Modeling since her teens, she has appeared in campaigns for Coach, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Ready to Wear designer Christian Siriano. She also possesses a flair for music. Signed to the label Chrysalis as a teenager, she turned her focus to other artistic pursuits before returning to her passion. She is presently recording in Los Angeles, where she currently resides.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTgwNDQ1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU1MTEzMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2674140","name":"Nicole LaLiberte","idIMDB":"nm2674140"},"actorId":"nm2674140","character":"Lulu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0365716","main":true},{"actorName":"Danielle Panabaker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1263939","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNzc1NDA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzExMzQzMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1987","placeOfBirth":" Augusta, Georgia, USA","birthName":"Danielle Nicole Panabaker","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Danielle Nicole Panabaker was born in Augusta, Georgia.
