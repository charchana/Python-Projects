A graduate of the world famous Sylvia Young Theatre School, Silva is best known for her long running role as Kelly Windsor in top-rated British television drama Emmerdale (1972), for which the Daily Express described her as \"soap's sexiest star.\" Silva made her screen acting debut opposite Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred in a scene from Doctor Who: Survival: Part Three (1989), which also has its place in history as the last transmitted episode of the original series of Doctor Who (1963). She followed this with guest appearances in popular British television shows such as The Bill (1984), EastEnders (1985) and Mr. Majeika (1988). Adele then joined the cast of Emmerdale (1972) and was at the centre of dozens of dramatic storylines, working with the likes of Patsy Kensit, Patrick Mower and Linda Thorson. During a break from the show she guested in episodes of The Courtroom (2004) and Mile High (2003). She also spent a year of further acting training at the world-renowned Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Shortly after quitting Emmerdale (1972) in 2007, Silva took part - and came second in - hit reality show Hell's Kitchen (2005) with fiery chef Marco Pierre White. The same year she starred opposite Spandau Ballet legend Gary Kemp in the short film Karma Magnet (2008), directed by his brother, Martin Kemp.

He attended St. Columba's High School in Gourock, Inverclyde, where he passed through his Standard Grade Exams and obtained three As and two Bs in his Higher results. He left school after his fifth year to pursue his dream as a footballer and was soon signed by Morton Football Team. In 2000, director Ken Loach discovered him at an audition at his old high school and gave him the lead role in Sweet Sixteen (2002). The movie was filmed in Martin's home area, including Greenock, Gourock, Inverkip, Kilmalcolm, and Wemyss Bay. The film was a huge success, which shot Martin into full view of the public and even gave some fame to Inverclyde. However, many counselors thought that this was bad publicity because the film has to do with drugs and underage drinking. However, Ken Loach then made a statement that the movie was not based on Greenock and Inverclyde - but was only filmed there, as that was where Martin was located.

Berkoff was born in Stepney, London in August 1937 and received dramatic arts training in both Paris and London and then moved on to performing with several repertory companies, before he formed the London Theatre Group in 1968. Berkoff had actually been appearing in uncredited roles in UK cinema since 1959, and started to get noticed by casting agents with his performances in Hamlet at Elsinore (1964), Nicholas and Alexandra (1971), A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Barry Lyndon (1975). Mainstream film fans are probably most familiar with Steven Berkoff via his portrayal of a trio of ice cold villains in several big budget Hollywood productions of the 1980s. Firstly, he played a rogue general plotting to launch a war in Europe in Octopussy (1983), then a drug smuggling art dealer out to kill Detroit narcotics officer Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop (1984), and thirdly as a sadistic Russian commando officer torturing Sylvester Stallone in Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). Berkoff continued to contribute scintillating performances and was quite memorable as Adolf Hitler in War and Remembrance (1988), The Krays (1990) and the haunting The Tell-Tale Heart (1991). Further villainous roles followed for the steely Berkoff in Fair Game (1995) and the Jean-Claude Van Damme kick flick Legionnaire (1998). He excelled in the camp comedy 9 Dead Gay Guys (2002), played UK crime figure Charlie Richardson Snr. in Charlie (2004) and then appeared in the passionate Greek film about mail order brides simply titled, Les mariées (2004) (\"Brides\"). His screen performances are but one part of the brilliance of Steven Berkoff, as he has additionally built a formidable reputation for his superb craftsmanship in the theatre. Berkoff has written and performed original plays including \"Decadence\", \"Harry's Christmas Lunch\" \"Brighton Beach Scumbags\" and \"Sink the Belgrano\", as well as appearing in productions of \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Coriolanus\" to rapturous audiences right across the globe.
