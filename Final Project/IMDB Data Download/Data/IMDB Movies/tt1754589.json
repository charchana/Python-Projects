He went on to appear in such TV shows as \"Nip/Tuck\", \"Next\", \"Smallville\" and he also played actress Katie Holmes' boyfriend in \"Dawson's Creek.\" He can also be seen in the role of Zach in the soon-to-be-released indie feature \"Lost Dream\" along side actors Patricia Richardson and Jeremy London as well as in a supporting role in the indie feature \"Under The Gaydar.\" The role of Tony in \"Redefining Normal\" is the first starring film role for Anthony.
