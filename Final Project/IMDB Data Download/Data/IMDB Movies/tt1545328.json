He describes this role as the one which dramatically altered his career. Critical raves for his role in Gods and Monsters (1998) pointed to yet another dimension to his dramatic persona.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MjExMzY0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMxOTg4MTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000409","name":"Brendan Fraser","idIMDB":"nm0000409"},"actorId":"nm0000409","character":"Joe Maguire","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Colm Meaney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000538","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDMzMTQ4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMyNjQ0Mw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 May 1953","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Colm Meaney was born on May 30, 1953 in Dublin, Ireland.
