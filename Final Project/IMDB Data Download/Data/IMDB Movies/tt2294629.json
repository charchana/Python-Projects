She was born and raised in Huntington Woods, Michigan, and is the daughter of Lorelei (Frygier), a nurse, and Tom Bell, a television news director. Her ancestry is Polish (mother) and German, English, Irish, and Scottish (father). Kristen found her talent in entertainment at an early age. In 1992, she went to her first audition and won a role in Raggedy Ann and Andy. Bell's mother established her with an agent before she was 13, and she was cast in newspaper advertisements and television commercials. At this time, she also began private acting lessons. Bell had an uncredited role in the film Polish Wedding (1998) in 1998. Bell attended Shrine Catholic High School, where she took part in drama and music club. She won the starring role of Dorothy in her high school's production of The Wizard of Oz. After graduation Bell moved to New York City to attend prestigious Tisch School of the Arts, where she studied musical theater. In 2001, Bell left university to play the role of Becky in Tom Sawyer. That same year, she made her first credited debut in Pootie Tang (2001), but her scene was cut and her appearance exists only in the credit sequence. In 2002, Bell appeared in the Broadway revival of The Crucible with Liam Neeson and Angela Bettis. She then moved to Los Angeles, California, and appeared in a handful television shows as a special guest, finding trouble gaining a recurring role in a television series. In 2004, Bell appeared in the Lifetime's television film, Gracie's Choice, which received high ratings. At the age 24, Bell won the title role in Veronica Mars (2004), which started broadcasting in the fall of 2004, created by Rob Thomas. Bell starred as a seventeen-year-old detective, which put her alongside actors Enrico Colantoni who played her father, Percy Daggs III, Jason Dohring and Ryan Hansen. This series received very positive reviews, and Bell received much attention for her performance. Bell and the cast of Veronica Mars were nominated for two Teen Choice Awards. In 2005, Bell starred in Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005) in the role of Mary Lane. Reefer Madness debuted on the Showtime network on April 16, 2005. The following year, Bell won the Saturn Award for 'Best Actress on Television' for her performance in Veronica Mars. In 2013, Bell voiced the main character, Princess Anna of Arendelle, in the Walt Disney Pictures animated movie, Frozen (2013), which received the 'best animated feature' award at the 86th Academy Awards. She performed the songs: 'For the First Time in Forever', 'Love is an Open Door', 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman', and 'For the First Time in Forever (Reprise)'. Frozen (2013), which was released on November 22, 2013, was hugely successful worldwide. On March 13, 2013, it was confirmed that a Veronica Mars (2014) movie would finally be coming to fruition. Bell and creator, Rob Thomas, launched a fund raising campaign to produce the film through Kickstarter and attained the $2 million goal in few hours. The movie was released on March 14, 2014. Bell married Dax Shepard in October, 2013.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MjkzOTIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM3MTkzMTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068338","name":"Kristen Bell","nicknames":["K-Bell","Annie","KB","Bellie"],"idIMDB":"nm0068338"},"actorId":"nm0068338","character":"Anna","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0307445","main":true},{"actorName":"Idina Menzel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0579953","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTUyMzM4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzMwOTI4._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 May 1971","placeOfBirth":" Syosset, New York, USA","birthName":"Idina Kim Mentzel","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Idina Menzel was born on May 30, 1971 in Syosset, New York, USA as Idina Kim Mentzel.

During this time, Alan was also an active member of the Delta Psi Omega fraternity. After leaving LMJC, Alan went on to study at the prestigious Juilliard conservatory but left in 1996 before earning a degree. After a number of smaller stage productions and a small role in the movie Patch Adams (1998), Alan landed his first Broadway role in 1999 with \"Epic Proportions.\" He quickly became a sought-after comedic actor, with roles in such films as 28 Days (2000) and A Knight's Tale (2001). In 2002, Alan got the role of Wash, the wise-cracking pilot of Serenity on the short-lived series Firefly (2002). Although it lasted only eleven episodes, this may be Alan's most well-known and best-loved role. No other networks would buy the failed series, but Universal Pictures began courting creator Joss Whedon to produce a big-screen version of the series. While awaiting the final news of Firefly's fate, Alan played the beloved Steve the Pirate in the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) and the voice of the robot Sonny in I, Robot (2004). In 2005, Alan finally reprised the role of Wash in Serenity (2005), the feature-film version of the series Firefly.

He was one of five children and the only son. His father was a doctor who hoped to have Ciaran follow in his footsteps, but that was not to be. It was his mother Moya, an amateur actress, who was the real influence behind his decision to become an actor. Though he did enroll in Law at Queens' University of Belfast, he left that in order to train in acting at RADA. He began his stage career at the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre as a pantomime horse in the production of \"Cinderella\". Staying with the company for several years, he starred in a number of productions, including playing the lead roles in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" and \"Faust\". His stage career has included working with The Field Day Company and a number of world tours. He has starred in a number of productions with the Royal Shakespeare Company, including a world tour in the title role of \"Richard III\". Hinds' film career began in 1981 in the movie Excalibur (1981), which boasted a cast rich in talented actors including Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne and Patrick Stewart. In-between his movie work, he's amassed a large number of television credits. Playing such classic characters as \"Mr. Rochester\" in Jane Eyre (1997), and \"Captain Wentworth\" in Screen Two: Persuasion (1995) has increased his popularity and most definitely given him much increased recognition. As for his personal life, you won't be likely to see his name in the weekly tabloids. He likes to keep his private life private. It is known that he is in a long-term, committed relationship with a French-Vietnamese actress named Hélène Patarot and they have a daughter together and live in Paris. He is in very high demand and his reputation as a quality, professional actor is sure to keep him busy for as long as he chooses.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyNjM0MzU0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIxMzg1MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001354","name":"Ciarán Hinds","idIMDB":"nm0001354"},"actorId":"nm0001354","character":"Pabbie / Grandpa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0441390","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0930261","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMDM4NzM3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYwNzkyMg@@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Chris Williams is known for his work on Moana (2016), Bolt (2008) and Mulan (1998).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMDM4NzM3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYwNzkyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0930261","name":"Chris Williams","idIMDB":"nm0930261"},"actorId":"nm0930261","character":"Oaken","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0458902","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephen J.

She retired when the dance teacher was arrested on a morals charge for \"dating\" the tall and lissome, yet underage, star dancer in the troupe. That girl's big number culminated with a back-bend where Edie drank a soda upside down (of course). Edie has a Master of Science from Syracuse and taught radio at the University of Missouri/Kansas City for eight years. There she re-entered the entertainment field as a DJ, newswoman and producer for the NPR affiliate KCUR-FM. Her proudest moment was portraying John Ehrlichman in Conversation 26 of the NPR national broadcast of the Nixon Tape Transcripts. Thus did Edie contribute to the peaceful overthrow of the government of an unindicted co-conspirator. Her career-long devotion to satirical improvisation included an impressive tenure with The Groundlings. She went on to create original characters, performed on the daytime The David Letterman Show (1980): Mrs. Marv Mendenhall, Dot Duncan, Whirly June Pickens, Officer Jeanelle Archer, 105-year-old Edie, etc. TV has been a home to many of Edie's characters--on The Richard Pryor Show (1977); as Lucille Tarlek, wife of mega-obnoxious ad salesman Herb Tarlek on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978); and as Mrs. Poole on Valerie (1986). Her movie career growth paralleled her ten years with The Groundlings. Her first film was the teen horror favorite Carrie (1976). She did several John Hughes films, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), She's Having a Baby (1988) and _Curly Sue (1990)_. Offbeat cult faves are Eating Raoul (1982), Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988), HBO's The Pee Wee Herman Show (1981) and Martin Mull's The History of White People in America (1985). In more mainstream films, she received a National Media Award for her portrayal of a mentally disabled woman in Bill: On His Own (1983), starring Mickey Rooney. She's acted for Robert Redford in A River Runs Through It (1992), for Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers (1994), for Diane Keaton in Raccroche! (2000) and she was named Best Actress of the Chicago Alternative Film Festival for her portrayal of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski's mother. A few of Edie's most recent accomplishments: Fat Actress (2005)' Rude Lady in Restroom, David Spade's nasty neighbor in Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003), Dana Carvey's mother in Sony Pictures' The Master of Disguise (2002), Jane Kaczmarek's friend in Malcolm in the Middle (2000), guest-starring on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), NBC's Providence (1999), WB's 7th Heaven (1996), Lea Thompson's mother on Caroline in the City (1995) and several animation roles for TV and in features, such as The Little Mermaid (1989), The Rugrats Movie (1998) and as Dr. Flora in A Bug's Life (1998).
