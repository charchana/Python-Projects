He is the son of Judith J. (Meek), a writer and editor, and Wayne M. Spade, a sales rep, and is of German, English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Raised in both Scottsdale (from age four) and Casa Grande, Arizona, he graduated with a degree in business from Arizona State University in 1986. A natural prankster most of his life, Spade was pushed immediately into stand-up comedy by friends and appeared in nightclubs and college campuses all over the country. A casting agent saw his routine at \"The Improv\" in Los Angeles and offered him a mischievous role in the film Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987). In 1990, the diminutive, flaxen-haired comedian finally hit the big time as a regular cast member and writer on Saturday Night Live (1975). Slow at first in gaining acceptance on the show, his razor-sharp sarcasm eventually caught on by his second season, when he played a number of smart-aleck characters in a variety of sketches, including a highly disinterested airline steward who bids each passenger adieu with a very sardonic \"buh-bye\" and an irritating receptionist for Dick Clark Productions who greets each huge celebrity with an unknowing \"And you are . . . ?\" A master of the putdown, Spade's \"Hollywood Minute\" reporter also took cynical advantage of tabloid-worthy stars. Spade impersonated such luminaries as Michael J. Fox, Kurt Cobain and Tom Petty during his tenure. Following his SNL departure after six years, he spun off into a slapstick movie career, most noticeably as the scrawny, taciturn foil to SNL's wild and crazy big boy Chris Farley in Tommy Boy (1995) and Black Sheep (1996). The teaming of this unlikely but funny pair ended with Farley's death from a 1997 drug overdose. Since then, Spade has appeared in his own lukewarm vehicles, including Joe Dirt (2001) and Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003). More recently he teamed with former SNL member Rob Schneider on the film The Benchwarmers (2006). Television has been more accepting over the years, with Spade earning an Emmy nomination as the droll, skirt-chasing secretary Dennis Finch on Just Shoot Me! (1997) and filling in after the untimely death of John Ritter on ABC's 8 Simple Rules (2002) as Katey Sagal's unprincipled nephew. More recently he was the star of the Comedy Central show The Showbiz Show with David Spade (2005) in 2005 wherein he more or less resurrected his obnoxious, razor-tongued gossipmonger from the old \"Hollywood Minute\" put-down segment on SNL, as well as co-starring in the adult-oriented ensemble sitcom Rules of Engagement (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3OTQxMzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA0NjA0OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005450","name":"David Spade","idIMDB":"nm0005450"},"actorId":"nm0005450","character":"Kuzco / Kuzco Llama","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013420","main":true},{"actorName":"John Goodman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000422","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MTIzODQ1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI4Mzc1OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 June 1952","placeOfBirth":" St. Louis, Missouri, USA","birthName":"John Stephen Goodman","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"John Stephen Goodman is a U.S. film, television, and stage actor.

Warburton starred for 7 seasons on the hit CBS comedy \"Rules of Engagement\" with David Spade, Oliver Hudson, and Megyn Price about two couples and their single friend, all at different stages in their relationships dealing with the complications of dating, commitment, and marriage. He is now set to star in NBC's newest sitcom series entitled \"Crowded,\" premiering Sunday, March 20th, about an empty nest couple (Warburton & Carrie Preston) who find out their adult daughters want to move back home with them. Patrick also played \"Guy\" in the international blockbuster comedy Ted and recently completed shooting the highly anticipated sequel Ted 2 where he reprises his role. Warburton starred on the ABC hit comedy \"Less than Perfect,\" as \"Jeb Denton,\" an opinionated network anchorman; and on the hit show \"NewsRadio\" as \"Johnny Johnson\" the unscrupulous business rival who takes over the station. Warburton starred in Disney's major motion picture, live action comedy Underdog, as the archenemy \"Cad,\" based on the 1964 cartoon television series. He is also perhaps the busiest voiceover artist in Hollywood for his many characters including the role of the paraplegic and over-zealous cop, \"Joe Swanson,\" on the hit comedy \"Family Guy.\" Warburton was the lead in the independent film The Civilization of Maxwell Bright, in which he stared as a vicious and self-destructive anti-hero who desperately needs to save his soul. The film won numerous festival awards in which Warburton captured Best Actor at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, New York VisionFest, and the Boulder International Film Festival. The film's other honors include Viewer's Choice at the Beverly Hills Film Festival, the Special Jury Award at WorldFest Houston and at the Florida Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Florida Film Festival, and the Vision Award for David Beaird at WorldFest Houston. This festival favorite is essentially a modern re-telling of \"Beauty and the Beast\" that explores what happens when a modern Neanderthal is locked in close proximity with a kind and loving woman. Written and directed by David Beaird, The Civilization of Maxwell Bright co-stars Jennifer Tilly, Marie Matiko, Simon Callow and Eric Roberts. In addition, Warburton starred in the independent feature film I'll Believe You alongside Fred Willard, Thomas Gibson, and Chris Elliott, a comedy for young adults/teens about a hunt for an alleged alien living in a small town after a mysterious phone call is received on a radio broadcast. The film was released in April of 2007 to 1,500 theaters nationwide, quite the accomplishment for a small independent film. To complement his animated films, Warburton voiced the hit cartoon series \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" and the animated feature Bee Movie with Jerry Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Uma Thurman and Oprah Winfrey. He played the character \"Rip Smashenburn\" in the UPN animated series \"Game Over,\" the voice of \"Brock Samson\" in the animated adult series \"The Venture Brothers,\" and the voice of \"Mr. Barkin\" on the Disney Channel's \"Disney's Kim Possible.\" He plays the character of Ian, \"the ultimate alpha-male,\" in the Sony animated film Open Season opposite Ashton Kutcher and Martin Lawrence. Playing in both regular theaters and Imax 3-D, it was a box office smash on its opening week as #1 and held top spots following its debut. Warburton's voice can also be heard alongside that of Sarah Michelle Geller, Sigourney Weaver, George Carlin, Andy Dick, and Freddie Prinze Jr. in the animated feature film Happily N'ever After, from the producers of Shrek, where he plays the voice of \"Prince Humperdink.\" As the voice of the \"Savior of the Universe\" in Disney's animated Saturday morning TV series \"Buzz Lightyear,\" Warburton's voice graced the big screen in the Disney animated film The Emperor's New Groove, Kronks New Groove and \"The Emperor's New School.\" Warburton started his television career appearing regularly on the CBS sitcom \"Dave's World,\" with Harry Anderson and Mesach Taylor and originally guest-starred on \"Seinfeld\" as the painted-faced New Jersey Devils' fan and Jerry's mechanic, only to become one of the show's funniest fixtures. He also did commercial spots for American Express (as the voice of \"Superman\" alongside Seinfeld), Cadillac, and M&Ms. Warburton starred in The Woman Chaser, which received critical acclaim at the prestigious New York Film Festival and The Sundance Film Festival, as well as opposite Sam Neill in The Dish, an Australian production about the first man on the moon. Barry Sonnenfeld directed Warburton in the Columbia Tri Star half-hour comedy \"The Tick,\" which continues to have a huge cult following since its release on DVD. The show gained its popularity with audiences due to its relaxed, adult-friendly comedy. \"The Tick\", in addition to the DVD, has released action figures, t-shirts, and Quaker Oat Life cereal boxes with \"The Tick\" character adorning the cover. He also paired up with Tim Allen in Sonnenfeld's feature films Big Trouble and Joe Somebody, and also appeared in Scream 3 and Men in Black 2. A native Californian, Patrick grew up in Huntington Beach and resides in Los Angeles with his wife Cathy and four children Talon, Alexandra (Lexie), Shane, and Gabriel. When talking about his children, Patrick's face lights up as he describes them as the ultimate joy and love of his life. With what little spare time he has, Patrick gets in a game of golf or tennis, does activities with his children, and spends time in his cabin on the Rogue River in Oregon with his family. Warburton also hosts the annual charity golf tournament \"Golf for Kids,\" a Celebrity Tournament to benefit St. Jude Children's Hospital each year in Palm Springs, CA.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyNzc5OTExN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU0MzYwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0911320","name":"Patrick Warburton","idIMDB":"nm0911320"},"actorId":"nm0911320","character":"Kronk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013419","main":true},{"actorName":"Wendie Malick","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005176","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE5MzM5NDIwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEzNzk3Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1950","placeOfBirth":" Buffalo, New York, USA","birthName":"Wendie Diane Malick","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"The actress Wendie Malick was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1950 and attended Ohio Wesleyan University, from which she graduated in 1972.

Many know the bald-pated Fiedler as therapy patient \"Mr. Peterson\" on The Bob Newhart Show (1972); others might first recognize him for the 1968 movie, The Odd Couple (1968), and spin-off TV show, The Odd Couple (1970), or perhaps even from the Broadway play that preceded them. Even kids would know that helium-high voice from animated Disney features like Robin Hood (1973), The Fox and the Hound (1981) and the \"Winnie the Pooh\" stories, in which he voiced \"Piglet\". The son of an Irish-German beer salesman, Fiedler knew he wanted to be an actor from his childhood days, when he had a full head of reddish-yellow hair. He made his first professional appearances onstage, branched out into live TV in New York and, then, during the 20 years he lived in Hollywood (1960-80), he turned up in many movies and an ever greater number of popular TV shows.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1Njg3NDg1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY2MTYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275835","name":"John
