He has appeared alongside many of the UK's stars and became hugely popular as a villain or hero. The secret of John's success was his versatility and his wonderful silky voice. He appeared in 3 Hammer films which led to an ever-increased popularity amongst film fans. John moved to South Africa from England in the 80s and, sadly, his appearances became far more sporadic although he always kept working, even producing and filming his own short documentary, \"African Spirit\". He the returned to England in 2007 and has been involved in a few films, such as The Deal (2008). He attended a John Carson Celebration Day in London (July 2009). This was the first time he had talked publicly about his long career in television, film and stage. The day was a huge success and, aside from a showing of two of his films, John gave an interview on stage and then signed autographs. The day was a huge success and this was proved so by a large attendance and the queues for his autograph and photos. John returned to South Africa in 2014 where he spent time with his family and got to relax a little. He sadly passed away on November 5th, 2016, he was a fine actor and leaves behind a legacy of his versatility on screen.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3ODg5NjUxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ1MzUyMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141264","name":"John Carson","idIMDB":"nm0141264"},"actorId":"nm0141264","character":"Miguel Terila","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Daneman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199399","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 October 1925","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Paul Daneman was born on October 29, 1925 in London, England.

A former jockey and steeplechase rider, he quickly forged ahead in films making his debut in The Warren Case (1934) and appearing in secondary roles. A tall, officious and good looking gent, he came into his own in post-war film leads and supports with prominent roles in The October Man (1947), Her Panelled Door (1950), The Dark Man (1951), Murder Will Out (1952), The Shadow Man (1953), and John Huston's cult overseas hit Beat the Devil (1953) starring Humphrey Bogart and Jennifer Jones in which he played Jones' prim dullard of a husband. Most of his work was in dismissible \"B\" level fare as dour, damp, stuffy types. He started moving down the credits list in 1960s horrors and action drama until he was reduced to bit parts. Over the course of his career, he played everything from British lords to archaeologists, but never branched out into a successful international career. Things might have turned out differently had a little more luck come his way. It seems writer Ian Fleming's first choice for the role of James \"007\" Bond was the handsome but still relatively undistinguished Underdown, but the actor was never even considered by producer Albert R. Broccoli. Of course, Sean Connery soared to stardom in the part and, ironically, Underdown wound up with a very small part in one of the more popular of the film series Thunderball (1965). Underdown died in his native England on December 15, 1989 at age 81.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0880956","name":"Edward Underdown","idIMDB":"nm0880956"},"actorId":"nm0880956","character":"Bennett Sanders","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1729208","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1729208","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["56 min"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.37 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"5.4","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"14","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0103169","name":"Merton Park Studios"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:12:02"}}
