His debut in films came in 1947 with The Smugglers (1947). His talents came to the forefront in the animated feature Animal Farm (1954), in which he voiced all of the animal characters. A prolific actor, his familiar sharp features and bald head appeared in dozens of films over the following years, often as charming but slightly \"balmy\" characters and well-bred cads, although he was more than capable of playing straight drama, as he did in the war picture Sink the Bismarck! (1960) as a naval officer helping to hunt down and sink the German battleship. He began appearing regularly in television in the 1970s and also worked steadily on the stage. He died of natural causes at age 92 in London, England.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219062","name":"Maurice Denham","idIMDB":"nm0219062"},"actorId":"nm0219062","character":"All Animals","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0411901","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0047834","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047834","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 12 min (72 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono (RCA Sound System)"],"color":["Color (Colour by) (Technicolor)"],"aspectRatio":["1.37 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Technicolor (colour by)"],"filmLength":["2,031 m (Netherlands)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.2","filmingLocations":[],"rated":"UNRATED","awards":[{"award":"BAFTA Awards 1956","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated BAFTA Film Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Animated Film","names":[]}]}]}],"votes":"11,055","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0260346","name":"Halas & Batchelor"},{"idCompany":"co0594675","name":"Office of Policy Coordination of Department of State and Defence"},{"idCompany":"co0594674","name":"RD-DR"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["revolution","pig","farm","revolt","hypocrisy","talking animal","animal that acts human","anti communist","communism","based on novel","farmer","satire","adult animation","discrimination","caged bird","blood","dog attack","cow","counting money","cat","camouflage","drinking","arm in a sling","food rationing","gluttony","hay","hen","lantern","phonograph","throwing eggs","pub","puppy","portrait","sickle","milk","snow","pigeon","teaching","education","dynamite","ambush","government corruption","cold war era","cold war","voice over narration","surrealism","politics","broken rule","murder","leader","human animal relationship","gunshot wound","dog","death sentence","construction","comrade","chicken","bed","battle","attack","fable","donkey","animal abuse","genocide","animal attack","allegory","corruption","horse","title spoken by character","manor","windmill","trade","fight","explosion","egg","death","alcoholic"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 03:40:43"}}
