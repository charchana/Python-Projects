Born in 1914 the son of a Swiss father and American mother, Howard received his dramatic training in both Berlin and Paris and was originally a stage and radio player (from 1945) before arriving in post-war French films. He articulated and personified a number of nefarious Nazis and sinister criminals in his five-decade career, although he could grab a sympathetic role from time such as in the French film Le Silence de la Mer (1949), which remains one of his best. Occasionally a still photographer, he forged a long, non-creative association beginning in the early 1960s with cult director Jess Franco following his good showing for Fritz Lang in _Tausend Augen des Dr. Mabuse, Die (1960)_ [The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]. With his piercing gaze and gravely-voiced he entered into an enduring alliance with Franco, albeit in dreadful schlock. It began promisingly enough with the horror classic The Awful Dr. Orlof (1962) [The Awful Dr. Orloff] in which he portrayed the creepy title role with a slightly sympathetic countenance, but his appearances quickly degenerated into cheap exploitation, void of deserving artistic merit. He died in Paris shortly after his 82nd birthday.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894677","name":"Howard Vernon","idIMDB":"nm0894677"},"actorId":"nm0894677","character":"Hermann","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Philippe Chemin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155134","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Philippe Chemin is an actor and cinematographer, known for Saint, martyr et poète (1975), Le théâtre des matières (1977) and La France (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155134","name":"Philippe Chemin","idIMDB":"nm0155134"},"actorId":"nm0155134","character":"Philippe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Martine Simonet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0800576","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Martine Simonet is an actress, known for Le dernier métro (1980), Simone Barbès ou la vertu (1980) and Les belles manières (1978).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0800576","name":"Martine Simonet","idIMDB":"nm0800576"},"actorId":"nm0800576","character":"Martine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brigitte Jaques","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0415136","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Brigitte Jaques is an actress and writer, known for Elvire-Jouvet 40 (1988), La place royale (1995) and Tot assajant Dom Juan (1994).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0415136","name":"Brigitte Jaques","idIMDB":"nm0415136"},"actorId":"nm0415136","character":"Brigitte","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Costa Comnene","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0968891","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Costa Comnene is an actor, known for Le théâtre des matières (1977), Lamento (1977) and Tam Tam (1976).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0968891","name":"Costa Comnene","idIMDB":"nm0968891"},"actorId":"nm0968891","character":"Repetos","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Serge Casado","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0142742","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Serge Casado is an actor, known for Le théâtre des matières (1977), Clin d'oeil (1984) and Les apprentis sorciers (1977).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0142742","name":"Serge Casado","idIMDB":"nm0142742"},"actorId":"nm0142742","character":"Serge","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-Christophe Bouvet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003133","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNjI0ODAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM4MzYwMjE@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 March 1947","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 7¾\" (1.72 m)","bio":"Jean-Christophe Bouvet was born on March 24, 1947 in Paris, France.

Raised by a very religious father who was an ex-pilot of the Great War (World War I). He attended a Jesuit private school in Saint Malo, during World War II, under the German invasion. In 1951, he did his military service in Germany. In 1953, after being judged guilty of petty theft, he met the owner of a docking company who gave him a chance as a manager of transports, in Nantes seaport. In 1956, he became a probationary in the postal services, then a factory worker. When he moved to Paris, he worked in news stands then in a book store, became a reporter for the \"Radar\" magazine, then worked at the prestigious \"Detective\" magazine. He became a movie critic, then assistant director. Thanks to Éric Rohmer he started working for the world renowned \"Les Cahiers du Cinema\" revue in November 1959 with all the new wave of French directors, later starts teaching cinema at La FEMIS( formerly called l'HIDEC). He had the privilege to work with 'Francois Truffaut', Jean-Luc Godard and interviewed Roman Polanski and Carl Theodor Dreyer, and many others. He was a close friend of Jean Renoir. He was fired from \"les Cahiers...\" in the late 1969 for being an anti-Marxiste. So he became a security officer, then a full time actor for theater, movies and television. In 1974 he wrote a novel \"L'Archange et Robinson font du Bateau\" destined to be a movie directed by Claude Miller and Gérard Depardieu as the lead role but the project never came to completion, so his script got published by the publishing house Champs Libre owned by Gerard Lebovici the founder of Artmedia agency. In late 1984, he became a social worker in a emergency team named 24/24, but quit in 1994. In 1998, he contributed to writing critics for \"La Lettre du Cinema\" and helped its young staff in screenwriting and acted in their movies. He has two sons: Emmanuel the oldest and Mathew Lorenceau the youngest (5 years apart).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0216155","name":"Michel Delahaye","idIMDB":"nm0216155"},"actorId":"nm0216155","character":"Le client","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Paulette Bouvet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0100422","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 May 1914","placeOfBirth":" Montpellier, Hérault, France","bio":"Paulette Bouvet was born on May 18, 1914 in Montpellier, Hérault, France.
