At age 18 Paul struck up a deal with the Devil and traded his soul for a 24oz framing hammer and a rusted out Honda. For nearly four years he worked himself to the bone padding his pocketbook and essentially mastering carpentry. Naturally, the next logical step was to go to theater school. Two years and 1479 coffees later he was certified. Or certifiable... but that's just nit-picking really. Since then Paul has been an active part of the North American acting community spreading joy and happiness everywhere he goes.

He was a fraternity man at Bowling Green State University, served in the army, and started his career working for a radio station. Conway got into comedy when he started writing and performing comedy skits between morning movies on CBS. Later, Rose Marie \"discovered\" him and he became a regular performer on The Steve Allen Plymouth Show (1956). However, Conway would not earn true fame until starring as \"Ensign Charles Parker\" on McHale's Navy (1962). Conway sought further success in several shows that were failures, including the embarrassingly short-lived, Turn-On (1969), with only one episode. The producers did not even want it back on after the commercial break! Even his own show, The Tim Conway Show (1970) flopped, with only 12 episodes. Conway starred in the Disney film, The Apple Dumpling Gang (1975), and also the films, The Prize Fighter (1979) and The Private Eyes (1980). Conway became a comical performer on The Carol Burnett Show (1967), with characters such as \"The Old Man\" and \"Mr. Tudball\". Even though it is widely thought he was always a regular performer throughout the whole show, he only became a regular performer in 1975. He was a hysterical addition to the team and memorably made co-star Harvey Korman laugh on-screen live many times. Conway had continued comedic roles such as \"Dorf\", and also in many more television appearances and films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MjgwNTIyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczNjA0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0176792","name":"Tim Conway","nicknames":["Timmy","Tom Conway"],"idIMDB":"nm0176792"},"actorId":"nm0176792","character":"Granddad Mayfield","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0563270","main":true},{"actorName":"Sebastian Gacki","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1753492","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyOTcyMzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE4NjIwOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 October 1984","placeOfBirth":" North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Sebastian Gacki was born on October 27, 1984 in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
