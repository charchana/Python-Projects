He is the son of Baroness Maria Margareta (Rappe), a teacher, and Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, an ethnologist and folklore professor. His surname traces back to his father's partial German ancestry. When he was in high school, he and a few fellow students, including Yvonne Lombard, started a theatre club which encouraged his interest in acting. After conscription, he began to study at the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school (1948-1951), together with Lars Ekborg, Margaretha Krook and Ingrid Thulin. His first role was as Nils the crofter in Alf Sjöberg's Only a Mother (1949). After graduation, he worked at the city theatres in Norrköping and Malmö. His work in the movies by Ingmar Bergman (especially The Seventh Seal (1957), that includes the iconic scenes in which he plays chess with Death) made him well-known internationally, and he started to get offers from abroad. His career abroad began with him playing Jesus in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965); Hawaii (1966) and The Quiller Memorandum (1966). Since then, his career includes very different kind of characters, like Karl Oskar Nilsson in The Emigrants (1971); Father Lankester Merrin in The Exorcist (1973); Joubert the assassin in Three Days of the Condor (1975), Emperor Ming in Flash Gordon (1980); the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the Never Say Never Again (1983); Liet-Kynes in Dune (1984) the artist Frederick in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986); Lassefar in Pelle the Conqueror (1987), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination; Dr. Peter Ingham in Awakenings (1990); Lamar Burgess in Minority Report (2002) and The Renter in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), which earned him his second Academy Award nomination. He has become one of Sweden's most admired and professional actors and is the only male Swedish actor to receive an Oscar nomination. Max has been nominated twice: for Pelle the Conqueror (1987) in 1988 and for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) in 2012. He received the Guldbagge Award for Best Director in his directing debut, the drama film Katinka (1988). In 2016, he joined the sixth season of the HBO series Game of Thrones (2011) as the Three-eyed Raven, which earned him his Primetime Emmy Award nomination.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MDQzOTMwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgyMjM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001884","name":"Max von Sydow","idIMDB":"nm0001884"},"actorId":"nm0001884","character":"Harry Haller","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dominique Sanda","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761212","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MjM2NjA5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI1MzM4OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 March 1948","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Dominique Marie-Françoise Renée Varaigne","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Dominique Sanda was born in 1948, in Paris, France. When she was 16, she left her upper-class family and married, but divorced two years later. She found a temporary job as a Vogue model, when Robert Bresson gave her the starring part in his absorbing drama Une femme douce (1969); she was quite impressive as a young woman who commits suicide when she finds out that her husband is unable to love her for what she really is. She was then offered the female lead in Vittorio De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1970), as the provocative daughter of a rich Jewish family. Afterwards, she worked with Bernardo Bertolucci on the much-discussed The Conformist (1970), as the sensual wife of an anti-fascist professor, and co-starred with Paul Newman in John Huston's spy thriller, The MacKintosh Man (1973). She worked again with Bertolucci in the epic, 1900 (1976), and won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Prize for her performance in Mauro Bolognini's The Inheritance (1976), as an Italian patriarch's daughter-in-law. She gave one more unforgettable performance in Jacques Demy's original musical, A Room in Town (1982), as a femme fatale. Today, in her fifties, she is still busy, appearing in international films and TV series.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MjM2NjA5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI1MzM4OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761212","name":"Dominique Sanda","nicknames":["Domino"],"idIMDB":"nm0761212"},"actorId":"nm0761212","character":"Hermine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pierre Clémenti","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167509","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzY5OTY2ZjAtMjIyZi00ODYxLTg4MDktMjg5MzQyNWU4ODRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 September 1942","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 11¾\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Pierre Clémenti was born on September 28, 1942 in Paris, France.
