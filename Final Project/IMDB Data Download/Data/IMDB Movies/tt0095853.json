She has appeared in both film and television and was voted Ford International Model of the Year in 1984. Jennifer was also the original Calvin Klein model for \"Obsession\". In 1987, she decided to devote herself to acting and accepted the role of \"Taryn White\" in the Wes Craven sequel, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), directed by Chuck Russell. Jennifer followed \"Elm Street 3\" with Bad Dreams (1988), Permanent Record (1988) with Keanu Reeves, and the Oliver Stone-directed The Doors (1991) starring Val Kilmer, a biopic based on the career of Jim Morrison and The Doors. By the mid-1990s, she was co-starring in films, such as The Crush (1993) with Cary Elwes and Planète hurlante (1995) alongside Peter Weller, the latter based on the science fiction novel by Philip K. Dick. Adaptable to various genres, it is apparent that Jennifer is much more than just a pretty face. She has produced - and starred in - the film, Road Kill (1999), and further appeared in popular TV series, including The Twilight Zone (1985), Tales from the Crypt (1989) and Au-delà du réel - l'aventure continue (1995). Jennifer appeared in Chris Isaak's music video for \"Somebody's Crying\" (1995), with Chris Penn.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTI2MjYxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDcwNDAzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0748075","name":"Jennifer Rubin","idIMDB":"nm0748075"},"actorId":"nm0748075","character":"Lauren","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0281504","main":true},{"actorName":"Michelle Meyrink","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001534","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDU1NzQ5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTczNDg5Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 September 1962","placeOfBirth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Michelle Meyrink was born on September 1, 1962 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu's mother is originally from England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career. After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Youngblood (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, River's Edge (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Dangerous Liaisons (1988) with director Stephen Frears. His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude \"Ted Logan\" in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard's comedy, Parenthood (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death (1990). Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix's narcoleptic male hustler in My Own Private Idaho (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Much Ado About Nothing (1993). In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and The Devil's Advocate (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and Chain Reaction (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure, The Matrix (1999). Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them The Replacements (2000), The Watcher (2000), The Gift (2000), Sweet November (2001), and Hardball (2001) - before The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003. Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Something's Gotta Give (2003), The Lake House (2006), and Street Kings (2008). He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008). And he's waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Thumbsucker (2005), The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009), and Henry's Crime (2010). Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronin (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Side by Side (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Man of Tai Chi (2013). In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film John Wick (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxNDcwMTg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4NDYyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206","name":"Keanu Reeves","nicknames":["The Wall","The One"],"idIMDB":"nm0000206"},"actorId":"nm0000206","character":"Chris Townsend","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0281511","main":true},{"actorName":"Phil Diskin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0228364","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1928","placeOfBirth":" Grodno, Poland [now Hrodna, Belarus]","birthName":"Philip Diskin","bio":"Phil Diskin was born on November 22, 1928 in Grodno, Poland as Philip Diskin.

The group soon became a part of Andy Warhol's Factory scene, which housed a great number of the most freaked and experimental artists at the time. The German singer and actress Nico sang in the group for a short period-- but the original line-up began to split up. The group, at its best, made only four original albums: \"The Velvet Underground & Nico\" (1967), \"White Light/White Heat\" (1968), \"The Velvet Underground\" (1969), and \"Loaded\" (1970). They stand today as milestones in the history of rock. In 1970, Lou Reed began his solo career. His second album, \"Transformer\" (1972), was produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, long-time admirers of the Velvets. That year, he had his first--and still only--top 20 song, \"Walk on the Wild Side.\" Through the 1970s, he made a prolific number of albums with \"Berlin\" (1973), \"Rock 'n' Roll Animal\" (1974), and \"Street Hassle\" (1978) as the artistic highlights of this period. On St. Valentine's Day 1980, Lou Reed married Sylvia Morales, and that was another turning point in his career. The following album, \"The Blue Mask\" (1982), stands as one of his best and most composed. In 1989, he made \"New York\"--a love letter to his city with its good and bad, and with a heavy criticism of American thought. In the 1990s, he continued to be one of the most sharp-tongued rock 'n' roll poets of his time. In 1990, he once again collaborated with ex-Velvet-partner John Cale. Their album, \"Songs for Drella,\" was a very personal tribute to friend and artist Andy Warhol, who had recently died. In 1993, The Velvet Underground was re-formed with its original line-up, and toured in Europe in 1993. In 1997, Lou Reed, along with former Velvet band mates John Cale, Maureen Tucker, and the late Sterling Morrison were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Lou Reed stood as one of the most important songwriters of our time and has served as inspiration to a multitude of artists such as David Bowie, Nick Cave, Sonic Youth, Nine Inch Nails, U2, David Byrne and Patti Smith.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA0MDgyNDExNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE1ODQyOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0715563","name":"Lou Reed","idIMDB":"nm0715563"},"actorId":"nm0715563","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Garrett Lambert","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0483147","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Garrett Lambert is an actor and producer, known for Permanent Record (1988) and The Horror Within (2005).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0483147","name":"Garrett Lambert","idIMDB":"nm0483147"},"actorId":"nm0483147","character":"Producer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0281522","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Bradford","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0103071","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAxMzk2MDQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUxMzYwOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 November 1934","placeOfBirth":" Conroe, Texas, USA","birthName":"Richard Edwin Bradford Jr.","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Richard Bradford was born on November 10, 1934 in Conroe, Texas, USA as Richard Edwin Bradford Jr. He was an actor, known for The Untouchables (1987), Man in a Suitcase (1967) and The Milagro Beanfield War (1988).
