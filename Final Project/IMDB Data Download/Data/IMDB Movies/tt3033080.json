Thanks to a long family history in musical theatre, he has been involved in theatrical productions for most of his life and has studied alongside some of the most influential directors, writers and actors in the business to date. He has met and worked with well known and up-and-coming actors, both directing and starring alongside them, in a variety of productions for several professional companies. After college, he went straight into work and landed a 4 month contract for a children's show \"The Rangers\", produced by Antony Audenshaw (Emmerdale), honing his skills in street theatre, skin work and compère. During his work as a compère he was given the opportunity to become a presenter and interviewer for a variety of programs for TV and Radio. This led to the an interview for the Bigger Breakfast on Channel 4. In 2000 he landed the lead role in the short film 'The Fall', financed by Film 4, and has made numerous short films since, mostly playing the lead which have helped him hone his skills making him an experienced actor on film. His first big break came in 2003 being cast in \"Closer\". Then in 2004 he took a more active role in film production, giving him a bigger insight to the world behind the camera as a writer, editor and in other aspects of film and stage. In 2008 he produced a documentary on a dance installation \"Duets for Unusual Souls\" with Angela Praed (Random Dance) recreating the Dance marathons (walkathons) held in the 1920's-1930's during the Great Depression. From this success, the crew formed a production company (Blue Slug) and went onto make films, music videos and outsource to other companies including 24 Productions, BBC and Warner Brothers.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1919957","name":"Stuart Lawson","idIMDB":"nm1919957"},"actorId":"nm1919957","character":"News Reporter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Caron Reidy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5665074","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NDMwMjgwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwNDg2MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Caron was born in July 1973 in Bristol, UK.
