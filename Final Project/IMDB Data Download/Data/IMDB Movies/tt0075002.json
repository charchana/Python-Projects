Buster Larsen was born Axel Landing Larsen, a name which he later chanced to Buster Larsen. He was born in Copenhagen. Even as a child his talent for acting was recognised. He was a child actor at the age of 8, when he had his debut at \"Politikens Børneteater\". Later (1932 - 1934) he acted at theatre in Nørrebro (which is in Copenhagen), and also in the theatre in the Danish city of Aalborg. Larsen afterwards worked in many theatres throughout Denmark. Buster Larsen had his film debut as a naughty schoolboy in a movie from 1933 called: \"De blaa drenge\", he was 12 years old. After his film debut, Larsen had a lot of roles in different movies in the 1940ties and 1950ties - but he had not yet gotten the major breakthrough, in the publics view. Buster Larsen's major breakthrough came in 1959, where he got his own TV Series called: \"Cirkus Buster\", where he played the central figure (as a circus director). \"Cirkus Buster\" ran from 1959 - 1961. \"Cirkus Buster\" had also spawned much comedic and acting talent: the well-known Danish actor, Tommy Kenter, was discovered by Buster Larsen. \"Cirkus Buster\" was so successful that it eventually was made into a feature film, also named \"Cirkus Buster\". The \"Cirkus Buster\" movie was made in 1961. It was directed by the well-known Danish director: Erik Balling. \"Cirkus Buster\" was all in all a parody of European circuses. Buster Larsen was a frequent quest in the Danish satire program \"Hov Hov\". In \"Hov Hov\" he became famous for making a caricature of a well-known Danish politician named Erhard Jacobsen. In 1971 Buster Larsen acted in Ludvig Holberg's play:\"Jeppe på Bjerget\", which brought him much recognition. In the 1970ties he acted in many well-know movies like: Hovedjægerne (1971), Kassen stemmer (1976), Olsen-banden ser rødt (1976) and Hærværk (1977). In 1978 the Danish TV-epic \"Matador\" started filming. Buster Larsen landed a major part in \"Matador\" as the down-to-earth Hog-dealer Oluf Larsen. \"Matador\" brought Buster Larsen even more fame. In the 1980ties Buster Larsen acted in the Danish mini-TV-Series: \"Busters verden\" (which did not refer to Buster Larsen). The mini-TV-Series: \"Busters verden\" was so succesfull that it eventually was made into a feature-film: Busters verden (1984). In the 80ties Buster Larsen worked in several notable movies, including: \"Jeppe på bjerget (1981) (which was a movie-remake of the successful play, of the same name\", Midt om natten (1984) and Pelle erobreren (1987) (aka Pelle the Conqueror (USA), directed by Bille August). His last work includes the two very popular children-movies, from the start of the 1990ties: Krummerne (1991) and Krummerne 2: Stakkels Krumme (1992), which became his last film.
