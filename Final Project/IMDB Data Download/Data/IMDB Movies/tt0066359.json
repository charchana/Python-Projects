After two years of college education (classes of Drama and Arts), she started a career as soft-porn actress in about 200 16mm films and 35mm. features, several of which were with her very close friend Uschi Digard. After establishing her name in the field, her pay went to $75 a day (average) when shooting a film. The number of feature films in which she is credited is small, possibly because she refused to do hard-core. She joined SAG and later had small roles in mainstream features and had a successful stage career as an actress, where she also directed several plays.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0333635","name":"Neola Graef","idIMDB":"nm0333635"},"actorId":"nm0333635","character":"Shorter Blond Cult Member","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kathy Hilton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385277","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kathy Hilton is an actress, known for Escape to Passion (1970), The Toy Box (1971) and Carnal Knowledge (1970).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385277","name":"Kathy Hilton","idIMDB":"nm0385277"},"actorId":"nm0385277","character":"Cult Member in Coffin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Jones","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4934559","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Don Jones is an actor, known for Sex Ritual of the Occult (1970).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4934559","name":"Don Jones","idIMDB":"nm4934559"},"actorId":"nm4934559","character":"Guy on Bench","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marland Proctor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0698405","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE2MTM1MDMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYwNjU1MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1939","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Marland Gail Proctor","bio":"Marland Proctor was born on September 19, 1939 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Marland Gail Proctor.
