His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family in New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe. The family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin's first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River's sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982). He worked with his brother again on the afterschool special ABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp SpaceCamp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Russkies (1987). In the late '80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River's film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn't sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Parenthood (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world. His parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman's obsessive devotee in To Die For (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics' darling in his own right. His follow-up turn in Inventing the Abbotts (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to future fiancée Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone's U Turn - Ici commence l'enfer (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Return to Paradise (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Clay Pigeons (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8 mm (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Gladiator (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe's swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role. Later that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade's asylum in Quills (2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musician Johnny Cash in the biography Walk the Line (2005). He also recorded an album, the film's soundtrack, for which he received the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAzNjg5MDE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIxNzU0OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618","name":"Joaquin Phoenix","nicknames":["Kitten","Joaq","Leaf"],"idIMDB":"nm0001618"},"actorId":"nm0001618","character":"Larry \"Doc\" Sportello","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0383781","main":true},{"actorName":"Jordan Christian Hearn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5713860","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MTU3ODIzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE3MjU2MzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Jordan Christian Hearn is an actor, known for Inherent Vice (2014), The Security Guards (2014) and Medicine Men.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MTU3ODIzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE3MjU2MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5713860","name":"Jordan Christian Hearn","idIMDB":"nm5713860"},"actorId":"nm5713860","character":"Denis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Taylor Bonin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4293207","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Taylor Bonin is a cinematographer and writer, known for Lacrimosa, Inherent Vice (2014) and Eleven Eleven (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4293207","name":"Taylor Bonin","idIMDB":"nm4293207"},"actorId":"nm4293207","character":"Ensenada Slim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeannie Berlin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0075588","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMTk2NDkxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzkwMDEwMDE@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 November 1949","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Jeannie Brette May","bio":"Jeannie Berlin was born on November 1, 1949 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Jeannie Brette May.

Brolin","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Rugged features and a natural charm have worked for Josh Brolin, the son of actor James Brolin. He has recently seen a massive surge in his career, finding well-known roles such as a policeman, a hunter, and the President of the United States. Brolin was born February 12, 1968 in Santa Monica, California, to Jane Cameron (Agee), a Texas-born wildlife activist, and James Brolin. Josh was initially against the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents' divorce, and both of them being actors. However, during junior year in high school, he took an acting class to see what it was like and played Stanley in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film The Goonies (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles on such series as Alien Private Eye (1988) and The Young Riders (1989). \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin's father, James Brolin. After The Young Riders (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in The Road Killers (1994), but the film was not a success. He followed up with the crime film Gang in Blue (1996), the romantic film Bed of Roses (1996), the thriller film Nightwatch (1997), and appeared with his father in My Brother's War (1997). However, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop The Mod Squad (1999). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin's career. He appeared in the independent film Slow Burn (2000), the sci-if thriller Hollow Man (2000) and starred on the television series Mister Sterling (2003). In 2004, he married actress Diane Lane and are still together. It was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-written Grindhouse (2007) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: a corrupt officer \"Trupo\" in the crime epic American Gangster (2007), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama In the Valley of Elah (2007) which starred Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by Paul Haggis. However, it was his involvement in No Country for Old Men (2007) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin (Javier Bardem, who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. Brolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as \"Supervisor Dan White\" in the film Milk (2008). His performance as the weak and bitter politician earned him an Oscar nomination, and Brolin received more praise for his fascinating portrayal of George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone film W. (2008). Despite the mediocre success of W. (2008), he was recognized as the best part of the film, and Milk (2008) was another triumph, critically and commercially. Brolin then acted in the smaller comedy Women in Trouble (2009) before landing a number of large roles in 2010. The first of these was the film based on the comic book figure Jonah Hex (2010). The film was a box office flop and critically panned, but Brolin also forged a second collaboration with legendary director Oliver Stone for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010). Brolin played a large role alongside such young stars as Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf, and older thespians such as Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella. Brolin's character was Bretton James, a top banker in the film, and also the film's chief antagonist. Brolin also appeared in Woody Allen's London-based film You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010) and a second collaboration with the Coen Brothers, which was a remake of True Grit (1969). Despite his earlier mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films and, recently, these choices have paid off profoundly. Hopefully, he continues this streak of good fortune that his talents have finally given him.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MzYyMjQ0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0ODkyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000982","name":"Josh Brolin","idIMDB":"nm0000982"},"actorId":"nm0000982","character":"Lt.

He is the son of Betty Lou (Bredemus) and Walter Grady Roberts, one-time actors and playwrights. His siblings are actors Lisa Roberts Gillan and Julia Roberts, and he grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. He began his acting career at age 5 in a local theater company called the \"Actors and Writers Workshop\", founded by his late father. After his schooling at Grady High, he studied drama at age 17 in London for two years at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, then returned to the States and continued his studies at the American Academy in New York. He made his NY stage debut in \"Rebel Women\" in 1976 at age 20 and appeared in regional productions, once playing the newspaper boy in a production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" starring Shirley Knight and Glenn Close. After appearing in such daytime soaps as Another World (1964) and How to Survive a Marriage (1974), his career began to shift fast forward when he copped a leading role in a major film. In King of the Gypsies (1978), based on Peter Maas' best-seller about a fracturing dynasty of New York City gypsies, he made his debut alongside an intimidating roster of stars including Judd Hirsch, Susan Sarandon, Shelley Winters and Sterling Hayden. Young Eric held his own expertly (winning a Golden Globe nomination) while his burning intensity and brooding charm marked sure signs of star potential. After this, he won the lead opposite Milo O'Shea in the 1980 stage production of \"Mass Appeal\". He suffered serious injuries in a car accident during his nascent film career but lost no fans by the time he returned to co-star with Sissy Spacek as a small-town stranger in Raggedy Man (1981). It was, however, his stark and frightening portrayal of two-bit hustler Paul Snider, the cast-off boyfriend who slays Playmate-turned-movie starlet Dorothy Stratten (played by Mariel Hemingway) in Star 80 (1983) that really put him on the movie map and earned him a second Golden Globe nomination. A wide range of fascinating, whacked-out roles were immediately offered to him on a silver plate. He played another dangerous streetwise hustler type in The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984) opposite fellow rebel Mickey Rourke; a cocky soda pop sales exec in the Australian comedy Coca-Cola kid (1985); appeared with more charm and restraint opposite Rosanna Arquette in the offbeat romantic comedy Nobody's Fool (1986) and topped his prolific period off with an Academy Award nomination as a young prison escapee hiding out with Jon Voight aboard an out-of-control train in the ultra-violent, character-driven action adventure Runaway Train (1985). Good things continued to happen when he was a replacement lead in the original run of \"Burn This\" and won a Theatre World Award for his 1988 Broadway debut. A risky, no-holds-barred actor, he was often guilty of overacting if given half the chance. His film career began to slide in the late 1980s, appearing in more quantity than quality pictures. A series of missteps led to unheralded appearances in such bombs as the karate-themed Best of the Best (1989); the NY urban thriller The Ambulance (1990); the action western Blood Red (1989), which took three years to release and is the only film Eric and his sister Julia Roberts appeared in together; and Rude Awakening (1989) when he filled in as a burned-out hippie opposite a Chong-less Cheech Marin. More under appreciated \"B\" filming came with the 1990s (Freefall (1994), Sensation (1994), The Nature of the Beast (1995), etc.), while also chewing the scenery with a number of mobster types in TV-movies, including one as \"Al Capone\". He soon began appearing as flashy secondary villains and creepies that showcased other stars instead, such as Final Analysis (1992) starring Richard Gere, Heaven's Prisoners (1996) top lining Alec Baldwin, and The Dark Knight (2008), part of the \"Batman\" series with Christian Bale and the late Heath Ledger. Eric's undeniable, unconventional talent would occasionally mesh with the perfect role. At the Sundance Film Festival in 1996, he received critical applause for his starring role as a man dying of AIDS in the uplifting and emotional film It's My Party (1996) and earned more honors as a writer marked for murder in the mob-themed story La Cucaracha (1998). He was also perfectly cast as one of the cold-blooded killers in the Emmy-nominated TV adaptation of Truman Capote's chiller In Cold Blood (1996). Eric continued to appear sporadically on TV in such dramatic series as Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001), while sometimes showing a fun side as well in comedy (The King of Queens (1998)). His own series work included Less Than Perfect (2002) and, more recently, and in the cult program Heroes (2006) where promise for a longer participation ended with his character's death. Recovered from a long-standing cocaine problem, Eric wed, for the first time, actress/writer Eliza Roberts (nee Garrett). They have appeared in such films as Killer Weekend (2004) and Final Approach (2005). His daughter from a former relationship, Emma Roberts, is a newly popular and fast-rising \"tween\" actress from the series Unfabulous (2004) and has played youthful super-sleuth Nancy Drew (2007) on film. Eric's unpredictable, volatile nature which works so mesmerizing on screen has also led to troubling times off camera; his relationship with younger sis Julia Roberts has been seriously strained for quite some time.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MTk3OTgwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE1OTIwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000616","name":"Eric Roberts","idIMDB":"nm0000616"},"actorId":"nm0000616","character":"Michael Z.

Her mother was African-American and her father is Ashkenazi Jewish (from a family from Lithuania, Russia, Germany, and Hungary). In 1973, Maya, her parents, and her older brother, Marc Rudolph, moved to California to further Minnie's music career. Here Minnie recorded \"Lovin' You\", her most famous single, in which one can hear her sing \"Maya, Maya, Maya\" at the end of the song; Riperton claimed that this song was used as a lullaby for Maya. During adolescence, Maya attended St. Augustine by the Sea School, where she met childhood friend, Gwyneth Paltrow. The Paltrows and the Rudolphs became family friends and, in 2000, Dick Rudolph and Maya filled the role of music supervisors on the Bruce Paltrow-directed film Duets (2000), which starred Gwyneth. In 1990, Maya enrolled at the University of California at Santa Cruz, majoring in photography. It was here that Maya formed the band \"Supersauce\" with fellow students. After graduation in 1994, Maya left the band and soon joined The Rentals, fronted by Weezer bassist Matt Sharp. Maya was featured on the 1999 release \"Seven More Minutes\", where she sang backup vocals on \"Barcelona\" and \"My Head is in the Sun\". Maya began touring with the group, singing backup and playing Moog synthesizer. When The Rentals disbanded, Maya decided to pursue her dream of a career in comedy, joining the famed troupe \"The Groundlings\". On May 6, 2000, Maya joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (1975). and has since become one of that show's most popular performers. Favorite sketches include a dead-on impression of fashion diva Donatella Versace; high school flake \"Megan\", the host of her own morning talk show, \"Wake-up WakeField\"; and one of the members of the R&B parody \"Gemini's Twin\".

Williams was raised in the Vandaveer housing projects in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York City and attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School. According to a DNA analysis, he is descended partly from the Mende people of Sierra Leone. After getting in some trouble as a youth, he enrolled at the National Black Theatre in New York City. He later got a job at a pharmaceutical company. Inspired by Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, he left school and quit his job, against the wishes of his family, to pursue a career as a dancer. During a year in which he was intermittently homeless, Williams visited record labels and dance studios looking for work. He got a job as a background dancer on a music tour for Akym Sims' dance anthem Too Blind To See It, which led to more work appearing as a dancer in videos and on tours, such as with George Michael, Madonna, as well as some modelling work. He also choreographed Crystal Waters' 1994 single \"100% Pure Love\". He is an established actor and producer, perhaps best-known for his role on the highly-acclaimed HBO Television series The Wire (2002) where he played Omar Little. Other notable works he performed in have included The Road (2009) Boardwalk Empire (2010), 12 Years a Slave (2013) and RoboCop (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNTg2NjA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ4NzY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931324","name":"Michael Kenneth Williams","idIMDB":"nm0931324"},"actorId":"nm0931324","character":"Tariq Khalil","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0478978","main":true},{"actorName":"Hong Chau","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2186865","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MzQ3NDA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc3Mjc4NQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Hong Chau is an actress and writer, known for Downsizing (2017), Inherent Vice (2014) and Treme (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MzQ3NDA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc3Mjc4NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2186865","name":"Hong Chau","idIMDB":"nm2186865"},"actorId":"nm2186865","character":"Jade","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0500450","main":true},{"actorName":"Shannon Collis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1711948","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NDI5MDM1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA1NTA0NzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 April 1986","placeOfBirth":" Lawrence, Kansas, USA","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Shannon Collis was born on April 26, 1986 in Lawrence, Kansas, USA.

Tarantino then hired Christopher again when he directed the series finale of \"CSI\". Christopher was also a regular in the Spike TV comedy series \"The Factory\" as Don.
