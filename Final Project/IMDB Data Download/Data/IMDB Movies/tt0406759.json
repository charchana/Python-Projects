Her mother has Danish, Welsh, German, English, and French ancestry, while her father is of Mexican descent (including Spanish, Indigenous Mexican, and distant Sephardic Jewish, roots). Her family moved to Biloxi, MS, when she was an infant. Three years later her father's career brought the family back to California, then to Del Rio, TX, before finally settling in Southern California when Jessica was nine. In love with the idea of becoming an actress from the age of five, she was 12 before she took her first acting class. Nine months later she was signed by an agent. She studied at the Atlantic Theatre Company with founders William H. Macy and David Mamet. A gifted young actress, Jessica has played a variety of roles ranging from light comedy to gritty drama since beginning her career. She made her feature film debut in 1993 in Hollywood Pictures' comedy Camp Nowhere (1994). Originally hired for two weeks, she got her break when an actress in a principal role suddenly dropped out. Jessica cheerfully admits it wasn't her prodigious talent or charm that inspired the director to tap her to take over the part--it was her hair, which matched the original performer's. The two-week job stretched to two months, and Jessica ended the film with an impressive first credit. Two national TV commercials for Nintendo and J.C. Penney quickly followed before Jessica was featured in several independent films. She branched out into TV in 1994 with a recurring role in Nickelodeon's popular comedy series The Secret World of Alex Mack (1994). She played an insufferable young snob, devoted to making life miserable for the the title character, played by Larisa Oleynik. That same year, she won the role of \"Maya\" in Flipper (1995) and filmed the pilot for the series. She spent 1995 shooting the first season's episodes in Australia. An avid swimmer and PADI-certified SCUBA diver, Jessica was delighted to be doing a show that allowed her to play with dolphins. The show's success guaranteed it a second season, which she also starred in. Her involvement in the show lasted from 1995 to 1997. In 1996 she appeared in Venus Rising (1995) as \"Young Eve\". The next year she appeared on The Dini Petty Show (1989), a Canadian talk show, and spoke about her role in \"Flipper\" and her general acting career. She began working on P.U.N.K.S. (1999), featuring Randy Quaid, in 1998. In early 1998 she appeared in Brooklyn South (1997) as \"Melissa\". That same year she was in two episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990) as \"Leanne\" and in two episodes of Love Boat: The Next Wave (1998). She appeared in \"Teen Magazine\" in 1995 and various European magazines over the following years. More importantly, she was featured in the February 1999 issue of \"Vanity Fair\" magazine. She also had major roles in two movies that year: Never Been Kissed (1999) and Idle Hands (1999). In 2000 she had roles in Paranoid (2000) and starred in the sci-fi TV series Dark Angel (2000), gaining worldwide recognition. Her first starring role in a major studio film was the Honey (2003), Universal Pictures' contemporary urban drama that grossed over $60 million worldwide. She has since made over 25 feature films that have earned a combined box-office total of over $800 million, including comedies and dramas, from gritty independents to major studio blockbusters. In 2005 she starred opposite Bruce Willis and an all-star cast in the provocative and critically acclaimed Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller. She next starred as Sue Storm--\"The Invisible Girl\"--in Marvel's action-franchise blockbuster Fantastic Four (2005), which was released by 20th Century-Fox in July 2005 and became a worldwide box-office success with over $300 million in revenue. Jessica was part of Garry Marshall's all-star ensemble romantic comedy, Valentine's Day (2010), which broke box-office records with the largest opening on a four-day President's Day weekend in history. She starred opposite Casey Affleck and Kate Hudson in director Michael Winterbottom's controversial screen adaptation of The Killer Inside Me (2010), based on Jim Thompson's novel, as well as Robert Rodriquez's Machete (2010). She co-starred in the third installment of the hit \"Meet the Parents\" franchise Little Fockers (2010), as well as the 4D family adventure Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D (2011), marking her third of five collaborations with Robert Rodriguez. Jessica was part of an all-star voice cast for The Weinstein Company's animated adventure, Escape from Planet Earth (2013), also featuring Sarah Jessica Parker, Brendan Fraser and James Gandolfini. She appeared in the comedy A.C.O.D. (2013), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and starred Adam Scott, Jane Lynch and Amy Poehler. She made a cameo appearance in Machete Kills (2013) and co-starred in Robert Rodriquez's highly-anticipated, star-studded sequel Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014).

She has four brothers, all older, including actor Trevor Duke-Moretz. Her ancestry is mostly German and English. Chloë's first two appearances were as Violet in two episodes of the series The Guardian (2001). Her first movie role was as Molly in Heart of the Beholder (2005), a story about a family that opened the first video rental store in 1980. This was followed by a small role in Family Plan (2005) as Young Charlie. After that, however, came Chloe's biggest role, and the one that made her famous: The Amityville Horror (2005), the remake of the famous The Amityville Horror (1979). Next she landed a small role in Today You Die (2005) as the Little Girl, and has since appeared in Room 6 (2006) and Big Momma's House 2 (2006). She filmed Wicked Little Things (2006) in Bulgaria, in which she plays Emma Tunney. In 2007 she completed The Third Nail (2007), in which she appeared as Hailey Deonte. In 2010 she appeared as Hit-Girl in director Matthew Vaughn's action film Kick-Ass (2010), based on the comic book series of the same name by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. Although her role in the violent action film engendered some controversy, she received widespread critical acclaim for her portrayal. Moretz trained with Jackie Chan's stunt crew for three months prior to filming \"Kick-Ass\" and did most of her own stunts in the film. Also that year she played Abby, a 12-year-old vampire, in Let Me In (2010), the UK/US remake of the Swedish film Let the Right One In (2008), which was released on October 1, 2010. She played Ann Sliger in the crime thriller Texas Killing Fields (2011), released on October 14, 2011. Chloe next played Isabelle in Martin Scorsese's Hugo (2011), a film adaptation of \"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\". \"Hugo\", which was nominated for 11 Oscars, co-starred Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helen McCrory. Moretz then starred in Hick (2011), an adaptation of the novel by Andrea Portes. She was in Tim Burton's Dark Shadows (2012), based on the iconic TV series Dark Shadows (1966), playing the role of Carolyn Stoddard, a rebellious teenage daughter. In 2013 she reprised her role as Hit-Girl in the sequel Kick-Ass 2 (2013), which received mixed reviews, but once again her performance was highly praised. The same year she also appeared in a short segment in Movie 43 (2013) and played the title character in Carrie (2013), a remake of Carrie (1976), based on a Stephen King story and directed by Kimberly Peirce. In January 2013 Moretz was chosen to play Mia in the film adaptation of Gayle Forman's If I Stay (2014), which was released in August 2014. On January 16, 2014, it was announced Moretz would appear in an off-Broadway show directed by Steven Soderbergh entitled \"The Library\". In 2014 Chloë was in six films: a cameo as a newspaper girl in Muppets Most Wanted (2014), the female lead of prostitute Teri alongside Denzel Washington in The Equalizer (2014) and teenage party girl Annika with Keira Knightley and Sam Rockwell in Laggies (2014). In December she played the role of very young Hollywood actress with a scandalous reputation Jo-Ann Ellis alongside Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche in Sils Maria (2014). In April it was announced that Chloë would be playing the lead role of Cassie Sullivan in The 5th Wave (2016), another adaptation similar to The Hunger Games (2012), alongside Nick Robinson and Alex Roe. It was later announced that Chloë would play the lead female role of Digger in the movie adaptation of Sam Munson's novel \"November Criminals\". Moretz's character is the best friend of Addison Schacht, played by Ansel Elgort,","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2ODk0Mzc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYzMzgzMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1631269","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz","nicknames":["Chloë Grace","Chloe the braniac"],"idIMDB":"nm1631269"},"actorId":"nm1631269","character":"Alicia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0222538","main":true},{"actorName":"Brett A.
