He, along with peers Vittorio Gassman, Ugo Tognazzi and Nino Manfredi, arguably represent the finest of post-war Italian cinema history. Born in Rome on June 15, 1920 in the Trastevere district, Sordi grew up in a musical family, his father being a tuba player for the Rome Opera House. A choir boy at the Sistine Chapel, he later trained for the theater in Milan but returned to Rome to work in radio and musical halls in comedy shows. In the late 30s he found his way into film as an extra. His first important role was in The Three Pilots (1942), a fascist war picture, but he wouldn't hit international stardom until a decade later when he starred in Federico Fellini's early films The White Sheik (1952) and I Vitelloni (1953). The titles of some of his most prolific characters were as simple as their titles: The Seducer, The Bachelor, The Husband, The Widower, The Traffic Cop, and The Moralist. Most of his protagonists amusingly, but not always pleasantly, stereotyped the worst attributes of Italian men and society, yet many of his films are unparalleled in quality and considered masterpieces. Sordi went on to star, direct and co-write more than 150 films. Never married and rather an introvert, he enjoyed a quiet, reclusive personal life. On his 80th birthday, he was made Mayor of Rome for the day. In 2002, after 190 films, he announced his retirement, and died of a heart attack the following year at age 82.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjA5ODUyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU1OTc0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814773","name":"Alberto Sordi","nicknames":["Albertone"],"idIMDB":"nm0814773"},"actorId":"nm0814773","character":"Rosario 'Sasà' Scimoni","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marco Guglielmi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0346581","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 December 1926","placeOfBirth":" Sanremo, Liguria, Italy","bio":"Marco Guglielmi was born on December 23, 1926 in Sanremo, Liguria, Italy.

Revealed by \"Desiderio\" (1943-1946), started in 1943 by Roberto Rossellini and completed in 1946 by Marcello Pagliero, she appeared as a sex-hungry vamp men had better not mix with. In her next film, directed by her husband Aldo Vergano, \"Il sole sorge ancora\" (1946), an important work about Italian Resistance, she was once again on the wrong side of morality as the provocatively beautiful noblewoman who tries to seduce her lover out of right-minded Lea Padovani's arms. However this ability to embody the ruthless seductress proved a mixed blessing. Indeed, as she grew older, Elli Parvo had the same problem as her French look alike Ginette Leclerc: either she was reduced to parody herself, like the comical vamp she played in \"Toto terzo uomo\" (1951), or she got more and more insignificant supporting parts in the films of the nineteen fifties. As no director or producer gave her a real opportunity to express all her talent, she finally called it quits after a last foray into an Italian comedy. She can nevertheless be seen in Antonioni's heart-rending \"Il grido\" (1957).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664132","name":"Elli Parvo","idIMDB":"nm0664132"},"actorId":"nm0664132","character":"Emma - la moglie del sindaco","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Armenia Balducci","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0049833","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 March 1933","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","bio":"Armenia Balducci was born on March 13, 1933 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.
