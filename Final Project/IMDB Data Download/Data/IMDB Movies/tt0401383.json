At least, that's what the press releases claimed; actually, the tall, elastic-faced Cassel had been plugging away in films on a minor basis since 1950. Shortly after, Cassel was perfectly cast in the naif title role in the 1958 film version of Voltaire's Candide. He has since been a stalwart in the comedies of director Philippe de Broca, nearly always playing latter-day variations of the ingenuous Candide. Since this time, he is the screen-lover of some of the best actresses like Jean Seberg, Brigitte Bardot, Claude Jade, Catherine Deneuve, Stéphane Audran or Marie Dubois. He played in Gérard Brach's The Boat on the Grass (1971) (1970) with Claude Jade and John McEnery. In 1974, Jean-Pierre Cassel added thousands of American filmgoers to his fan following with his appearances as the bumbling King Louis XIII in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers: Milady's Revenge (1974).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxODEzMzY2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc5Mzc0MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144045","name":"Jean-Pierre Cassel","idIMDB":"nm0144045"},"actorId":"nm0144045","character":"Père Lucien et le Vendeur","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0111407","main":true},{"actorName":"Marina Hands","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0359652","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyMzc1Mzc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY3OTM2NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 January 1975","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Daughter of French actress Ludmila Mikaël and British stage director and actor Terry Hands, granddaughter of famous French painter Pierre Dmitrienko, the discrete and beautiful Marina Hands first wanted to be a professional horse-rider but, eventually, had to give up these dreams. In 1995, she followed a French acting school, the \"Cours Florent\". After, she then studied at the Conservatoire National d'Art Dramatique and spent one year in England at the London Academy of Music and Arts. In 1999, she made her stage début alongside Robert Hirsch in Dion Boucicault's \"Le bel air de Londres\" for which she has been nominated for the Molières (the equivalent of the American Tony's). In her young career, she has already worked with some of the most prestigious stage directors, such as Patrice Chéreau who offered her the role of Aricie in Racine's \"Phèdre\" in which she revealed herself as an accomplished tragedienne. Marina Hands made her real movie debut with 'Andrzej Zulawski' ((Fidelity (2000)) and appeared in Denys Arcand's The Barbarian Invasions (2003), Yves Angelo's Les âmes grises (2005), next to Jean-Pierre Marielle and Guillaume Canet's Tell No One (2006), next to François Cluzet. 2006 has been the year of her international recognition when Pascale Ferran offered her the leading part in Lady Chatterley (2006) in which she gave a stunning performance as a young English woman discovering life, love and sensuality; a role for which she received the Best Actress award at the Césars 2007 ceremony (the equivalent of the American Oscars). It is also in 2006 that she joined the prestigious Comédie Française where she has played the Princess in \"Tête d'Or\" (2006) and will soon play Ysé in \"Partage de Midi\", two masterpieces of French writer Paul Claudel.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyMzc1Mzc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY3OTM2NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0359652","name":"Marina Hands","idIMDB":"nm0359652"},"actorId":"nm0359652","character":"Joséphine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0085719","main":true},{"actorName":"Max von Sydow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001884","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MDQzOTMwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgyMjM1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 April 1929","placeOfBirth":" Lund, Skåne län, Sweden","birthName":"Max Carl Adolf von Sydow","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Max von Sydow was born Carl Adolf von Sydow on April 10, 1929 in Lund, Skåne, Sweden, to a middle-class family. He is the son of Baroness Maria Margareta (Rappe), a teacher, and Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, an ethnologist and folklore professor. His surname traces back to his father's partial German ancestry. When he was in high school, he and a few fellow students, including Yvonne Lombard, started a theatre club which encouraged his interest in acting. After conscription, he began to study at the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school (1948-1951), together with Lars Ekborg, Margaretha Krook and Ingrid Thulin. His first role was as Nils the crofter in Alf Sjöberg's Only a Mother (1949). After graduation, he worked at the city theatres in Norrköping and Malmö. His work in the movies by Ingmar Bergman (especially The Seventh Seal (1957), that includes the iconic scenes in which he plays chess with Death) made him well-known internationally, and he started to get offers from abroad. His career abroad began with him playing Jesus in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965); Hawaii (1966) and The Quiller Memorandum (1966). Since then, his career includes very different kind of characters, like Karl Oskar Nilsson in The Emigrants (1971); Father Lankester Merrin in The Exorcist (1973); Joubert the assassin in Three Days of the Condor (1975), Emperor Ming in Flash Gordon (1980); the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the Never Say Never Again (1983); Liet-Kynes in Dune (1984) the artist Frederick in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986); Lassefar in Pelle the Conqueror (1987), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination; Dr. Peter Ingham in Awakenings (1990); Lamar Burgess in Minority Report (2002) and The Renter in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), which earned him his second Academy Award nomination. He has become one of Sweden's most admired and professional actors and is the only male Swedish actor to receive an Oscar nomination. Max has been nominated twice: for Pelle the Conqueror (1987) in 1988 and for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) in 2012. He received the Guldbagge Award for Best Director in his directing debut, the drama film Katinka (1988).
