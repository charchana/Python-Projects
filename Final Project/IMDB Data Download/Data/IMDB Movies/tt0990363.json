He presided over an acting family that included brothers Keith Carradine and Robert Carradine as well as his daughters Calista Carradine and Kansas Carradine, and nieces Ever Carradine and Martha Plimpton. He was born in Hollywood and educated at San Francisco State College, where he studied music theory and composition. It was while writing music for the Drama Department's annual revues that he discovered his own passion for the stage, joining a Shakespearean repertory company and learning his craft on his feet. After a two-year stint in the army, he found work in New York as a commercial artist and later found fame on Broadway in \"The Deputy\" and \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\" opposite Christopher Plummer. With that experience he returned to Hollywood, landing the lead in the short-lived TV series Shane (1966) before being tapped to star opposite Barbara Hershey in Martin Scorsese's first Hollywood film, Boxcar Bertha (1972). The iconic Kung Fu (1972) followed, catapulting Carradine to superstardom for the next three years, until he left the series to pursue his film career. That career included more than 100 feature films, a couple of dozen television movies, a whole range of theater on and off Broadway and another hit series, Kung Fu: The Legend Continues (1992). Carradine received the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Film Review as well as a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of Woody Guthrie in Hal Ashby's Bound for Glory (1976), and he won critical acclaim for his work as Cole Younger in The Long Riders (1980). \"Kung Fu\" also received seven Emmy nominations in its first season, including one for Carradine as Best Actor. In addition, he won the People's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival's \"Director's Fortnight\" for his work on Americana (1981), and a second Golden Globe nomination for his supporting role in North and South (1985). Among his other notable film credits were Gray Lady Down (1978), Mean Streets (1973), Bird on a Wire (1990), The Long Goodbye (1973), The Serpent's Egg (1977) and Circle of Iron (1978). He returned to the screen in what could be his greatest performance, playing the title role in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), for which he received his fourth Golden Globe nomination. He also continued his devotion to music, and recorded some 60 tracks in various musical genres and sang in several movies. He made his home in Los Angeles with his fifth wife Annie, her four children and their two dogs. Found dead after a strangulation/masturbation session went wrong in Bangkok, Thailand, on June 3, 2009, aged 72.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MDM1NjcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzUwMDIz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001016","name":"David Carradine","nicknames":["Mr. Cool"],"idIMDB":"nm0001016"},"actorId":"nm0001016","character":"Principal Hoskins","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Zelda Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931958","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NzM5MTYxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIxOTAyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 July 1989","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Zelda Rae Williams","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Zelda Williams was born on July 31, 1989 in New York City, New York, USA as Zelda Rae Williams.

Her years at the conservatory laid the foundation that would lead to a love and respect of the fundamentals of theater. Originally known for being a pin up model and music video vixen, appearing first in Playboy's College girl issue, then appearing in videos for Kid Rock, Dr. Dre, Shaggy, Sugar Ray, Ja Rule, Velvet Revolver, No Doubt, Wyclef Jean, Enrique Iglesias, Nas, Third Eye Blind, Lil Kim, Blink 182, Chief Wakil, Limp Biszket, Saliva, and George Michael. The transition to film and television came with her debut as Cherry in the comedy film TomCats, followed by her series regular role on the Comedy Central series The Man Show staring Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla. Shortly after a 5 episode run as the On The Red Carpet correspondent for ShowTime, an offer came to join Robin Antin's original Pussycat Dolls live at the Viper Room. This opportunity would change her life forever. After years of working the showgirl circuit before coming to Hollywood, burlesque became second nature to Rachel. It was a dream come true becoming the Dolls burlesque solo artist. Her performance in the bath tube and Champagne glass have been often imitated but never duplicated. Under Jimmy Iovine at Interscope Records, The Pussycat Dolls transformed from a burlesque revue to pop girl band group originally having 12 members including Carmen Electra. The opportunity to appear in a small role in The Wedding Crashers along side Vince Vaughn would guide Rachel back to her original path toward acting. Rachel would leave the Dolls to pursue acting. Returning years later for 6 months as the Headliner at The Pussycat Doll Lounge at Caesars Palace. The success of The Wedding Crashers coupled with the notoriety of being an original Pussycat Doll landed Magazine features and covers globally for Maxim, FHM, Stuff, Esquire, Front, Frank 151, and in various photography art books. Most notable is her work with Ellen Von Unwerth, Nick & Adam Hayes as well as close friends Estevon Oriol, Patrick Hoelck, and Scott Cann. During this time Rachel toured America and Canada as the burlesque headliner coupled with famous DJs at numerous nightclubs, theaters, events and even Hugh Hefner's famous Playboy Mansion. After honing her improv chops at Upright Citizens Brigade, Rachel quickly found a place on The Carpet Brothers along side Will Ferrell as Bianca Jaguar, and as Madam Caramel for 2 seasons on Reno 911. It was this role that got Hugh Hefner's attention and the celebrity pictorial for Playboy Magazine. Proving once and for all that personality counts. Her time studying at the John Rosenfeld Studios was time well spent and, soon after, landed her television roles on Wilfred, How I Met Your Mother, Entourage, Workaholics, House MD, True Blood & 90210. Rachel also makes a cameo along side Chelsea Handler in Fun Size and makes her debut into the horror world in indie film The No Vacancy. This past year Rachel not only posed images with photographer Tibor Glob for clothing companies Want My Look and Stephanie Costello couture, but made a cameo on Australia's Dancing With The Stars with her partner Damian Whitewood ,as well and landing an invitation to appear on NBC's Truth Be Told staring Vanessa Lachey, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Bresha Webb, and comedian Tone Bell.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzlmOWIyZDktMzJlOC00NzUwLTgyMjctNjI0NTZjYjJjMzllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjYxNjM4NDA@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1043494","name":"Rachel Sterling","nicknames":["Rachie Rach"],"idIMDB":"nm1043494"},"actorId":"nm1043494","character":"Mimi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shel Rasten","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2407671","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNmYzNlYzYtODdjNS00NzAzLTg2YTUtMzQ0ZGY1YjUwZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQxOTE4MzU@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Shel Rasten is an actor and producer, known for Audition (2011), Detention (2010) and FAMOUS (And on the List) (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNmYzNlYzYtODdjNS00NzAzLTg2YTUtMzQ0ZGY1YjUwZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQxOTE4MzU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2407671","name":"Shel Rasten","idIMDB":"nm2407671"},"actorId":"nm2407671","character":"Jack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeremy Luke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1157053","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTVlZmIwMDgtMTE3NC00YmIwLTk5YjMtMzczMTFmZTZmODRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2NjkyMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 March 1978","placeOfBirth":" Staten Island, New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Jeremy Luke was born and raised in South Beach, Staten Island.
