Since appearing in Ed Gass-Donnelly's \"This Beautiful City\" at TIFF '08 (a role that garnered him ACTRA's Award for Best Actor and another Canadian Academy nomination), his work has received much acclaim. With roles that include two seasons in BBC America and Tom Fontana's \"Copper\"; starring in and producing Christopher MacBride's cult hit, \"The Conspiracy\"; and leading opposite both Donald and Kiefer Sutherland in \"Forsaken\", Aaron's opportunities have just begun to expand outside Canada.

He studied acting at the Actor's Studio in Montreal. Dennis has brought his linguistic versatility to many productions across Canada. He has premièred roles by some of the country's finest writers, including Michel Tremblay, John Murrell, George F. Walker, David Fennario and Daniel MacIvor. He has also played the über-everyman on television, film and stage, and his fair share of bumbling cops. A character actor, O'Connor finds artistic challenges mostly on the stage. His classical roles have included Tartuffe for Théâtre français de Toronto, and Falstaff in an indie production of Henry IV, Part One for the past several summers, he has played Leopold Bloom in the James Joyce ''Ulysses'' / Bloomsday celebrations in Toronto; roles which require great verbal and emotional dexterity. He is most notably remembered for his role as Gaston Talbot in Larry Tremblay's The Dragonfly of Chicoutimi. He created the English language première of Michel Tremblay's Narrator in For the Pleasure of Seeing Her Again (Encore une fois, si vous le permettez). In 2010, he will perform in disguise room, a solo piece written for him by e. schuhe, for SeeshoplaytrickS, in Berlin, Germany. He is a veteran of over three hundred radio dramas for CBC / Radio-Canada. O'Connor has had 4 Best Actor nominations for Toronto's Dora Awards.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640297","name":"Dennis O'Connor","idIMDB":"nm0640297"},"actorId":"nm0640297","character":"Robert Williams","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0492803","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2330322","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2330322","business":{"budget":{"money":"$CAD1,200,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 24 min (84 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":["Canon 7D (Tie clip cameras)","Red One Camera"],"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.3","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Toronto, Ontario, Canada"}],"rated":"NOT RATED","awards":[{"award":"Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival 2012","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Best North American Independent Film","categories":[{"category":"","names":[{"name":"Christopher MacBride","id":"nm2804532","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"7,602","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0191649","name":"Resolute Films and Entertainment"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["conspiracy","secret society","manhunt","human prey","found footage","detective","mysterious disappearance","husband wife relationship","surprise ending"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 04:34:53"}}
