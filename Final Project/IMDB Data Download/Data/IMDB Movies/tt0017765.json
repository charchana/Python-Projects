They had three children, Cricket (b. 1906), Evelyn (b. 1914) and Marian (b. 1917). The three girls were all put into films; in the late 1920s, Universal made a series of two reelers with the entire family based upon a theatrical family with three daughters. Edwards was earning $5,000 a week by then. Cricket became a secretary for the Jaffe Agency and married famous L.A. attorney Newt Kendall. She later became a movie producer and worked on films like The Guns of Navarone (1961) and The Victors (1963). Marian became an actress and later married writer Irwin Shaw (Rich Man, Poor Man (1976)). Evelyn was a writer who worked for RKO for years. Edwards' final film was the 1931 classic The Public Enemy (1931) but, by then, he was very sick with cirrhosis of the liver and rheumatoid arthritis. He is in a number of early scenes as \"Putty Nose\", but was unable to finish filming. He spent his final years bedridden, passing away in 1937 at home.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0250366","name":"Snitz Edwards","idIMDB":"nm0250366"},"actorId":"nm0250366","character":"The Dean","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Carl Harbaugh","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0361882","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 November 1886","placeOfBirth":" Washington, District of Columbia, USA","birthName":"Carl Lee Harbaugh","bio":"Carl Harbaugh was born on November 10, 1886 in Washington, District of Columbia, USA as Carl Lee Harbaugh.

Audiences took delight in her talents as an impressionist of well-known stage actresses of the time such as Marie Dressler. Florence was a full-fledged professional by the time she hooked up with Vitagraph Studios in 1906 as a wardrobe mistress/cashier/actress. Making her film debut in Cast Up by the Sea (1907), Turner was prominently displayed in front of the camera within a short period of time. Appearing in the company's more quality pieces, she formed a sturdy pairing with Maurice Costello and other matinée idols of the day. The diminutive, forlorn-looking performer eventually tested the acting waters in London in 1913, and was directed frequently by long-time friend Lawrence Trimble, occasionally collaborating on screenplays. She also contributed to her livelihood making appearances in music halls, still amazing audiences with her impersonations of everybody from Alla Nazimova to Charles Chaplin. She organized her own production company, Turner Films, and made more than 30 shorts, becoming the first star of the screen to take on producing chores. In 1915 she was the top box-office star. Florence maintained a highly visible transatlantic career for nearly a decade while appearing both here and in England in everything from classic Shakespeare (The Merchant of Venice (1908), Richard III (1908)) and historical epics (A Tale of Two Cities (1911), The Deerslayer (1913)) to classic drama (Far from the Madding Crowd (1915), Through the Valley of Shadows (1914), My Old Dutch (1915)). Her career started slipping after WWI, however, and by 1924 she was forced to settle permanently in Hollywood when the British film market dried up completely. At this point she had to make do as a stock player for MGM. The advent of sound was the final nail in her career's coffin, unfortunately. It was a respectful MGM that kept her on the payroll for the next decade, albeit in bit parts and extra roles. She died practically forgotten at the Woodland Hills, California, Motion Picture Country Home in 1946 at age 61.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWU2N2QxNDAtMjcwNi00ZTUxLThiYTgtMjQwNTZiMWQwY2ZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0877550","name":"Florence Turner","nicknames":["The Vitagraph Girl","Flotie"],"idIMDB":"nm0877550"},"actorId":"nm0877550","character":"A Mother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Buster Keaton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000036","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MjA4ODk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQyNjI2._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 October 1895","placeOfBirth":" Piqua, Kansas, USA","birthName":"Joseph Frank Keaton","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"When at six months of age he tumbled down a flight of stairs unharmed, he was given the name \"Buster\" by Harry Houdini who, along with W.C. Fields, Bill Robinson (\"Bojangles\"), Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson shared headlines with \"The Three Keatons\": Buster, his father Joe Keaton and mother Myra Keaton. Their act, one of the most dangerous in vaudeville, was about how to discipline a prankster child. Buster was thrown all over the stage and even into the audience. No matter what the stunt, he was poker-faced. By the time Buster turned 21, however, his father was such a severe alcoholic that the stunts became too dangerous to perform and the act dissolved. He first saw a movie studio in March 1917 and, on April 23, his debut film, Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy (1917), was released. He stayed with Fatty through 15 two-reelers, even though he was offered much more to sign with Fox or Warner Bros. after returning from ten months with the U.S. Army (40th Infantry Division) in France. His first full-length feature, The Saphead (1920), established him as a star in his own right. By the middle of 1921 he had his own production company--Buster Keaton Productions--and was writing, directing and starring in his own films. With a small and close team around him, Keaton created some of the most beautiful and imaginative films of the silent era. The General (1926), his favorite, was one of the last films over which he had artistic control. In 1928 he reluctantly signed with MGM after his contract with independent producer Joseph M. Schenck expired. MGM quickly began to enforce its rigid, mechanized style of filmmaking on Keaton, swamping him with gag writers and scripts. He fought against it for a time, and the compromise was initially fruitful, his first film for MGM--The Cameraman (1928)--being one of his finest. However,with his creativity becoming increasingly stifled he began to drink excessively, despondent at having to perform material that was beneath him. Ironically, his films around 1930 were his most successful to date in terms of box-office receipts, which confirmed to MGM that its formula was right. His drinking led to a disregard for schedules and erratic behavior on the MGM lot, and a disastrous confrontation with Louis B. Mayer resulted in him being fired. The diplomatic producer Irving Thalberg attempted to smooth things over but Keaton was past caring. By 1932 he was a divorced alcoholic, getting work where he could, mostly in short comedies. In 1935 he entered a mental hospital. MGM rehired him in 1937 as a $100-a-week gag writer (his salary ten years before was more than ten times this amount). The occasional film was a boost to this steady income. In 1947 his career rebounded with a live appearance at Cirque Medrano in Paris. In 1952 James Mason, who then owned Keaton's Hollywood mansion, found a secret store of presumably lost nitrate stock of many of Buster's early films; film historian and archivist Raymond Rohauer began a serious collection/preservation of Buster's work. In 1957 Buster appeared with Charles Chaplin in Limelight (1952) and his film biography, The Buster Keaton Story (1957), was released. Two years later he received a special Oscar for his life work in comedy, and he began to receive the accolades he so richly deserved, with festivals around the world honoring his work. He died in 1966, age 70.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MjA4ODk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQyNjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000036","name":"Buster Keaton","nicknames":["The Great Stone Face","Malec"],"idIMDB":"nm0000036"},"actorId":"nm0000036","character":"A Son","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0017765","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017765","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"€23,993","country":"Spain","day":"31","month":"08","year":"2002","remarks":""},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/2002/\">2002</a>"}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 6 min (66 min) (USA)"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["1,716 m (Yugoslavia)","1,803.2 m (6 reels)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.1","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Los Angeles City College - 855 North Vermont Avenue, Los Angeles, California, USA"}],"rated":"NOT RATED","awards":[{"award":"Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA 2013","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Saturn Award","categories":[{"category":"Best DVD/Blu-Ray Collection","names":[{"name":"Steamboat Bill, Jr.","id":"tt0019421","role":null},{"name":"The General","id":"tt0017925","role":null},{"name":"Seven Chances","id":"tt0016332","role":null},{"name":"The Saphead","id":"tt0011652","role":null},{"name":"Our Hospitality","id":"tt0014341","role":null},{"name":"The Navigator","id":"tt0015163","role":null},{"name":"Three Ages","id":"tt0014538","role":null},{"name":"Go West","id":"tt0015863","role":null},{"name":"Battling Butler","id":"tt0016630","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"3,385","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0000357","name":"Joseph M.
