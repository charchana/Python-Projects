She then studied at the Conservatoire d'Art Dramatique and followed an illustrious theatrical career, which includes Ivan Turgenev's \"A Month in the Country\", Euripides' \"Medea\" (title role) etc. She made her movie debut in 1971 and soon became one of the top actresses of her generation, giving fine performances in important films, like Claude Goretta's The Lacemaker (1977), as a simple-minded girl who falls in love with - and is betrayed by - a student, Jean-Luc Godard's Every Man for Himself (1980), as a prostitute, and Maurice Pialat's Loulou (1980), as an upper-class woman who is physically attracted by a young vagabond. She made her US debut playing a brothel madam in Michael Cimino's disastrous Heaven's Gate (1980) and has an extremely productive collaboration with Claude Chabrol, who cast her in several movies, including Violette (1978), in which she played a young woman who murders her parents, and Story of Women (1988), in which she gave an excellent performance as a shameless abortionist, the last woman to be executed in France.

Law has been nominated for two Academy Awards and continues to build a prolific body of work that spans from early successes such as Gattaca (1997) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) to more recent turns as Dr. John Watson in Sherlock Holmes (2009) and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), as Hugo's father in Hugo (2011) and in the titular role in Dom Hemingway (2013). David Jude Law was born on December 29, 1972 in Lewisham, London, England, to Margaret Anne (Heyworth) and Peter Robert Law, both of whom taught at comprehensive schools; his father later became a headmaster. Law has said that he was named after both the book Jude the Obscure and the song Hey Jude. In 1992, Jude began his stage career. He starred in many plays throughout London, and was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award of \"Outstanding Newcomer\" After doing the play \"Indiscretions\" in London, he moved and did it again on Broadway. This time, he was alongside Kathleen Turner. He then received a Tony Nomination for \"Outstanding Supporting Actor\". He was then rewarded the Theatre World Award. After Broadway, Jude started on the big screen, in many independent films. His first big-named movie was Gattaca (1997), with Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke. He also had a good role in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997). Jude's latest rise to fame has been because of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), in which he plays Matt Damon's obsession. The film did very well at the box office, and critics loved Jude's acting. Following the success of Gattaca (1997) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Law's feature film career continued to gain momentum throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s with roles in such films as Enemy at the Gates (2001), Road to Perdition (2002), I Heart Huckabees (2004), Aviator (2004) and many others. Law is one of three actors, along with Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp, to take over acting responsibilities in the Terry Gilliam project The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) following Heath Ledger's death. Law is a partner in the production company \"Natural Nylon\". His partners include Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan McGregor and his ex-wife Sadie Frost. Law has been active in many charitable activities and supports several different foundations and causes, doing work for organizations including the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Make Poverty History, Breast Cancer Care and others. Law is also a peace advocate, and in 2011, participated in street protests against the rule of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus. Law married Sadie Frost in 1997 and the couple had two sons (Rafferty and Rudy) and a daughter (Iris) before divorcing in 2003. Law and Alfie (2004) co-star Sienna Miller were engaged to be married in 2005 and separated in 2006 (they would later rekindle their relationship in 2009, splitting once again in 2011). Law and American model Samantha Burke had a brief relationship in 2008 that resulted in the birth of Law's fourth child, daughter Sophia.

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for The Departed (2006) who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in The Fighter (2010), Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in Ted (2012). Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Irish, Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), and more distant French-Canadian, English, and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own problems. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age 14 (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances himself. The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him. Around this time, his older brother Donnie Wahlberg had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band New Kids on the Block. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love. Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer David Geffen saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer Calvin Klein, Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model. His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the New Kids on the Block's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark's\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with Madonna and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper Shabba Ranks, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts. Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in Penny Marshall's Renaissance Man (1994). Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In Renaissance Man (1994), he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial The Basketball Diaries (1995) and chilled them in Fear (1996) as every father's worst nightmare. The major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997). Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as Three Kings (1999) and The Perfect Storm (2000), popcorn flicks like Planet of the Apes (2001) and Contraband (2012), and even indies such as I Heart Huckabees (2004). Wahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as Boardwalk Empire (2010), In Treatment (2008) and the highly successful comedy Entourage (2004), which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood. Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham have four children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MjYwNTE2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTI0NjI1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242","name":"Mark Wahlberg","nicknames":["Marky Mark","Monk D"],"idIMDB":"nm0000242"},"actorId":"nm0000242","character":"Tommy Corn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011119","main":true},{"actorName":"Naomi Watts","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915208","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY1NTA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk3MDYwOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 September 1968","placeOfBirth":" Shoreham, Kent, England, UK","birthName":"Naomi Ellen Watts","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Naomi Ellen Watts was born on September 28, 1968 in Shoreham, England, to Myfanwy Edwards \"Miv\" (Roberts), an antiques dealer and costume/set designer, and Peter Watts (Peter Anthony Watts), the road manager to Pink Floyd. Her maternal grandfather was Welsh. Her father died when Naomi was seven and she began to follow her mother and her brother around England, until she was fourteen, when they settled in Australia, where her maternal grandmother was from. She coaxed her mother into letting her take acting class when they arrived. After bit parts in commercials, she landed her first role in For Love Alone (1986). Naomi met her best friend, Nicole Kidman, when they both auditioned for a bikini commercial and they shared a taxi ride home. In 1991, Naomi starred along Kidman in the sleeper-hit Flirting (1991) directed by John Duigan. Naomi continued her career by starring in the Australian Brides of Christ (1991) co-starring Oscar-winners Russell Crowe and Brenda Fricker. In 1993, she worked with John Duigan again in Wide Sargasso Sea (1993) and director George Miller in Gross Misconduct (1993). Tank Girl (1995), in 1995, an adaptation of the comic book was a cult hit, starred Naomi as \"Jet Girl\", but it didn't fare well at the box-office and didn't do much for her career as a whole. Watts continued to take insignificant parts in movies including the much forgotten film Children of the Corn: The Gathering (1996). It wasn't until David Lynch cast her in the critically acclaimed film Mulholland Drive (2001) that she began to become noticed. Her part as an aspiring actress showed her strong acting ability and wide range and earned her much respect, as much as to say by some that she was overlooked for a Oscar nomination that year. Stardom finally came to Naomi in the surprise hit The Ring (2002), which grossed over $100,000,000 at the box-office and starred Watts as a investigative reporter hunting down the truth behind several mysterious deaths seemingly caused by a video tape. While the movie did not fare well with the critics, it launched her into the spotlight. In 2003, she starred in Alejandro González Iñárritu's 21 Grams (2003) which earned her - what some say is a much overdue Oscar nomination and brought others to call her one of the best in her generation of actors. The same year, she was nominated for 21 Grams (2003), Naomi was chosen to play \"Ann Darrow\" in director Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) which took her to New Zealand for a five month shoot. Watts completed her first comedy in I Heart Huckabees (2004) for director David O. Russell, playing a superficial spokes model - a break from her usual intense and dramatic roles she is known for. In 2005, she reprized her role as the protective-mother-reporter \"Rachel Keller\" in The Ring Two (2005). The movie, released in March, opened to $35,000,000 at the box office in the first weekend and established her as a box-office draw. Also in 2005, it was decided that her independent movie Ellie Parker (2001) would be re-released in late 2005 after its success at resurfacing at the Sundance Film Festival. The movie, which Naomi also produced, features her in the title role and is a bit biographical, but yet exaggerated take of the life of a struggling actress as she comes to Hollywood and encounters nightmares of the profession (it also features Watts' own beat-up Honda which she travels around in). In 2006, she starred with Edward Norton in Le voile des illusions (2006). In July of 2007, Naomi gave birth to a boy, Alexander Pete (Sasha Schreiber) in Los Angeles with Liev Schreiber. Since then her career choices have gathered even more critical acclaim with starring roles roles in German director Michael Haneke's American remake of his thriller Funny Games (2007), David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises (2007), and the action-thriller, The International (2009), released in February 2009. In mid-2008, Watts announced she was expecting her second child with Schreiber and gave birth to another boy, Samuel Kai Schreiber, in New York on December 13.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY1NTA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk3MDYwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915208","name":"Naomi Watts","nicknames":["Queen of Remakes"],"idIMDB":"nm0915208"},"actorId":"nm0915208","character":"Dawn Campbell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011120","main":true},{"actorName":"Angela Grillo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342018","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Angela Grillo is known for her work on I Heart Huckabees (2004), Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) and Spanking the Monkey (1994).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342018","name":"Angela Grillo","idIMDB":"nm0342018"},"actorId":"nm0342018","character":"Angela Franco","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0244043","main":true},{"actorName":"Ger Duany","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1563346","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDU4ODk5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxNTgyMDI@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Ger Duany was born in Akobo, South Sudan.

He grew up in a traditional Latino Catholic family, and is of Irish and Mexican descent. Bray, who began fighting at a very early age, has over 30 year's of amateur and professional boxing experience. He helped start The John Bray Boxing Foundation with his brother, who was on the Olympic Boxing Team with Oscar de la Hoya, the charity helps children off the street and away from drugs and violence. Ben was discovered at the age of 21 while training at a local boxing gym, soon after he decided to pursue a career in stunts and acting, and while training to be an all around Stuntman he was accepted into Lee Strasberg's Actors studio and The Rick Walters Theatre Company. After a series of high profile movies, Bray met 'Three King's director David O. Russell on set and immediately became very close friends. Through David he was introduced to Director Joe Carnahan. Both Directors convinced Bray that he could cross over as a triple threat... a serious actor, stunt coordinator and a director. Now as an award winning actor and stunt coordinator Bray has been nominated for two Taurus Awards, Best Wire Work for 'Swordfish' starring John Travolta and Best Action Film for 'The A-Team' starring Liam Neeson. He won his first award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture for Star Trek and was nominated that same year for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Bray has also taught some of Hollywood's A list actors how to fight including Academy Award Winner Christian Bale (The Fighter), Tobey Maguire (Spiderman 2), and Lou Diamond Phillips (Courage Under Fire) and has taken many a punch for Javier Bardem as his double in the Oscar winning movie 'No Country for Old Men.' Expanding his talents further in the film industry, Bray was the Second Unit director for 'Smoking Aces' (Ryan Reynolds, Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck), 'The Grey' (Liam Neeson, Frank Grillo, Dermot Mulroney) and the upcoming film 'Silver Linings Playbook' (Bradley Cooper, Robert De Nero). Aside from his extensive film credits as an actor and stunt coordinator, Bray has guest starred in the hit TV shows 'Breaking Bad', 'CSI Miami', 'Sons of Anarchy' and on the Emmy Award Winning show 'The Shield' opposite Michael Chiklis. With an impressive 100+ film and TV credits as an actor and stunt coordinator, Bray continues his craft of acting in the new Oliver Stone movie 'Savages', where he plays a drug cartel opposite Oscar winning actor Benicio del Toro.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NjM4OTc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkyMTgzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004554","name":"Ben Hernandez Bray","idIMDB":"nm0004554"},"actorId":"nm0004554","character":"Davy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Appel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0032219","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0ODk3ODI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyMTMxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 May 1963","placeOfBirth":" New York, USA","birthName":"Richard James Appel","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Richard Appel was born on May 21, 1963 in New York, USA as Richard James Appel.
