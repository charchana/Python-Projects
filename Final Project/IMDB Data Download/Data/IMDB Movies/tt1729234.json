His debut in films came in 1947 with The Smugglers (1947). His talents came to the forefront in the animated feature Animal Farm (1954), in which he voiced all of the animal characters. A prolific actor, his familiar sharp features and bald head appeared in dozens of films over the following years, often as charming but slightly \"balmy\" characters and well-bred cads, although he was more than capable of playing straight drama, as he did in the war picture Sink the Bismarck! (1960) as a naval officer helping to hunt down and sink the German battleship. He began appearing regularly in television in the 1970s and also worked steadily on the stage. He died of natural causes at age 92 in London, England.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219062","name":"Maurice Denham","idIMDB":"nm0219062"},"actorId":"nm0219062","character":"Theo Gaunt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Carson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141264","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3ODg5NjUxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ1MzUyMjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 February 1927","placeOfBirth":" Colombo, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]","birthName":"John Derek Carson-Parker","bio":"John Carson was a hugely prolific actor who appeared constantly on UK screens throughout the mid-50s until the mid-80s. He has appeared alongside many of the UK's stars and became hugely popular as a villain or hero. The secret of John's success was his versatility and his wonderful silky voice. He appeared in 3 Hammer films which led to an ever-increased popularity amongst film fans. John moved to South Africa from England in the 80s and, sadly, his appearances became far more sporadic although he always kept working, even producing and filming his own short documentary, \"African Spirit\". He the returned to England in 2007 and has been involved in a few films, such as The Deal (2008). He attended a John Carson Celebration Day in London (July 2009). This was the first time he had talked publicly about his long career in television, film and stage. The day was a huge success and, aside from a showing of two of his films, John gave an interview on stage and then signed autographs. The day was a huge success and this was proved so by a large attendance and the queues for his autograph and photos. John returned to South Africa in 2014 where he spent time with his family and got to relax a little. He sadly passed away on November 5th, 2016, he was a fine actor and leaves behind a legacy of his versatility on screen.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3ODg5NjUxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ1MzUyMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141264","name":"John Carson","idIMDB":"nm0141264"},"actorId":"nm0141264","character":"Insp.

Lean, pale-eyed and of deceptively mild intonation, he was capable of unnervingly icy composure, never more effectively displayed than as the chameleon-like Soviet mole Kim Philby in ITV's telemovie Philby, Burgess and Maclean (1977). In similar vein, Bate played the enigmatic, debonair American-born spook, Bret Renssalaer, in Len Deighton's Game, Set, and Match (1988). Most famously, he added an authentic touch to the affable, officious Home Office security undersecretary, Sir Oliver Lacon -- \"Whitehall's Head Prefect\" - in John le Carré's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), and its sequel, Smiley's People (1982). Anthony Bate began working life behind the bar of a hotel owned by his family on the Isle of Wight. After completing his national service with the Royal Navy Volunteers in 1947, he started dabbling in amateur dramatics and then took the next step to formal training at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, graduating a gold medal winner. After the obligatory sojourn in repertory theatre, he made his West End debut in a 1960 dramatisation of the famous 1925 Scopes Trial, \"Inherit the Wind\", at St. Martin's Theatre. Over the next three decades, he drew many excellent notices for such classical roles as Don Pedro in \"Much Ado About Nothing\", for the Royal Shakespeare Company. In occasional films from 1957, Bate popped up as straight man in minor comedies, like Dentist in the Chair (1960). However, in due course, he found his niche to be on the small screen, where he was increasingly sought-after by producers for a wide variety of characters of, either, furtive, stern, starchy, supercilious or sinister disposition. Besides crime and espionage, Bate was a ubiquitous protagonist in screen adaptations from the classics: the obsessive Inspector Javert on the trail of Frank Finlay's Jean Valjeon, in a 1967 version of Victor Hugo's oft-filmed masterpiece; as the intrepid Dr. Livesey of Treasure Island (1977); and as the Knight's Templar, Sir Brian de Bois Guilbert, chief nemesis of Ivanhoe (1970). Another of his outright villains was treacherous London gangster Eddie Edwards, taking advantage of his boss's (Ray McAnally) incarceration to usurp his criminal empire. In Intimate Strangers (1974), Bate was given a rare starring role, as a middle-aged family man, re-evaluating his life after a heart attack. This introspective and nuanced performance was, arguably, one of his best. The cool, unflappable Mr. Bate also portrayed such historical personae as Joseph Stalin, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt and Eduard Shevardnadze -- all with equal vigour and conviction. One of the unsung heroes of British television, Anthony Bate passed away in June 2012 at the age of 84.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0060766","name":"Anthony Bate","idIMDB":"nm0060766"},"actorId":"nm0060766","character":"Ray Underwood","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Arnatt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0036031","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 May 1917","placeOfBirth":" Petrograd [now St. Petersburg], Russia","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"John Edwin Arnatt was born in Petrograd on the eve of the Russian Revolution, the son of a manager for Vauxhall Motors. Forced to leave Russia during the turmoil, his family returned to England where John was schooled at Epworth College and later trained for acting at RADA. On stage from 1936, he made his debut at the London West End in 1938 (in the revue \"Happy Returns\"). He resumed his theatrical career following wartime army service, even enjoying a brief stint as a stand-up comic at the Windmill Theatre. During the 1950's, he appeared in plays by Shakespeare and Chekhov at the Arts Theatre Club and at the Old Vic (both in London and in Bristol), as well as doubling up reporting sports on commercial television under the nom de plume 'Howard Peters'. A tall man with urbane manners, a no-nonsense attitude, often sporting a pencil moustache, Arnatt is best remembered for his many impersonations on screen of thoughtful, pipe-smoking authority figures: Scotland Yard inspectors, commissioners, diplomats, aristocrats and army officers. In Doctor Who (1963) (\"The Invasion of Time\"), he played the Time Lord Borusa, one-time Lord Chancellor of Gallifrey. He was, perhaps, most effectively employed as deputy sheriff (temporarily replacing Alan Wheatley) or as the high sheriff of Nottingham in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1955), a worthy antagonist to Richard Greene.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0036031","name":"John Arnatt","idIMDB":"nm0036031"},"actorId":"nm0036031","character":"Supt.
