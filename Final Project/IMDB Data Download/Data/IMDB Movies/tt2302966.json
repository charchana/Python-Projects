Alfred graduated from UCLA with a major in Economics, specialization in Computing, and a minor in East Asian Languages. Throughout college Alfred also took UCLA's theater classes.

In 2009 Alfred made a life changing decision by quitting his job to train full-time for the World Wushu Championships. This decision paid off as he brought home the first US men's gold medal in wushu history. While working for Jet Li, Alfred was involved in acting, action choreography, producing, and philanthropy. In 2010 Alfred appeared opposite Jet Li acting as one of his disciples in The Sorcerer and the White Snake.
