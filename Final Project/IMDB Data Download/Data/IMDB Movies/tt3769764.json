She was born Svetlana Viktorovna Khodchenkova on January 21, 1983, in Moscow and spent her childhood in Zheleznodorozhny, a small city about 6 miles east of Moscow, Russia. She was raised by a single mother, attended a public school, and once dreamed of becoming a medical doctor. In 1998, at the age of 15, she started a career as a fashion model in Moscow, and also made a few international gigs. In 2000 she began her studies at the Moscow Institute of World Economics, but quit in favor of acting. From 2001 to 2005 she studied acting at the Shchukin Theatrical School of the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow. There she attended the class of Nina Doroshina and Alekandr Lyubimtsev, graduating in 2005 as actress. While a student, she starred in films of directors Stanislav Govorukhin, and Viktor Merezhko, and also appeared in popular Russian TV series. In 2008, she earned the best actress award at Gdynya Polish Film Festival, for the leading role in Mala Moskwa (2008). In 2012, she won COFCA Award for La taupe (2011). On December 13, 2005, she married her classmate, actor Vladimir Yaglych, and also took her husband's name, changing her name from Svetlana Khodchenkova to Svetlana Yaglych.The couple married on the 13th on purpose; because all their filming contracts were signed on the 13th, they believed that 13 would keep working as a good number for them. However, their marriage did not last, ending in divorce. Svetlana has been involved in several stage productions of Independent stage project in Moscow. She made stellar appearances in such plays, as \"Moulin Rouge Hospital\" and \"Theatre with and without rules\" earning herself much critical acclaim. Outside of her acting profession, Svetlana is skilled in horse-back riding. She is also fond of winter sports, such as alpine skiing: she practiced her downhill at the ski resort of Courchevel, France.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwODUwOTI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI0NzQyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1300303","name":"Svetlana Khodchenkova","idIMDB":"nm1300303"},"actorId":"nm1300303","character":" ","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jérôme Cusin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2879391","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jérôme Cusin is known for his work on Vasilisa (2014), Corps & âme (2007) and Hiatus (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2879391","name":"Jérôme Cusin","idIMDB":"nm2879391"},"actorId":"nm2879391","character":" Blier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kristina Kuzmina","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2060117","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kristina Kuzmina is an actress, known for Vasilisa (2014), Assassins Run (2013) and Volshebnik (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2060117","name":"Kristina Kuzmina","idIMDB":"nm2060117"},"actorId":"nm2060117","character":" ","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ilya Noskov","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1150280","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 July 1977","placeOfBirth":" Novaya Kahovka, Ukraine","birthName":"Ilya Anatilyevch Noskov","height":"6' 2¾\" (1.9 m)","bio":"The son of an engineer (Dad) and a nurse (Mom), Ilya attended the Academy of Theatrical Arts in St. Petersburg or Leningrad State Institute of Theatre, Music & Film) and is the brother of 'Andre Noskov'.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1150280","name":"Ilya Noskov","idIMDB":"nm1150280"},"actorId":"nm1150280","character":" ","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Aleksandr Aravushkin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4684906","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Aleksandr Aravushkin is known for his work on Guest (2013), Zhila-byla odna baba (2011) and Vasilisa (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4684906","name":"Aleksandr Aravushkin","idIMDB":"nm4684906"},"actorId":"nm4684906","character":" ","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Aleksey Barabash","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1068631","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Aleksey Barabash is an actor, known for Stalingrad (2013), Piter FM (2006) and L'arche russe (2002).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1068631","name":"Aleksey Barabash","idIMDB":"nm1068631"},"actorId":"nm1068631","character":" ","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Aleksandr Bolshakov","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0093294","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 October 1968","placeOfBirth":" Kotelnich, Kirov Oblast, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]","bio":"Aleksandr Bolshakov was born on October 15, 1968 in Kotelnich, Kirov Oblast, RSFSR, USSR.
