She is the daughter of acting coach Burton Eugene \"Burt\" Lane and nightclub singer/centerfold Colleen Farrington. Her parents' families were both from the state of Georgia. Diane was acting from a very young age and made her stage debut at the age of six. Her work in such acclaimed theater productions as \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Medea\" led to her being called to Hollywood. She was 13 when she was cast by director George Roy Hill in his wonderful 1979 film I love you, je t'aime (1979), opposite Sir Laurence Olivier. The film only did so-so commercially, but Olivier praised his young co-star, calling her the new Grace Kelly. After her well-received debut, Diane found herself on magazine covers all over the world, including \"Time\", which declared her the \"new young acting sensation\". However, things quietened down a bit when she found herself in such critical and financial flops as Touched by Love (1980), Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981), Movie Madness (1982), Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and, most unmemorably, Six Pack (1982), all of which failed to set her career on fire. She also made several TV movies during this period, but it was in 1983 that she finally began to fulfill the promise of stardom that had earlier been predicted for her. Acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola took note of Diane's appeal and cast her in two \"youth\"-oriented films based on S.E. Hinton novels. Indeed, Rumble Fish (1983) and The Outsiders (1983) have become cult classics and resulted in her getting a loyal fan base. The industry was now taking notice of Diane Lane, and she soon secured lead roles in three big-budget studio epics. She turned down the first, Splash (1984) (which was a surprise hit for Daryl Hannah). Unfortunately, the other two were critical and box-office bombs: Walter Hill's glossy rock 'n' roll fable Streets of Fire (1984) was not the huge summer success that many had thought it would be, and the massively troubled Coppola epic The Cotton Club (1984) co-starring Richard Gere was also a high-profile flop. The back-to-back failure of both of these films could have ended her career there and then -- but thankfully it didn't. Possibly \"burned out\" by the lambasting these films received and unhappy with the direction her career was taking, she \"retired\" from the film business at age 19, saying that she had forgotten what she had started acting for. She stayed away from the screen for the next three years. Ironically, the two films that were the main causes of her \"retirement\" have since grown in popularity, and \"Streets of Fire\" especially seems to have found the kind of audience it couldn't get when it was first released. The process of rebuilding her career was a slow and gradual one. First came the obscure and very sexy straight-to-video thriller Lady Beware (1987), followed by the critically acclaimed but little seen The Big Town (1987) with Matt Dillon and Tommy Lee Jones. In the former, Diane plays a very mysterious and sexy stripper and her memorable strip sequence is a highlight of the film. Despite her sexy new on-screen image, it wasn't until 1989's smash hit TV mini-series Lonesome Dove (1989) that Diane made another big impression on a sizable audience. Her performance in the hugely popular and critically acclaimed western epic as a vulnerable \"whore with a heart\" won her an Emmy nomination and much praise. Film producers were interested in her again. Another well-received TV production, Descending Angel (1990), was followed by smaller roles in major films like Richard Attenborough's Chaplin (1992) and Mike Binder's Indian Summer (1993), and larger parts in small independent films like My New Gun (1992), Vital Signs (1990) and Face à face (1992). Indeed, the latter two films co-starred her then-husband, Christopher Lambert, with whom she had a daughter named Eleanor. Diane was now re-established in Hollywood and started to appear in higher-profile co-starring roles in some big-budget, major movies like Walter Hill's Wild Bill (1995), the Sylvester Stallone actioner Judge Dredd (1995), the Robin Williams's comedy Jack (1996) and Murder at 1600 (1997) co-starring Wesley Snipes. However, all of these still did not quite make Diane a \"big-name star\" and, by 1997, she found herself, possibly by choice, back in smaller, personal projects. Her next role as a frustrated 1960s housewife in the independent hit Le choix d'une vie (1999) deservedly won her rave notices and, at last, gave her career the big lift it needed. The cute but tear-jerking comedy My Dog Skip (2000) also proved to be a small-scale success. However, it was the £330-million worldwide grossing blockbuster hit The Perfect Storm (2000) that finally made Diane Lane the household name that she always should have been. After the worldwide success of \"The Perfect Storm\", she was more in demand than ever. She played Leelee Sobieski's sinister junkie guardian in the slick thriller The Glass House (2001), and co-starred with Keanu Reeves in the #1 smash hit Hardball (2001). However, her greatest career moment was still to come with her lead role in the enormous critical and commercial hit Unfaithful (2002), in which she superbly portrayed Richard Gere's adulterous wife. Her performance won the respect of critics and audiences alike, as well as many awards and nominations including Best Actress Oscar and Golden Globe nominations. Her follow-up films including Under the Tuscan Sun (2003), Must Love Dogs (2005), Hollywoodland (2006), Secretariat (2010), and the blockbuster, Man of Steel (2013), were all received and her performances were highly praised. She won further Best Actress Golden Globe nominations for her roles in Under the Tuscan Sun (2003) and Cinema Verite (2011). She is very well regarded within the industry, adored by film fans, and has a credibility and quality that is all too rare today. Her immense talent at playing human and real characters, her \"drop dead gorgeous\" beauty and down-to-earth grittiness guarantees that she will stay on top, and she guarantee has already shown the kind of resilience that will keep her working for a long, long time.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4ODQ5NTgxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkwMDgyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000178","name":"Diane Lane","idIMDB":"nm0000178"},"actorId":"nm0000178","character":"Sarah","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017952","main":true},{"actorName":"John Cusack","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTAwMjYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxNTU1OA@@._V1._CR286,2,351,422_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 June 1966","placeOfBirth":" Evanston, Illinois, USA","birthName":"John Paul Cusack","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"John Cusack is, like most of his characters, an unconventional hero. Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John's siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago's Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall's geek brigade in Sixteen Candles (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like The Sure Thing (1985) and Better Off Dead... (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything... (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in The Grifters (1990). The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins' Actors' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack's high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime's first feature was the sharply written comedy Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film's financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack's next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case. Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby's popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he's so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He's also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn't reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTAwMjYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxNTU1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131","name":"John Cusack","nicknames":["Johnny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000131"},"actorId":"nm0000131","character":"Jake","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017951","main":true},{"actorName":"Elizabeth Perkins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001610","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MjQ3MDY5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI2MjgzNA@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 November 1960","placeOfBirth":" Queens, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Elizabeth Ann Perkins","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Elizabeth Ann Perkins was born on November 18, 1960, in the borough of Queens, New York, and was raised in Vermont. Her mother, Jo Williams, was a concert pianist and drug treatment counselor, and her father, James Perkins, was a businessman, farmer, and writer. She is of Greek and English descent. Perkins studied acting at Chicago's Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University for three years, then launched her professional career with a co-starring gig in the touring company of Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs (1986). Seasoned, she returned to New York in the spring of 1984 to make her Broadway debut as a replacement in the Simon play. As a stage actress, she has trod the boards with Playwrights Horizon, the Ensemble Studio, The New York Shakespeare Festival, and, back in Chcago, with the Steppenwolf Theater. She found time out to marry the Chicago actor Terry Kinney. Her first major film role was in the underwhelming screen adaptation of David Mamet's \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\" which was turned into a Rob Lowe/Demi Moore star vehicle retitled About Last Night... (1986). Perkins sparkled as the grown woman interested in Tom Hanks in Big (1988), but her career was spotty and she never gained the traction to bring her the stardom that seemed to be within her grasp. In 1991, Perkins starred with Kevin Bacon in He Said, She Said (1991) (thus giving her a Bacon Factor of exactly 1) but, sadly, for such a talented actress, her biggest box-office hit has proven to be The Flintstones (1994), in which she portrayed Wilma. Perkins made her television debut in For Their Own Good (1993), a 1993 TV movie based on the true story of a woman who underwent mandatory sterilization to work in a chemical plant. She starred in the NBC comedy series Battery Park (2000) produced by Gary David Goldberg (who recently directed her in Must Love Dogs (2005) in a supporting role to her good friend Diane Lane), and HBO's If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000). Her other TV work includes Babilônia 2000 (1999), Rescuers: Stories of Courage: Two Women (1997), and From the Earth to the Moon (1998) in an episode directed by Sally Field. Perkins divorced Kinney and now is married to the cinematographer Julio Macat. Recently, she starred in John Patrick Shanley's black comedy \"Four Dogs and a Bone\" at Los Angeles' Geffen Playhouse. She also has a starring role in the series Weeds (2005) for Showtime. Her talent, personality, and good looks keep her steadily employed, and it wouldn't be surprising if now, on the other side of 40, she makes a breakthrough and does some major work commensurate with her early promise.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MjQ3MDY5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI2MjgzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001610","name":"Elizabeth Perkins","idIMDB":"nm0001610"},"actorId":"nm0001610","character":"Carol","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017953","main":true},{"actorName":"Christopher Plummer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001626","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MzQ5MDY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxOTU5Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1929","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Arthur Christopher Orme Plummer","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Arthur Christopher Orme Plummer was born in Toronto, Ontario. He is the only child of Isabella Mary (Abbott), a secretary to the Dean of Sciences at McGill University, and John Orme Plummer, who sold securities and stocks. He is a great-grandson of John Abbott, who was Canada's third Prime Minister (from 1891 to 1892), and a great-great-great-grandson of Anglican clergyman John Bethune. He has Scottish, English, and Anglo-Irish ancestry. Plummer was raised in Senneville, Quebec, by Montreal. Until the 2009 Academy Awards were announced, it could be said about Plummer that he was the finest actor of the post-World War II period to fail to get an Academy Award. In that, he was following in the footsteps of the late great John Barrymore, whom Plummer so memorably portrayed on Broadway in a one-man show that brought him his second Tony Award. In 2010, Plummer finally got an Oscar nod for his portrayal of another legend, Leo Tolstoy in Tolstoï, le dernier automne (2009). Two years later, the first paragraph of his obituary was written when the 82-year-old Plummer became the oldest person in Academy history to win an Oscar. He won for playing a senior citizen who comes out as gay after the death of his wife in the movie Beginners (2010). As he clutched his statuette, the debonaire thespian addressed it thusly: \"You're only two years older than me darling, where have you been all of my life?\" Plummer then told the audience that at birth, \"I was already rehearsing my Academy acceptance speech, but it was so long ago mercifully for you I've forgotten it.\" The Academy Award was a long time in coming and richly deserved. Aside from the youngest member of the Barrymore siblings (which counted Oscar-winners Ethel Barrymore and Lionel Barrymore in their number), Christopher Plummer is the premier Shakespearean actor to come out of North America in the 20th century. He was particularly memorable as Hamlet, Iago and Lear, though his Macbeth opposite Glenda Jackson was -- and this was no surprise to him due to the famous curse attached to the \"Scottish Play\" -- a failure. Plummer also has given many fine portrayals on film, particularly as he grew older and settled down into a comfortable marriage with his third wife Elaine. He thanked her from the stage during the 2012 Oscar telecast, quipping that she \"deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for coming to my rescue every day of my life.\" Like another great stage actor, Richard Burton, the younger Plummer failed to connect with the screen in a way that would make him a star. Dynamic on stage, the charisma failed to transfer through the lens onto celluloid. Burton's early film career, when he was a contract player at 20th Century-Fox, failed to ignite despite his garnering two Oscar nominations early on. He did not become a superstar until the mid-1960s, after hooking up with Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Cleopatra (1963). It was Liz whom he credited with teaching him how to act on film. Christopher Plummer never made it as a leading man in films. Perhaps if he had been born earlier, and acted in the studio system of Hollywood's golden age, he could have been carefully groomed for stardom. As it was he shared the English stage actors' disdain -- and he was equally at home in London as he was on the boards of Broadway or on-stage in his native Canada -- for the movies, which did not help him in that medium, as he has confessed. As he aged, Plummer excelled at character parts. He was always a good villain, this man who garnered kudos playing Lucifer on Broadway in Archibald Macleish's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"J.B.\". Though he likely always be remembered as \"Captain Von Trapp\" in the atomic bomb-strength blockbuster The Sound of Music (1965) (a film he publicly despised until softening his stance in his 2008 autobiography \"In Spite of Me\"), his later film work includes such outstanding performances as the best cinema Sherlock Holmes--other than Basil Rathbone -- in Murder by Decree (1979), the chilling villain in L'argent de la banque (1978), his iconoclastic Mike Wallace in The Insider (1999), the empathetic psychiatrist in A Beautiful Mind (2001), and as Leo Tolstoy in Tolstoï, le dernier automne (2009). It was this last role that finally brought him recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, when he was nominated as Best Actor in a supporting role. Plummer remains one of the most respected and honored actors performing in the English language. He's won two Emmy Awards out of six nominations stretching 46 years from 1959 and 2005, and one Genie Award in five nominations from 1980 to 2004. For his stage work, Plummer has racked up two Tony Awards on six nominations, the first in 1974 as Best Actor (Musical) for the title role in \"Cyrano\" and the second in 1997, as Best Actor (Play), in \"Barrymore\". Surprisingly, he did not win (though he was nominated) for his masterful 2004 performance of \"King Lear\", which he originated at the Stratford Festival in Ontario and brought down to Broadway for a sold-out run. His other Tony nominations show the wide range of his talent, from a 1959 nod for the Elia Kazan-directed production of Macleish's \"J.B.\" to recognition in 1994 for Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\", with a 1982 Best Actor (Play) nomination for his \"Iago\" in William Shakespeare's \"Othello\". He continues to be a very in-demand character actor in prestigious motion pictures. If he were English rather than Canadian, he'd have been knighted long ago. (In 1968, he was awarded Companion of the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honor and one which required the approval of the sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II.) If he lived in the company town of Los Angeles rather than in Connecticut, he likely would have several more Oscar nominations before winning his first for \"The Last Station\". As it is, as attested to in his witty and well-written autobiography, Christopher Plummer has been amply rewarded in life. In 1970, Plummer - a self-confessed 43-year-old \"bottle baby\" - married his third wife, dancer Elaine Taylor, who helped wean him off his dependency on alcohol. They live happily with their dogs on a 30-acre estate in Weston, Connecticut. Although he spends the majority of his time in the United States, he remains a Canadian citizen. His daughter, with actress Tammy Grimes, is actress Amanda Plummer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MzQ5MDY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxOTU5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001626","name":"Christopher Plummer","nicknames":["Chris"],"idIMDB":"nm0001626"},"actorId":"nm0001626","character":"Bill","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0458181","main":true},{"actorName":"Dermot Mulroney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000551","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM2ODM3NTc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTYwMzM0._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 October 1963","placeOfBirth":" Alexandria, Virginia, USA","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Dermot Mulroney was born in Alexandria, Virginia, to Ellen and Michael Mulroney, a law professor at Villanova.

The daughter of Lester Napier Stockard, a well-to-do shipping executive, and Mary Alice (née English) Stockard, her father died when she was 16 and left her a sizable estate. She grew up in Brooklyn and attended the prolific Chapin School in NYC, then later attended the Madeira School, a Virginia boarding school for girls. She studied at Radcliffe College where she majored in both literature and history before graduating summa cum laude in 1965. In 1964, at the age of 20, she married the first of four husbands, Walter Channing Jr., a businessman whose last name she kept as part of her own stage moniker after their divorce four years later. Stockard made her stage debut in a production of \"The Investigation\" at the experimental Theatre Company of Boston in 1966. She went on to play a number of offbeat roles with the company. She eventually migrated to New York where she took her first Broadway bow as a chorus member and understudy in the musical version of \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" in 1971. Two years later she would take over the prime role of Julia in the L.A. national company. Other theater roles during this time included \"Adaptation/Next\" (1970) \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" (1970), \"Play Strindberg\" (1971) and \"No Hard Feelings\" (1973). Somewhat plaintive yet unique-looking, the dark-haired actress began first appearing in pictures with small parts in the dark comedy The Hospital (1971) and the edgy Barbra Streisand fantasy-drama Up the Sandbox (1972). Taking on the top female lead as an heiress and potential victim of shysters Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty in Mike Nichols' comedy The Fortune (1975), the film, despite its male star power, would not become the star-making hit for Channing as initially hoped and Channing. Her next two films (The Big Bus (1976) and Sweet Revenge (1976)) faded away even quicker. Earlier, however, she hit a home with the TV-movie The Girl Most Likely to... (1973), a clever black comedy written by Joan Rivers wherein Stockard played a former ugly duckling-turned-beauty (à la plastic surgery) who knocks off the men who formerly mistreated her. This was Channing at her smart and cynical best, traits that would carry her far in Hollywood. At the age of 33(!), she was handed the feisty role of high school teen Betty Rizzo in the box-office film version of the hit musical Grease (1978) starring Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. While long in the tooth for such a role (as were others), Stockard's sly performance earned her the People's Choice Awards for Favorite Motion Picture Supporting Actress. This popular film clinched her place as a top-ranking contender. As a result, she was handed two sitcom vehicles within a year on CBS: Stockard Channing in Just Friends (1979), as a newly-separated wife starting life anew in another city (L.A.), and The Stockard Channing Show (1980), which again cast her as a divorced lady trying to find herself again in L.A. Neither made her a TV star. Both failed to catch on and lasted but a few months. Stalled at a critical juncture in her career, Stockard decided to return to her first love -- the theater. With \"Vanities\", \"Absurd Person Singular\" and \"As You Like It\" (as Rosalind) already on her resume, she earned fine notices on Broadway with the musical \"They're Playing Our Song\" replacing Lucie Arnaz in 1980, then garnered rave reviews in the part of the mother of a developmentally disabled child in the New Haven production of Peter Nichols' \"A Day in the Death of Joe Egg\" in 1982. She repeated her role on Broadway a few years later (the title now shortened to \"Joe Egg\") and copped the 1985 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Subsequent Tony nominations came her way for her offbeat work in \"The House of Blue Leaves\" (1986); \"Six Degrees of Separation\" (1991) (for which she also won an Off-Broadway Obie), \"Four Baboons Adoring the Sun\" (1992); and for her Eleanor of Aquitaine in \"The Lion in Winter\" in 1999. Award-worthy projects came her way on TV as well. Nominated for an Emmy for the CBS miniseries Echoes in the Darkness (1987), she also won a CableACE Award for her work in Tidy Endings (1988). In film, she received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations when her stage triumph, Six Degrees of Separation (1993), was turned into a film and also received the London Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress in the film _Business of Strangers, The (2001). In 1999, Stockard became a recurring member of the cast of The West Wing (1999) as First Lady Abigail Bartlet. Audiences were so drawn to her shrewd, classy character that producers wisely started featuring her regularly into the third season. In 2002 she won both Emmy and SAG awards for this role, as well as a second Emmy that same year for her supporting turn as Judy Sheppard in The Matthew Shepard Story (2002), a docudrama about the gay-bashing murder of young Matthew Shepard. Stockard thought she finally found sitcom success with the series Out of Practice (2005) and was even Emmy-nominated for her role as a sharp-tongued but caring doctor. As luck would have it, she again couldn't find a core audience and the show lasted but a mere season. Stockard continues to excel in sly, worldly roles that combine a dark wit with an even darker cynical edge. True to form, she recently completed a picture aptly titled Multiple Sarcasms (2010). Divorced four times, including one to writer/producer David Debin, she has no children. She has been in a long-term relationship with cinematographer Daniel Gillham since 1988. A sister, Lesly Stockard Smith, became mayor of Palm Beach in 2000.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyOTc0NDQ4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODYyMjA0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000330","name":"Stockard Channing","idIMDB":"nm0000330"},"actorId":"nm0000330","character":"Dolly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017955","main":true},{"actorName":"Ali Hillis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385029","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1Nzk0OTM2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwNTU4MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 December 1978","placeOfBirth":" Huntington Beach, California, USA","birthName":"Alecia Deann Hillis","height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Ali Hillis was born on December 29, 1978 in Huntington Beach, California, USA as Alecia Deann Hillis.
