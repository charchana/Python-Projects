Worthington","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Samuel Henry John Worthington was born August 2, 1976 in Surrey, England. His parents, Jeanne (Martyn) and Ronald Worthington, a power planet employee, moved the family to Australia when he was six months old, and raised him and his sister Lucinda in Warnbro, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Worthington graduated from NIDA (Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art) in 1998 at the age of 22. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of \"Arthur Wellesley\" in his first professional role in the Belvoir Street Theatre production \"Judas Kiss\" (directed by Neil Armfield). He then went on to work in Australian television on such shows as Brigade des mers (1996) and \"Backburner\" and then on the American TV show JAG (1995)'s 100th episode (Boomerang: Part 1). Worthington made his film debut in the highly acclaimed Australian movie Bootmen (2000), a film about a troop of \"tap dogs\". Minor roles proceeded in Hart's War (2002) and A Matter of Life (2001) before he was cast in another hailed Australian drama, Dirty Deeds (2002), co-starring Toni Collette and John Goodman. The following year, he starred in yet another Aussie film, opposite David Wenham in Gettin' Square (2003). The director of the film, Jonathan Teplitzky, originally tested actors who were up to 8 years older than the then-27-year-old Worthington. Teplitzky wasn't sure Sam \"could convincingly play a tough guy and also have elements of the leading man about him\", but in the end Teplitzky decided he was \"fantastic\", and had \"David playing the older, slightly more streetwise accomplice\" proclaiming \"it worked\". But it wasn't until 2004 that Sam got his big break. He was offered the starring role in Cate Shortland's acclaimed Australian drama Le saut périlleux (2004), opposite Abbie Cornish. The film made a clean sweep of the Australian Film Institute awards in 2004, winning in 13 film categories - the first time this has ever occurred in the award's history. Worthington also won the AFI award for Best Male Actor. Worthington's career took off internationally when he was cast as Jake Sully in James Cameron's Avatar (2009) and as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who assists the humans despite their suspicions of him in Terminator Salvation (2009). Worthington soon became a household name, and starring in high profile films Clash of the Titans (2010), The Debt (2010), Texas Killing Fields (2011), Man on a Ledge (2012), and La colère des Titans (2012). Worthington also provided the voice for the Call of Duty: Black Ops video games. In 2010, Worthington started a production company, Full Clip Productions, with two of his close friends John Schwarz and Michael Schwarz. The company teamed with Radical studios to print two graphic novels Damaged and Patriots.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NTMyMjIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyNjYwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941777","name":"Sam Worthington","idIMDB":"nm0941777"},"actorId":"nm0941777","character":"Jake Sully","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0098390","main":true},{"actorName":"Zoe Saldana","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757855","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDk1NTA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIzMjQ4Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 June 1978","placeOfBirth":" Passaic, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Zoë Yadira Saldaña Nazario","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Zoe Saldana was born on June 19, 1978 in Passaic, New Jersey, to Asalia Nazario and Aridio Saldaña. Her father was Dominican and her mother is Puerto Rican. She was raised in Queens, New York. When she was 10 years old, she and her family moved to the Dominican Republic where they would live for the next seven years. While living in the Dominican Republic, Zoe discovered a keen interest in performance dance and began her training at the prestigious ECOS Espacio de Danza Dance Academy where she learned ballet as well as other dance forms. Not only did her training provide an excellent outlet for the enthusiastic and energetic youngster, it would also prove to be a fortunate precursor for the start of her professional acting career. At age 17, Zoe and her family moved back to the United States where her love for dance followed and an interest in theater performance became stronger. She began performing with the Faces theater troupe which put on plays geared to provide positive messages for teens with themes dealing with issues such as substance abuse and sex. These performances not only gave her valuable experience but also a source of great pride knowing that she was making a difference in the lives of young people like herself. While performing with the Faces troupe and also the New York Youth Theater, Zoe was recruited for a talent agency and her dance training years before coupled with her acting experience greatly helped her land her first big screen role as Eva Rodriguez, the talented and headstrong ballet dancer in the film Center Stage (2000). Since her professional career began several years ago, Zoe's talent and determination has allowed her to be involved in blockbuster films and act with major actors, actresses and industry insiders at a pace that very few young professionals have experienced. Zoe has not only held her own in major motion picture productions but gained the respect and praise from industry insiders such as Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg and actors/actresses such as Tom Hanks, Bernie Mac, Keira Knightley, Ashton Kutcher, Kirsten Dunst and Orlando Bloom. According to many of her co-stars, producers and directors, the sky is no limit for this young star who has incredible range, intense concentration, and a steely determination to be involved with projects that challenge her professionally with wide-ranging subject matters and characters. Just to ask practically anyone who she has worked for or with about her, glowing comments abound and earned friendships and respect are readily revealed. A star has been born, and growing every day.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDk1NTA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIzMjQ4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757855","name":"Zoe Saldana","idIMDB":"nm0757855"},"actorId":"nm0757855","character":"Neytiri","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0098391","main":true},{"actorName":"Sigourney Weaver","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MTcyNTE3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MTMyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 October 1949","placeOfBirth":" Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Susan Alexandra Weaver","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Sigourney Weaver was born Susan Alexandra Weaver in Leroy Hospital in Manhattan, New York City. Her father, TV producer Sylvester L. Weaver Jr., originally wanted to name her Flavia, because of his passion for Roman history (he had already named her elder brother Trajan). Her mother, Elizabeth Inglis (née Desiree Mary Lucy Hawkins), was an English actress who had sacrificed her career for a family. Sigourney grew up in a virtual bubble of guiltless bliss, being taken care of by nannies and maids. By 1959, the Weavers had resided in 30 different households. In 1961, Sigourney began attending the Brearley Girls Academy, but her mother moved her to another New York private school, Chapin. Sigourney was quite a bit taller than most of her other classmates (at the age of 13, she was already 5' 10\"), resulting in her constantly being laughed at and picked on; in order to gain their acceptance, she took on the role of class clown. In 1962, her family moved to San Francisco briefly, an unpleasant experience for her. Later, they moved back east to Connecticut, where she became a student at the Ethel Walker School, facing the same problems as before. In 1963, she changed her name to \"Sigourney\", after the character \"Sigourney Howard\" in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" (her own birth name, Susan, was in honor of her mother's best friend, explorer Susan Pretzlik). Sigourney had already starred in a school drama production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and, in 1965, she worked during the summer with a stock troupe, performing in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\" (she didn't star in the latter because she was taller than the lead actor!). After graduating from school in 1967, she spent some months in a kibbutz in Israel. At that time, she became engaged to reporter Aaron Latham, but they soon broke up. In 1969, Sigourney enrolled in Stanford University, majoring in English Literature. She also participated in school plays, especially Japanese Noh plays. By that time she was living in a tree house, alongside a male friend, dressed in elf-like clothes! After completing her studies in 1971, she applied for the Yale School of Drama in New Haven. Despite appearing at the audition reading a Bertolt Brecht speech and wearing a rope-like belt, she was accepted by the school but her professors rejected her, because of her height, and kept typecasting her as prostitutes and old women (whereas classmate Meryl Streep was treated almost reverently). However, in 1973, while making her theatrical debut with \"Watergate Classics\", she met up with a team of playwrights and actors and began hanging around with them, resulting in long-term friendships with Christopher Durang, Kate McGregor-Stewart and Albert Innaurato. In 1974, she starred in such plays as Aristophanes' \"Frogs\" and Durang's \"The Nature and Purpose of the Universe\" and \"Daryl and Carol and Kenny and Jenny\", as \"Jenny\". After finishing her studies that year, she began seriously pursuing a stage career, but her height kept being a hindrance. However, she continued working on stage with Durang (in \"Titanic\" [1975]) and Innaurato (in \"Gemini\" [1976]). Other 1970s stage works included \"Marco Polo Sing a Song\", \"The Animal Kingdom\", \"A Flea in Her Ear\", \"The Constant Husband\", \"Conjuring an Event\" and others. However, the one that really got her noticed was \"Das Lusitania Songspiel\", a play she co-wrote with Durang and in which she starred for two seasons, from 1979 to 1981. She was also up for a Drama Desk Award for it. During the mid-70s, she appeared in several TV spots and even starred as \"Avis Ryan\" in the soap opera Somerset (1970). In 1977, she was cast in the role Shelley Duvall finally played in Annie Hall (1977), after rejecting the part due to prior stage commitments. In the end, however, Woody Allen offered her a part in the film that, while short (she was on-screen for six seconds), made many people sit up and take notice. She later appeared in Madman (1978) and, of course, Alien (1979). The role of the tough, uncompromising \"Ripley\" made Sigourney an \"overnight\" star and brought her a British Award Nomination. She next appeared in Eyewitness (1981) and L'année de tous les dangers (1982), the latter being a great success in Australia that won an Oscar and brought Sigourney and co-star Mel Gibson to Cannes in 1983. The same year she delivered an honorary Emmy award to her father, a few months before her uncle, actor Doodles Weaver, committed suicide. That year also brought her a romance with Jim Simpson, her first since having broken up two years previously with James M. McClure. She and Simpson were married on 1 October 1984. Sigourney had, meanwhile, played in the poorly received Deal of the Century (1983) and the mega-hit Ghostbusters (1984). She was also nominated for a Tony Award for her tour-de-force performance in the play \"Hurly Burly\". Then followed One Woman or Two (1985), Half Moon Street (1986) and Aliens (1986). The latter was a huge success, and Sigourney was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Oscar. She then entered her most productive career period and snatched Academy Award nominations, in both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, for her intense portrayal of Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist (1988) and her delicious performance as a double-crossing, power-hungry corporate executive in Working Girl (1988). She ended up losing in both, but made up for it to a degree by winning both Golden Globes. After appearing in a documentary about fashion photographer Helmut Newton, Helmut Newton: Frames from the Edge (1989), and reprising her role in the sequel Ghostbusters II (1989), she discovered she was pregnant and retired from public life for a while. She gave birth to her daughter, Charlotte Simpson, on 13 April 1990, and returned to the movies as a (now skinhead) Ripley in Alien 3 (1992) and a gorgeous \"Queen Isabella of Spain\" in 1492: Christophe Colomb (1992), her second film with director Ridley Scott. She starred in the political comedy Dave (1993) alongside Kevin Kline, and then a Roman Polanski thriller, Death and the Maiden (1994). In 1995, she was seen in Jeffrey (1995) and Copycat (1995). The next year, she \"trod the boards\" in \"Sex and Longing\", yet another Durang play. She hadn't performed in the theater in many years before that play, her last stage performances occurring in the 1980s in \"As You Like It\" (1981), \"Beyond Therapy\" (1981), \"The Marriage of 'Bette and Boo'\" (1985) and \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1986). In 1997, she was the protagonist in Grimm's Snow White: A Tale of Terror (1997), Ice Storm (1997) and Alien: Resurrection (1997). Her performance in Ice Storm (1997) got her a BAFTA prize and another Golden Globe nod. She also gave excellent performances in A Map of the World (1999) and the sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest (1999). Her next comedy, Company Man (2000), wasn't quite so warmly welcomed critically and financially, however. She next played a sexy con artist in Heartbreakers (2001) and had a voice role in Big Bad Love (2001). Her father died at the age of 93. Sigourney herself has recently starred in Tadpole (2000) and is planning a cinematic version of The Guys (2002), the enthralling September 11th one-act drama she played on stage on late 2001. At age 60, she played a crucial role in Avatar (2009), which became the top box-office hit of all time. The film reunited her with her Aliens (1986) director James Cameron. Her beauty, talent, and hard-work keeps the ageless actress going, and she has continued to win respect from her fans and directors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MTcyNTE3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244","name":"Sigourney Weaver","nicknames":["The Actress's Actress","The Sci-Fi Queen"],"idIMDB":"nm0000244"},"actorId":"nm0000244","character":"Dr. Grace Augustine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0062576","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephen Lang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002332","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NzYwNTc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQzOTUyNw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 July 1952","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"A stage actor of great recognition, Stephen Lang has shaped a formidable career on and off the various stages of the United States and abroad.

She was born Mayte Michelle Rodriguez on July 12, 1978, in Bexar County, Texas, to Carmen Milady Pared Espinal, from the Dominican Republic, and Rafael Rodríguez Santiago, who served in the U.S. Army and was originally from Puerto Rico. Michelle always knew she was destined to become a star, she just didn't know how to get there. Michelle lived in Texas until the age of 8 when her family moved to the Dominican Republic where she lived for two years before moving to Puerto Rico. At 11, Michelle's family relocated for the last time to Jersey City, New Jersey. Although she has been working since 1999 as an extra in such films as Summer of Sam (1999) and Cradle Will Rock (1999), it only took a magazine ad announcing an open casting call in New York for Michelle to decide to finally step into the spotlight. The role was the female lead, the movie was Girlfight (2000). Despite the lack of experience in film and boxing, Michelle auditioned, along with another 350 girls. After various trials inside an actual boxing ring and five arduous months of training in Brooklyn's Gleason's Gym, she was finally chosen to portray the role of Diana Guzman. As soon as the independent film began making the rounds at various film festivals, Michelle began gaining critical acclaim for her performance earning her awards like the Deauville Festival of American Cinema award for Best Actress and the Las Vegas Film Critics Society for Female Breakthrough Performance. As Girlfight (2000) continued to gain notoriety with its September 2000 release, Michelle was already hard at work with films like 3 A.M. (2001), the blockbuster hit The Fast and the Furious (2001), and Resident Evil (2002).

Born on Christmas Day 1952 in Guyana, she was raised on a sugar cane plantation. Her parents moved to the States while she was still a young girl, but she and her sister were sent to a convent boarding school in Britain where they were introduced to art and the classics. Following high school graduation, she arrived in New York and studied at Ithaca College, where her acting talents were discovered. Regional and classical repertory theater followed, earning roles in such productions as \"The Mighty Gents\" with Morgan Freeman at the New York Shakespeare Festival and \"Open Admissions,\" her Broadway debut.

Studi has since appeared in more than 80 film and television productions, including Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), Being Flynn (2012), Avatar (2009), Comanche Moon (2008), Streets of Laredo (1995), Mystery Men (1999), Kings (TV Series), The New World (2005), Hell on Wheels: L'Enfer de l'Ouest (2011), Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007) and Seraphim Falls (2006). He also brought Tony Hillerman's \"Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn\" to life in a series of PBS specials produced by Robert Redford: Skinwalkers (2002), Coyote Waits (2003), and A Thief of Time (2004). Studi was born in Nofire Hollow, Oklahoma, the son of Maggie (Nofire), a housekeeper, and Andy Studie, a ranch hand. Studi exclusively spoke his native Cherokee language until beginning school at the age of five. A professional horse trainer, Studi began acting at The American Indian Theatre Company in Tulsa in the mid-80s. Studi and his wife, Maura Dhu Studi, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico. They have a son, Kholan. Studi has a daughter, Leah, and a son, Daniel, from a previous marriage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyODcyMzgwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIzNTUyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836071","name":"Wes Studi","idIMDB":"nm0836071"},"actorId":"nm0836071","character":"Eytukan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0173894","main":true},{"actorName":"Laz Alonso","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0022306","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0OTI4MjA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2NjQ5MTE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 March 1974","placeOfBirth":" Washington, District of Columbia, USA","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Born and raised in Washington DC, Laz always knew he wanted to be an actor. He remembers at a very early age entertaining his family by imitating relatives and family friends. He graduated from the prestigious Howard University School of Business, earning a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. After college, he worked on Wall Street at an investment banking firm. He and several partners eventually started their own marketing business, promoting mainstream products to the trend-setting urban market. Owning and operating his own successful business freed up Laz's time to finally explore his passion for acting. Laz began taking classes in the evening to hone his craft and it didn't take him long to begin landing roles in commercials and videos. From D.C. to New York, Laz feels his upbringing not only taught him how to deal with the school of hard knocks, but also prepared him for his biggest goal, his acting career. He credits the move to NYC as his move into manhood and the city holds many great memories for him. Laz also credits his acting ability to these life experiences, as he is able to bring a little of what he knows or has dealt with into his characters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0OTI4MjA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2NjQ5MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0022306","name":"Laz Alonso","idIMDB":"nm0022306"},"actorId":"nm0022306","character":"Tsu'tey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0098395","main":true},{"actorName":"Dileep Rao","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2438307","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5Nzc2NTc2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM2MTc1Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 July 1973","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Dileep A.

His father was the executive director of the University of Southern California, Community Services Center, and his mother worked for Operation Breadbasket and other organizations dedicated to improving economic conditions of black communities. After studying electrical engineering for two years at USC, he sat in on a friends acting class, was immediately bitten by the bug and auditioned for USC's Bachelor of Fine Arts acting conservatory the next semester. He started over as a freshman and completed the program in 1986. In 1987, Scott earned his SAG card on the feature film \"Punchline\". After several equity waiver plays and TV guest stars, Scott landed his first TV series regular role as Whoopi Goldberg's son on the short lived \"Bagdad Cafe\". The show ended in 1990 and after a few more years in Hollywood, Scott decided to pack up and move to New York to pursue his first love, the theatre. In NYC he worked in off and off-off Broadway shows and was invited into the elite Drama Department Theatre Company for which he performed Tennesee Williams' three character play, \"Kingdom of Earth\" with Cynthia Nixon and Peter Sarsgaard, directed by John Cameron Mitchell. Scott's proudest theater moment came when he was cast by Lloyd Richards to play Walter Lee in Lorraine Hansberry's, \"A Raisin in the Sun\". Lloyd fell sick but the production went on to rave reviews at Fords Theater in Washington DC, directed by Seret Scott in 1995. Scott stayed in New York for a few more years working in TV, film and theatre before returning to Los Angeles in 1998. In 1999, he was cast in a guest starring role on the pilot for the CBS drama, \"First Monday\". Producer/creator/ director, Don Bellasario admired his work enough to create the role of 'Cmdr. Sturgis Turner' for Scott on his long running, hit series \"JAG\". Scott played the role from 2000 to 2004, when the show was canceled. He continues to live and work in Hollywood, recent notable credits include \"The Social Network\" and James Cameron's \"Avatar\". Upcoming credits Include J.J. Abrams next \"Star Trek\" feature and \"The Host\", directed by Andrew Niccol. Both due for release in 2013. Scott is the very proud father of two sons, Morgan and Daniel.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkyY2M5NmMtOWUwZi00OTIxLWE5ODQtYzgzNWMyMDM0ZTM0L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM0MjA0Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493013","name":"Scott
