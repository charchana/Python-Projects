Born in Mumbai, India, Ranveer Singh had always wanted to be an actor since his childhood. However, during his college days he felt that the idea of acting was far-fetched and focused on creative writing. While pursuing his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University (Bloomington), Singh again became interested in acting and after coming back to India, he started auditioning for lead roles in the Hindi film industry. In 2010, Singh auditioned for the lead role in the Yash Raj Films venture called Band Baaja Baaraat (2010), and got selected. The romantic comedy was set in the world of wedding planning and required Singh to portray a typical Delhi guy called Bittoo Sharma. The director of the film, Maneesh Sharma, sent him to the Delhi University campus during the recce of the film, and from there Singh drew his inspiration for the character. After its release, Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) became a critical and commercial success, with Singh's portrayal of Bittoo being lauded by critics. He went on to win the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut award at the 56th Filmfare Awards.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTcwMDU4NTReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA0MjE1MTc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3828984","name":"Ranveer Singh","idIMDB":"nm3828984"},"actorId":"nm3828984","character":"Bittoo Sharma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anushka Sharma","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3087728","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM5YmYwNjUtNzQyYS00OGY0LTljZDAtMDNiMjhiOTFiMzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 May 1988","placeOfBirth":" Bangalore, Karnataka, India","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Anushka Sharma was born on 1 May 1988 in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. Her father, Colonel Ajay Kumar Sharma, is an army officer, and her mother, Ashima Sharma, is a homemaker. Her father is a native of Uttar Pradesh, while her mother is a Garhwali. Her elder brother is film producer Karnesh Sharma, who earlier served in the Merchant Navy. Prior to joining the navy, Karnesh played for the under-19 Bangalore Ranji cricket team. Sharma has stated that being a military brat played an important role in shaping her as a person and contributing to her life. In an interview with The Times of India in 2012, she said, \"I take pride in saying that I am an army officer's daughter even more than being an actor. She studied in Army School and graduated with specialization in arts from Mount Carmel College, Bangalore. She then moved to Mumbai to further her modeling career. Sharma says she originally wished to make it big in the modeling world but had no strong aspirations for films. She began her modeling career at the Lakme Fashion Week as a model for Wendell Rodricks's Les Vamps Show and was picked to be Rodricks's finale model at the Spring Summer '07 Collection. Since then she has done campaigns for Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio. Her first acting role was in Aditya Chopra's Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Shahrukh Khan. The film was a huge success and her performance was appreciated. Film critic Taran Adarsh said, \"Anushka looks the character and surprises you with a confident performance. It's no small achievement to share screen space with an actor of the caliber of SRK and Anushka manages it very well from start to end.\" Her second film, Badmaash Company, also under Yash Raj Films, was released on May 7, 2010. She was praised for breaking out of the shell of the conservative and homely Taani to play the feisty and independent Bulbul, and her performance was applauded. She has two other projects on hand. She began shooting for her first venture outside of Yash Raj with Nikhil Advani and Akshay Kumar in Patiala House in December 2009. Patiala House is scheduled to be released on February 11, 2011. She has also started filming for her third Yash Raj Film, Band Baaja Baaraat, directed by Maneesh Sharma and co-starring debutant Ranveer Singh.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM5YmYwNjUtNzQyYS00OGY0LTljZDAtMDNiMjhiOTFiMzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3087728","name":"Anushka Sharma","idIMDB":"nm3087728"},"actorId":"nm3087728","character":"Shruti Kakkar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ranjit Batra","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6560386","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ranjit Batra is known for his work on Highway (2014), Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6560386","name":"Ranjit Batra","idIMDB":"nm6560386"},"actorId":"nm6560386","character":"Father","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Manu Rishi Chadha","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2286188","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDc5YzUwYTEtM2QwYi00ZDNjLWJmZWMtYTM1ZjNlMGRlN2ZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Manu Rishi Chadha is an actor and writer, known for Oye Lucky!
