He studied theater and English literature at Wesleyan University and earned a master's degree in theater from the prestigious Juilliard Theater Center. Whitford's first professional performance was in the off-Broadway production of \"Curse of the Starving Class,\" with Kathy Bates. He also starred in the Broadway production of \"The West Wing\" creator Aaron Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men.\" His additional theater credits include \"Three Days of Rain\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club, \"Measure for Measure\" at the Lincoln Center, and the title role in \"Coriolanus\" at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. Some of Whitford's most memorable performances include roles in such films as The Muse (1999) with Albert Brooks and Bicentennial Man (1999) with Robin Williams. He has also appeared in Scent of a Woman (1992), A Perfect World (1993), Philadelphia (1993), The Client (1994), My Life (1993), Red Corner (1997), Presumed Innocent (1990), and My Fellow Americans (1996).
