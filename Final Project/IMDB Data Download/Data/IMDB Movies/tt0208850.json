The resulting footage is shown time-lapsed, one day compressed into four minutes. The footage starts just before dawn and concludes just after night falls. The camera occasionally veers its focus out into the open water instead of on the lighthouse, showing the large number of sailboats offshore. The film primarily shows pleasure craft coming in and out of the harbor, the relatively still ocean water this day, and the pedestrians wandering around the lighthouse pier.","simplePlot":"One day of the Cassis port filmed in one shot.","actors":[],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0208850","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208850","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["4 min (USA)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["16 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"5.6","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Cassis, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, France"}],"awards":[],"votes":"102","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[],"keywords":{"keywords":["experimental film","independent film"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 22:59:04"}}
