Following Broadway and television experience, he made a strong film debut in The Strange One (1957). He started getting noticed when he played Robert Mitchum's illegitimate son in the popular melodrama Home from the Hill (1960). He then established himself as a leading man, giving arguably his most memorable film performance as Audrey Hepburn's love interest in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). Seen by the studios as a promising young star, Peppard was subsequently cast in some of the major blockbusters of the early/mid-1960s: How the West Was Won (1962), The Victors (1963), The Carpetbaggers (1964) and Operation Crossbow (1965). He reached the peak of his popularity in another such lavish production, The Blue Max (1966), in which he effectively played an obsessively competitive German flying officer during World War I. However, by the late 1960s, he seemed to settle as a tough lead in more average, often hokum, adventures, including House of Cards (1968), Cannon for Cordoba (1970) and The Groundstar Conspiracy (1972). In the early 1970s, his declining popularity was temporarily boosted thanks to the television series Banacek (1972). With his film roles becoming increasingly uninteresting, he acted in, directed and produced the drama Five Days from Home (1978), but the result was rather disappointing. In the mid-1980s, he again obtained success on television as Colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith, the cigar-chomping leader of The A-Team (1983). George Peppard died at age 65 of pneumonia on May 8, 1994 in Los Angeles, California. He is buried alongside his parents in Northview Cemetary in Dearborn, Michigan.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTczNDE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY5Mzg3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000577","name":"George Peppard","idIMDB":"nm0000577"},"actorId":"nm0000577","character":"P.J.

Landing a stage role in \"Porgy and Bess\" in 1949, he quit physical education studies at CCNY and went on tour with the acclaimed musical. His film debut came in Carmen Jones (1954), but he really began to make a name for himself - having dropped his real name, George Fisher, in 1953 - in such films as To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and The L-Shaped Room (1962). He received a Tony Award nomination for his starring stint in Broadway's \"Lost in the Stars\" in 1973.

Saint James was born Susan Jane Miller in Los Angeles, California, to Constance (Geiger), a teacher, and Charles Daniel Miller, a businessman. She has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Saint James was raised in Rockford, Illinois. A model briefly during her teens in both the US and in France, she soon headed to Hollywood to try her luck. Luck certainly came her way quickly as she landed a seven-year contract with Universal Studios within a heart beat. And, if that wasn't lucky enough, her very first TV job would be in the highly popular 1966 crime thriller telepic Fame Is the Name of the Game (1966) starring ultra cool Anthony Franciosa and sexy femme fatale Jill St. John. Despite her model good looks, Susan downplayed her sexy allure in favor of a down-to-earth appeal. It paid off. She played the relatively innocent and awkward amateur sleuth \"Peggy Maxwell\", Anthony Franciosa's \"girl Friday\", who always snooped a bit too much and found herself in life-threatening circumstances with Anthony Franciosa saving the day. Audiences took to Saint James and her character quickly. She continued as Peggy when a series based on the mini-movie evolved. The Name of the Game (1968) with Anthony Franciosa, Robert Stack and Gene Barry was a hit as well and Susan copped an Emmy for her work during the 1968-1969 season. She also had a fun recurring role as a equally klutzy thief who complicates things for Robert Wagner's suave cat burglar in It Takes a Thief (1968). But, she hit her peak as Police Commissioner Rock Hudson's plucky wife in McMillan & Wife (1971) from 1971 to 1976, her character still managing to get into her usual share of danger and trouble. A couple of noticeable roles in the films Outlaw Blues (1977) and the popular Dracula spoof Love at First Bite (1979) opposite George Hamilton could not set the foundation for a lasting movie career, however. She wisely returned to the TV series format co-starring with Jane Curtin in the liberal-minded sitcom Kate & Allie (1984), which would last five seasons. She played an adventurous libber versus Jane Curtin's more conservative character. Susan chose to disappear from the limelight following the end of the series, move to Connecticut and devote her time to raising a family. She would also dedicate herself to charity work, notably the Special Olympics. She has since made very few appearances in specials and guest parts (the first episode of The Drew Carey Show (1995) was one, on which her niece, Christa Miller, was a co-star) from the 90s on. She is married to NBC executive Dick Ebersol, best known for his work on Saturday Night Live (1975) and is the mother of five children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3OTc2ODU0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAzODE0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756634","name":"Susan Saint James","idIMDB":"nm0756634"},"actorId":"nm0756634","character":"Linette Orbison","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Severn Darden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201089","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 November 1929","placeOfBirth":" New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","bio":"Severn Darden was born on November 9, 1929 in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.

John Qualen was born in Canada to Norwegian parents. His father was a minister. The family moved to the United States and Qualen (whose real name was Kvalen) grew up in Elgin, Illinois. He won an oratory contest and was given a scholarship to Northwestern University. His interest in acting was piqued there, and he began appearing in tent shows on the Lyceum-Chautauqua circuit, and in stock. He went to New York in 1929 and got his big break as the Swedish janitor in Elmer Rice's Street Scene. He repeated the role two years later in the film version. That same year he first worked for director John Ford in Arrowsmith (1931). He became a member of Ford's famed \"stock company, and had prominent roles for Ford for the next thirty-five years. He became a most familiar character player, specializing in Scandinavians of various nationalities, but frequently playing a wide variety of other ethnicities. Perhaps his greatest work among many memorable roles was as the pitiful Muley, who recounts the destruction of his farm by the bank in Ford's masterpiece, The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Although plagued in his later years by failing eyesight, he continued to work steadily into his final years. He was treasurer of The Authors Club and historian of The Masquers, Hollywood's famed social group for actors. He had three children, Elizabeth, Kathleen, and Meredith. Qualen died in 1987.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNjg1NTM5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkxNzYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702798","name":"John Qualen","idIMDB":"nm0702798"},"actorId":"nm0702798","character":"Poppa Gonowski","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bert Freed","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293099","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NTE2NjA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5MTYxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1919","placeOfBirth":" The Bronx, New York, USA","birthName":"Bertram Freed","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"During the '50s and '60s it seemed like every time you turned around, there was Bert Freed as a detective, gangster, sheriff or greedy small-town businessman, and sci-fi fans will remember him as the police chief taken over by the Martians in the classic Invaders from Mars (1953). He played a lot of tough cops--sometimes crooked ones, sometimes racist ones, sometimes violent ones, sometimes a combination of all three--and a lot of tough soldiers, but he could also play a jovial family patriarch when called upon. Born and raised in New York, Freed began acting while attending Penn State University, and made his Broadway debut in 1942. His film debut occurred, oddly enough, in a musical--Carnegie Hall (1947)--and he went on to play everything from a gangster in a Ma and Pa Kettle movie (Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1950)) to a French army sergeant--a first-rate job, too--in the classic Paths of Glory (1957). It seems as if he appeared in just about every cop and detective series on TV at one time or another. He retired from acting in 1981, and died of a heart attack in Canada in 1994 while on a fishing trip with his son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NTE2NjA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5MTYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293099","name":"Bert Freed","idIMDB":"nm0293099"},"actorId":"nm0293099","character":"Police Lieutenant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0063402","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063402","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 49 min (109 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono (Westrex Recording System)"],"color":["Color (Technicolor)"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Technicolor, USA"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm (2-perf)"],"cinematographicProcess":["Techniscope"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.4","filmingLocations":[{"location":"New York City, New York, USA"}],"rated":"APPROVED","awards":[],"votes":"173","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0005073","name":"Universal Pictures"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["mistress","new york city","punctuation in title","violence","private detective","murder","down and out","bodyguard","character name in title"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 17:31:22"}}
