Bendix was actually born in the Borough of Manhattan (New York City proper), in a midtown flat hard by the tracks of the long-since defunct Third-Avenue Elevated Railway. (Manhattan sections of the \"El,\" as New Yorkers called it, were demolished circa 1956.) Jut-jawed, broken-nosed and burly, Bendix began his acting career after the ravages of the Great Depression had killed his erstwhile grocery business. Having performed in nightclubs even while grocer, and having portrayed taxicab drivers in a series of Broadway flops, he enjoyed his first notable performance on the Broadway stage in 1939, portraying the cop Krupp in William Saroyan's \"The Time of Your Life.\" His Hollywood feature debut came about in one of his few starring roles, in Hal Roach's Brooklyn Orchid (1942). But more often than not, in his movies Bendix received less than top billing, inasmuch as so many of his film assignments involved supporting roles. Despite (or perhaps on account of) his looks he was often called upon to supply comedic support, as in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1949), when, portraying Sir Sagramore of King Arthur's Round Table in full suit of armor and pageboy wig, he waxeth eloquent, in his Brooklyn accent but in the most incongruent of Middle English dialects! On the other hand, that same craggy appearance had him in such roles as that of the thug Jeff in The Glass Key (1942), in which he repeatedly and gleefully uses his fists to beat star Alan Ladd's face to a pulp and then sadistically challenges Ladd, once he is healed, to come back and receive further \"treatment\"! Although he will always be fondly remembered for his light-comedy portrayals (in *three* of the mass media!) of Chester A. Riley in The Life of Riley (1949) and The Life of Riley (1953), perhaps William Bendix's finest and most memorable dramatic performance came in Lifeboat (1944), when he touchingly interprets the role of Gus, the shipwreck survivor whose gangrenous limb has to be removed, the absence of anesthesia notwithstanding.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NDAzODQ2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY4NDE2MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000904","name":"William Bendix","nicknames":["Bill"],"idIMDB":"nm0000904"},"actorId":"nm0000904","character":"Sergeant Harrigan, USAF","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ron Randell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0709681","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwZGEwOTEtMjMxOS00NjY5LWE0NTEtYjc0MDk3ZWMyYzZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 October 1918","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Ronald Egan Randell","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Sydney-born Ron Randell began his six-decade-long career in his teens on radio in his native Australia for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He promptly moved to the stage, where he acted with the Minerva Theatre Group from 1937 to 1946, while intermittently appearing in Australian films. Well-received reviews for his title role in the movie, Pacific Adventure (1946) [Pacific Adventure], led to a Hollywood contract, making his debut in It Had to Be You (1947) in support of Ginger Rogers and Cornel Wilde. Randell went on to play both hero and villain in both a lead and supporting capacity. His host of \"B\" pictures included short runs as supersleuth \"Bulldog Drummond\" and \"the Lone Wolf\". Although he was never a top name per se, he led a durable transatlantic film career for much of the 50s and 60s, which included a minor role as composer Cole Porter in Kiss Me Kate (1953), lead in the gangster flick, Most Dangerous Man Alive (1961) and Lucius, the Centurion who tries to save Jesus at his trial, and becomes converted to Christianity after the Crucifixion in King of Kings (1961). From the \"Golden Age\" of 50s TV, he went on star in the American/British espionage series, O.S.S. (1957), for a season, and guest-starred on such programs as Bewitched (1964), The Farmer's Daughter (1963), Mission: Impossible (1966), Bonanza (1959) and The F.B.I. (1965), playing a number of cultivated gents. On Broadway, he enjoyed healthy critical successes, such as \"The Browning Version\" (1949), a revival of \"Candida\" (1952), \"The World of Suzie Wong\" (1958), \"Butley\" (1972), \"Sherlock Holmes\" (1975), \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\" (1976) and \"Bent\" (1979). He continued his stage career, in fact, well into the 1990s, including a stint with the late Tony Randall's National Actors Theater company which included a run of \"The School for Scandal\" (1995). Randell died following complications of a stroke in a Los Angeles assisted facility at age 86 in 2005.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwZGEwOTEtMjMxOS00NjY5LWE0NTEtYjc0MDk3ZWMyYzZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0709681","name":"Ron Randell","idIMDB":"nm0709681"},"actorId":"nm0709681","character":"Captain Smith, USAF","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Walter Gross","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0343511","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 February 1904","placeOfBirth":" Eberswalde, Germany","birthName":"Walter Hugo Gross","bio":"Walter Gross was born on February 5, 1904 in Eberswalde, Germany as Walter Hugo Gross.
