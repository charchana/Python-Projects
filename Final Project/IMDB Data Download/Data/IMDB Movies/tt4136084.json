Meryl was born Mary Louise Streep in 1949 in Summit, New Jersey, to Mary Wolf (Wilkinson), a commercial artist, and Harry William Streep, Jr., a pharmaceutical executive. Her father was of German and Swiss-German descent, and her mother had English, Irish, and German ancestry. Meryl's early performing ambitions leaned toward the opera. She became interested in acting while a student at Vassar and upon graduation she enrolled in the Yale School of Drama. She gave an outstanding performance in her first film role, Julia (1977), and the next year she was nominated for her first Oscar for her role in The Deer Hunter (1978). She went on to win the Academy Award for her performances in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Sophie's Choice (1982), in which she gave a heart-wrenching portrayal of an inmate mother in a Nazi death camp. A perfectionist in her craft and meticulous and painstaking in her preparation for her roles, Meryl turned out a string of highly acclaimed performances over the next decade in great films like Silkwood (1983); Out of Africa (1985); Ironweed (1987); and A Cry in the Dark (1988). Her career declined slightly in the early 1990s as a result of her inability to find suitable parts, but she shot back to the top in 1995 with her performance as Clint Eastwood's married lover in The Bridges of Madison County (1995) and as the prodigal daughter in Marvin's Room (1996). In 1998 she made her first venture into the area of producing, and was the executive producer for the moving ...First Do No Harm (1997). A realist when she talks about her future years in film, she remarked that \"...no matter what happens, my work will stand...\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Mjk5MDExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000658","name":"Meryl Streep","idIMDB":"nm0000658"},"actorId":"nm0000658","character":"Florence Foster Jenkins","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0489214","main":true},{"actorName":"Hugh Grant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000424","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MTgxOTk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMjYwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 September 1960","placeOfBirth":" Hammersmith, London, England, UK","birthName":"Hugh John Mungo Grant","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Hugh Grant, one of Britain's best known faces, has been equally entertaining on-screen as well as in real life, and has had enough sense of humor to survive a media frenzy. He is known for his roles in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), with Andie MacDowell, Notting Hill (1999), opposite Julia Roberts, and Music and Lyrics (2007), opposite Drew Barrymore, among his other works. He was born Hugh John Mungo Grant on September 9, 1960, in Hammersmith, London, United Kingdom. His mother, Fyvola Susan (MacLean), was a teacher. His father, James Murray Grant, was an artist and carpet salesman, and his grandfather was in the British Army during WWII. He is of mostly Scottish and English descent, with many recent ancestors who were prominent in the military. Young Grant was fond of literature and acting. He won a scholarship to Oxford, going up to New College in 1979. There he was involved in student drama, and considered a career as an art historian. After Oxford, he turned down a scholarship to do postgraduate studies in Art History at the Courtauld Institute in London, and focused on his acting career. In 1982, while still a student, Grant made his big screen debut in Privileged (1982) by director Michael Hoffman. Grant's breakthrough came with the leading role as Charles in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), opposite Andie MacDowell, a role which won him a Golden Globe Award, as well as a BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor. During the 1990s Grant established himself as a very original and resourceful actor. He played a string of characters projecting a positive mindset, showing how do you stay optimistic when you are actually worried about a cascade of troubles. Grant had his own experience as a survivor of an unfortunate episode in his private life, which he managed to overcome thanks to having a pretty damn good outlook on life. His forte is playing characters projecting warmth and sincere happiness, with his hallmark stuttering, albeit some accused him of reprising the same character he has been playing for the past two decades. Grant's ability to show his character development within a limited screen time shines in Love Actually (2003), with his witty portrayal of a Prime Minister whose personal insecurities become intertwined with his country's international affairs, a performance that earned him a nomination for European Audience Award. His screen presence and skillful understatement takes his characters beyond the written script, thanks to his mastery of timing and effortless style. Outside of his acting profession, Grant has been a good athlete, he played cricket and football in his younger years. He enjoys playing golf, frequently taking part in Pro-Am tournaments. He has been an avid art lover since his younger years, and has been collecting fine art, a passion he inherited from his father.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MTgxOTk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMjYwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000424","name":"Hugh Grant","idIMDB":"nm0000424"},"actorId":"nm0000424","character":"St Clair Bayfield","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0534276","main":true},{"actorName":"Simon Helberg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0374865","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNzAwMTg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY5MjU3Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 December 1980","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Simon Maxwell Helberg","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Simon Helberg was born and raised in Los Angeles but despite this, and the fact that his father is the actor Sandy Helberg and his mother the casting director Harriet B.

Little detail is given on him, yet he has appeared in many well-known films and television series alongside a variety of actors. Kavanagh began his career with the Irish comedy, Paddy (1970), where he played the small role of \"Willie Egan\". That same year, he played another small role in the World War II film, L'évasion du capitaine Schlütter (1970), which is about a P.O.W. camp, in Scotland, whose prisoners are preparing an escape. The next twelve years brought Kavanagh no new films, though he continued to act on stage. Finally, he decided to return to screen acting with the theatrical film, The Ballroom of Romance (1982), which put him in a romance with accomplished actress Brenda Fricker. The film was followed up with the small film, Attracta (1983), and the made-for-television movie, The Country Girls (1984), starring Sam Neill. Kavanagh's next theatrical film was one of the most famous films of his career: the Irish film Cal (1984), starring Helen Mirren and John Lynch. The film was about a young member of the IRA (Lynch) who is seeking to get out of the organization. He meets the widow of one of the IRA's victims (Mirren) and begin a love affair. Moving on from this film, Kavanagh acted in a number of films and television series. He participated in the action film, The Joyriders (1999), the crime drama, Bellman and True (1987), the independent film, 4 Play: In the Border Country (1991), and the thriller, The Fantasist (1986), among others. Kavanagh's career picked up considerably in the mid-nineties. He acted alongside such classic actors as Mia Farrow and Jim Broadbent in the John Irvin film, Widows' Peak (1994). Kavanagh then guest-starred in the Sharpe series (starring Sean Bean and Hugh Fraser), where he played the holy man \"Father Michael Curtis\". That same year, he acted in the most talked about epic of its time; Mel Gibson's Braveheart (1995). Starring Gibson, Angus Macfadyen and Brendan Gleeson, Kavangh acted as one of the nobles who routinely changed sides from Scotland to England in the Scottish wars of independence. The film won Best Picture and Best Director, and was a smash hit. After this fantastic success, Kavanagh acted in Some Mother's Son (1996), a prison film which was written by Jim Sheridan, and reunited with Brenda Fricker in Pete's Meteor (1998). He continued to act in other films throughout the nineties and, as the new millennium dawned, Kavanagh continued on to new projects. After a number of smaller films, Kavanagh acted in another historical epic; the mighty Oliver Stone film, Alexander (2004), starring Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins. Kavanagh played the role of \"Parmenion\", the old general who questions Alexander's actions. After a plot to kill the young leader is foiled, Parmenion is accused of being the mastermind behind it and is murdered. While the film was a triumph overseas, its domestic budget was a fraction of the budget, and received negative reviews for a number of different reasons. After this, Kavanagh acted in Brian De Palma's murder film, Le dahlia noir (2006), which failed at the box office. Kavanagh has rebounded with the successful television series, Les Tudors (2007). Starring fellow Alexander (2004) cast member Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the series plays out the story of England's turmoil in the time of Henry the Eighth and his life as he breaks from the Catholic Church.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5ODY3Nzc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyMTUwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442559","name":"John Kavanagh","idIMDB":"nm0442559"},"actorId":"nm0442559","character":"Arturo Toscanini","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0259392","main":true},{"actorName":"Pat Starr","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0823575","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Pat Starr is an actress, known for Mission: Impossible (1996), Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) and Reds (1981).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0823575","name":"Pat Starr","idIMDB":"nm0823575"},"actorId":"nm0823575","character":"Mrs Vanderbilt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Maggie Steed","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0824353","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 December 1946","placeOfBirth":" Plymouth, Devon, England, UK","birthName":"Margaret Baker","bio":"Born Margaret Baker in Plymouth, Devon, in 1946, Maggie Steed studied drama with the Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol, graduating in the late 1960s. However, her first professional engagements were as an assistant stage manager, working behind the scenes in a somewhat lowly capacity, because, she says, she was not considered conventionally pretty enough to be an actress. She does, however, recall that the eccentric English puppeteer Harry Corbett praised her for assisting him with his creation Sooty the Bear. Maggie left theatrical life after only a few months and for several years worked as a secretary. An interest in Theatre in Education lured her back to the stage, this time as an actress, with Sue Johnston and Clive Russell at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. Since then she has worked on stage with both the Royal Shakespeare and National Theatre Companies, and in 2002 was a commanding Lady Bracknell in a revival of 'The Importance of Being Earnest'. A lady of political awareness, she was a founder member of the Campaign Against Racism in the Media, and in the early 1980s visited Nicaragua with actor Andy de la Tour to view the plight of its citizens, and in 1983, helped stage the televised Concert for Nigaragua. She is, however, best remembered for her television roles, chiefly comical ones, beginning in the early 1980s with 'Shine On Harvey Moon', through 'A Bit of a Do' and 'Pie In the Sky' as the wife of cop-turned-chef Richard Griffiths to, in the mid-2000s. 'Jam and Jerusalem' as the dim but well-meaning Women's Institute leader, a sitcom filmed in her native Devon and reuniting her with her early stage co-star Sue Johnston.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0824353","name":"Maggie Steed","idIMDB":"nm0824353"},"actorId":"nm0824353","character":"Mrs James O'Flaherty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Thelma Barlow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055289","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 June 1929","placeOfBirth":" Middlesbrough, North Riding, Yorkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Thelma Pigott","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Thelma Barlow (née Pigott) is an English television actress and writer, most famous for her roles as Mavis Wilton in the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street and as Dolly Bellfield in the sitcom Dinnerladies. Thelma Barlow was born in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the younger of two daughters. Her father, Tommy, a cabinet maker, died of pneumonia five weeks before her birth, and Barlow was brought up by her mother Margaret. During her childhood the family moved to Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire. Barlow left school at 15 and went to Huddersfield Technical College to study shorthand and typing. Her first job was as a secretary, which she held for eight years and at the same time belonged to an amateur dramatics group. Barlow decided to take up acting professionally and joined the Joan Littlewood Theatre Group. During the 1950s she did rep in Liverpool, Nottingham and Birmingham. In 1960 Barlow joined the West of England Theatre Company followed by the Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company. In Bristol she ran a boarding house for fellow actors. In 1956 she married set designer Graham Barlow; they subsequently had two children, Clive and James. They divorced in 1983. Thelma Barlow's first television appearance was in 1970's A Stranger on the Hill. The following year while performing in Liverpool she was asked to audition for the soap opera Coronation Street for the role of Mavis Riley. She was successful and her first episode was transmitted on 14 August 1971, though the character appeared regularly only from 1973, when she joined the staff of \"The Kabin\". Barlow remained in the series for 26 years, appearing in nearly 2,000 episodes, until she left after the departure of her on-screen husband Derek. Her final episode was broadcast 10 October 1997 when Mavis moved to the Lake District. During her time on Coronation Street Barlow shared a flat with co-star Helen Worth and later moved to Settle, where she later did a TV show from her garden. Barlow's next major role was that of Dolly Bellfield in Victoria Wood's sitcom Dinnerladies, which ran for two series from 1998 to 2000. Since her departure from Coronation Street Barlow has also made stage appearances. In June 2014, Barlow narrated 30-minute documentary \"Gail & Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street\" which celebrated Helen Worth's career on Coronation Street as Gail Platt.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055289","name":"Thelma Barlow","idIMDB":"nm0055289"},"actorId":"nm0055289","character":"Mrs Oscar Garmunder","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt4136084","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4136084","business":{"budget":{"money":"$29,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"$27,370,107","country":"USA","day":"23","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$27,321,247","country":"USA","day":"16","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$27,249,911","country":"USA","day":"09","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$27,154,455","country":"USA","day":"02","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$26,954,148","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"09","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$25,723,456","country":"USA","day":"11","month":"09","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$19,820,821","country":"USA","day":"28","month":"08","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$2,080,000","country":"USA","day":"12","month":"08","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"$2,080,000","country":"Worldwide","day":"12","month":"08","year":"2016","remarks":""},{"money":"€2,731,899","country":"Italy","day":"22","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":""},{"money":"€2,640,896","country":"Italy","day":"15","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":""},{"money":"€2,434,580","country":"Italy","day":"08","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":""},{"money":"€1,839,969","country":"Italy","day":"01","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":[{"money":"$20,032","country":"USA","day":"23","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":"33 Screens"},{"money":"$46,196","country":"USA","day":"16","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":"87 Screens"},{"money":"$43,122","country":"USA","day":"09","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":"72 Screens"},{"money":"$97,831","country":"USA","day":"02","month":"10","year":"2016","remarks":"128 Screens"},{"money":"$175,803","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"09","year":"2016","remarks":"235 Screens"},{"money":"$853,653","country":"USA","day":"11","month":"09","year":"2016","remarks":"1,062 Screens"},{"money":"$2,967,526","country":"USA","day":"28","month":"08","year":"2016","remarks":"1,324 Screens"},{"money":"€63,787","country":"Italy","day":"22","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":"44 Screens"},{"money":"€142,295","country":"Italy","day":"15","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":"89 Screens"},{"money":"€324,181","country":"Italy","day":"08","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":"134 Screens"},{"money":"€644,529","country":"Italy","day":"01","month":"01","year":"2017","remarks":"316 Screens"}],"admissions":[{"money":"87,949","country":"France","day":"26","month":"07","year":"2016","remarks":""}],"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[null,null],"copyrightHolder":"Pathé Productions Limited"},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 51 min (111 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color","Black and White (some footage)"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":["Arri Alexa XT, Panavision Primo and Angenieux Optimo Lenses"],"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["DCP"]},"rating":"6.9","metascore":"71","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Liverpool, Merseyside, England, UK"}],"rated":"PG-13","awards":[{"award":"Academy Awards, USA 2017","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Oscar","categories":[{"category":"Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role","names":[{"name":"Meryl Streep","id":"nm0000658","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Achievement in Costume Design","names":[{"name":"Consolata Boyle","id":"nm0102219","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Golden Globes, USA 2017","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Golden Globe","categories":[{"category":"Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy","names":[]},{"category":"Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy","names":[{"name":"Hugh Grant","id":"nm0000424","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy","names":[{"name":"Meryl Streep","id":"nm0000658","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture","names":[{"name":"Simon Helberg","id":"nm0374865","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"BAFTA Awards 2017","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won BAFTA Film Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Make Up/Hair","names":[{"name":"J.
