He has continued with a steady incline of intriguing roles ever since, following up in another Lions Gate release 'Psycho Ward', and the genre festival favorites, 'Dead Genesis' and 'If A Tree Falls'. Barrett then went on to play the role of the central character in the psychological thriller 'Neverlost' (Anchor Bay CAN/GEG U.S.), a role he received critical commendation for, as well as a 2011 Toronto International Film and Video Award (TIFVA) for Best Actor in a Feature. For his role in 'Neverlost\", Ry lost 50lbs to better suit the character, and is known for his dedication and physical commitment to each and every role he takes on. He has played a variety of roles demonstrating his dynamic range as an actor, from an optimistic but vulnerable jock in the thriller, 'I Choose Chaos' ; the iconic Stephen King character, Ace Merrill in the adaptation 'Love Never Dies', a talking newlywed zombie in the zombie comedy 'The Post-Lifers', to a disconnected rebel fighting zombies in Reese Eveneshen's 'Dead Genesis', and a man haunted by his past in the supernatural thriller 'Kingdom Come', to name a few. A born lover of cinema, long-time short story and song lyric writer, Barrett's interests quickly branched into screen-writing and producing. In summer of 2008, Barrett again teamed with director and friend Gabriel Carrer. He developed, wrote, produced and starred in the indie horror success 'If A Tree Falls', which premiered summer 2010 at the Fantasia Int. Film Festival and was released internationally in various formats. Barrett wrote the script to reflect present day sensibilities relevant to the standards of today's psychological thrillers and horror films, but to be executed in a style and tone of exploitation classics of the past. Ry has written, directed and produced numerous music videos, features and short films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MzE1NDY0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3ODgyNTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2028004","name":"Ry Barrett","idIMDB":"nm2028004"},"actorId":"nm2028004","character":"Chad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Eitan Shalmon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5716094","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNTI3ODk3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc2ODQ3NTE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Eitan Shalmon was born on August 30, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, to Yoram and Rachel Shalmon.
