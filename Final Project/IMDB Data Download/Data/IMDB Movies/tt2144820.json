While attending Buford High School, he also studied leadership training, debate, saxophone, and tennis. Robert's major changed in college from journalism to theater in pursuit of a strong desire to communicate both as an actor and designer. He landed his first lead role as Pippin at Georgia College. He also spent a summer working with the Lost Colony in Roanoke, North Carolina, America's longest running outdoor drama, written by Pulitzer Prize winning playwright, Paul Green. After graduating from the University of West Georgia with a Bachelor's degree in Speech and Theater, Robert worked as a freelance stage and lighting designer in addition to acting and directing dramas for several churches. After shelving his passion for acting and designing for a season of personal growth, Robert ultimately returned through the AMTC (Actors, Models, and Talent for Christ) on-camera training program. It was during this time that he performed for the award winning director and screenwriter, Michael McClendon, who soon cast Robert in his film debut principle role in the faith-based film \"Stand Your Ground\" (released in theaters 2014). This transition towards film also opened the doors for several independent film roles for him. In addition, Robert landed his first promo commercial for the cable station, Inspiration Networks, and voice over training narration for Chick-fil-A's corporate office. Robert resides in Atlanta, Georgia with his wife and their 4 children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDUwMDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE4OTQ0OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5081373","name":"Robert Thomason","idIMDB":"nm5081373"},"actorId":"nm5081373","character":"Ellis Burdette","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sherry Velvet Tatum","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5056350","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Sherry Velvet Tatum is an actress, known for Stand Your Ground (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5056350","name":"Sherry Velvet Tatum","idIMDB":"nm5056350"},"actorId":"nm5056350","character":"Debbie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ronny Mathew","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5053734","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Born and raised in the small town of Livingston, New Jersey.
