The younger Felmy grew up in Brunswick and first worked in the locksmiths and printing trades. Finding the arts more to his taste he joined a travelling theatrical troupe, afterwards taking acting classes. He made his stage debut in 1950 in Carl Zuckmayer's \"Des Teufels General\". His first screen roles were similarly in uniformed garb (paralleling the beginnings of fellow young actors Horst Frank and Joachim Hansen), in Der Stern von Afrika (1957) and UB 55, corsaire de l'océan (1957). Felmy had looks, a certain impudent charm and a fair share of acting ability. He fell into the anti-hero category at a time of 'angry young men', skepticism and the questioning of authority. He was fortunate to score as many high profile and challenging film roles as he could reasonably expect: La Muselière (1958), Wir Wunderkinder (1958), The Buddenbrooks (1959) and the beautifully filmed epic family saga Duel with Death (1959). Felmy consequently emerged as one of the most bankable and popular stars of the 1950's and early 60's. As the quality of German cinema began to decline, Felmy concentrated more on theatrical and dubbing work (notably for English-speaking stars like Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine). In pictures, he made his international debut in Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain (1966) and remained in the public consciousness playing conventional, dramatically undemanding leads in commercially successful Edgar Wallace potboilers like The Mad Executioners (1963) and Das Ungeheuer von London-City (1964). After a quiet spell of five years, Felmy's screen career was revived when he was signed by the WDR (Westdeutscher Rundfunk) to star as thoughtful police inspector Heinz Haferkamp in the long running TV series Tatort (1970). He played Haferkamp for six years, in the process becoming one of Germany's most popular TV actors. Felmy died from the effects of osteoporosis in August 2007 at the age of 76.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI4ZGQxMDUtNTFhNC00NWQxLThiNTQtNDNmMjI5NjdiZWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0271544","name":"Hansjörg Felmy","idIMDB":"nm0271544"},"actorId":"nm0271544","character":"Thomas Buddenbrook","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0113798","main":true},{"actorName":"Hanns Lothar","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0521438","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 April 1929","placeOfBirth":" Hannover, Germany","birthName":"Hanns Lothar Neutze","bio":"Hanns Lothar was born on April 10, 1929 in Hannover, Germany as Hanns Lothar Neutze.

Sent at the age of ten to Baden-Baden to study, she later entered the cinema thanks to her marriage in 1917 to the actor Fritz Dagover who was 25 years her senior. They divorced in 1919 but not before he had introduced her to director Robert Wiene and other notables of German cinema. She made her screen debut in Fritz Lang's Madame Butterfly (1919). Immediately after she appeared in Wiene's classic expressionist film, \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (aka The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920)). Apart from three trips -- one to Sweden in 1927, another to France in 1928-9 and one to Hollywood in 1931 -- most of Lil Dagover's career and fate was linked to that of the German cinema, where her role was usually that of the frail, menaced heroine. She continued to star in a great number of films during the Nazi era. Among her best performances were her roles in Le congrès s'amuse (1931), in Gerhard Lamprecht's The Higher Command (1935) and in Veit Harlan's The Kreutzer Sonata (1937). She also acted in the Deutsches Theatre Berlin, the Salzburg Festival, at forces shows and at war theaters. At one time, she was reported to have been a close friend of Adolf Hitler. In 1944, she received the War Merits Cross. Dagover continued her career in post-war Germany, playing many supporting parts until the late 1970s.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk0NjQ2NTUxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUxODY3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0196820","name":"Lil Dagover","idIMDB":"nm0196820"},"actorId":"nm0196820","character":"Elisabeth Buddenbrook","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0113806","main":true},{"actorName":"Werner Hinz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386076","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 January 1903","placeOfBirth":" Berlin, Germany","bio":"Werner Hinz was born on January 18, 1903 in Berlin, Germany.
