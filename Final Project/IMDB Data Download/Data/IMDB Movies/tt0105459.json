Hauer was born in Breukelen, a town in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands. He is the son of Teunke (Mellema) and Arend Hauer, both actors. Because his parents were often touring, he and his three sisters were raised by a nanny. A bit of a rebel during his childhood, he chafed at the rules and rigors of school and was often getting into mischief. His grandfather had been the captain of a schooner and at age 15, Hauer ran away to work on a freighter for a year. Like his great-grandfather, Hauer is color-blind, which prevented him from furthering his career as a sailor. Upon his return he attended night school and started working in the construction industry. When he again bombed at school, his parents enrolled him in drama classes. Fancying himself a poet, he spent most of his time writing poetry and hanging out in Amsterdam coffee houses instead of studying. He was expelled for poor attendance and afterward spent a brief period in the Dutch navy. Deciding he didn't like military life, he convinced his superiors that he was mentally unfit and was sent to a special home for psych patients. It was an unpleasant place, but Hauer remained there until he convinced his ranking officers that the military really did not need him.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY4MjI0MjgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0MDkyODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000442","name":"Rutger Hauer","nicknames":["The Dutch Paul Newman"],"idIMDB":"nm0000442"},"actorId":"nm0000442","character":"Harley Stone","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0162474","main":true},{"actorName":"Kim Cattrall","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000326","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NjMyMjAyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1ODQ5MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 August 1956","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, England, UK","birthName":"Kim Victoria Cattrall","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Kim Victoria Cattrall was born on August 21, 1956 in Mossley Hill, Liverpool, England to Gladys Shane (Baugh), a secretary, and Dennis Cattrall, a construction engineer.

Growing up in Warrington, Lancashire amid middle-class surroundings, he went to college and while completing his studies developed an interest in theatre, to the chagrin of his family. His father, a laborer, wanted him to find a more secure position in life. A drama teacher initially, he decided to follow his acting instincts full-time and gradually built up an impressive array of classical stage credits via repertory, including the Bristol Old Vic Drama School, and in stints with Liverpool Everyman, Machester Royal Exchange and the Royal Shakespeare Company. By the 80s he was ready to branch out into film and TV, giving a startling performance as a wife abuser in the British film Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988). His highly distinctive features were subsequently put to good use in a number of versatile roles, usually menacing but sometimes humble, and most frequently as working-class types. By 1993 he had crossed over into Hollywood parts and earned his first Oscar nomination for his superb role as Daniel Day-Lewis' father in Au nom du père (1993). Other quality roles came his way with The Usual Suspects (1995), Brassed Off (1996), and Amistad (1997). Television has been a creative and positive venue as well with fine work in Sharpe's Company (1994), Lost for Words (1999) and The Sins (2000). Postlethwaite worked equally both in the UK and abroad, and avoided the public limelight for the most part, living quietly in England. Postlethwaite continued on in films with roles in The Shipping News (2001), The Limit (2004), Dark Water (2005), The Omen (2006), Ghost Son (2007) and Solomon Kane (2009). 2010 was a banner film year for the actor with roles in the popular and/or highly acclaimed films Clash of the Titans (2010), Inception (2010) and The Town (2010). Married and the father of two, Postlewaite died on January 2, 2011, at age 64, following a recurrence of the cancer he had battled two decades earlier.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMjIxMTQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQ0NTE1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000592","name":"Pete Postlethwaite","idIMDB":"nm0000592"},"actorId":"nm0000592","character":"Paulsen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0162475","main":true},{"actorName":"Ian Dury","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244443","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 May 1942","placeOfBirth":" Harrow, Middlesex, England, UK","bio":"Ian Dury had to face polio at the age of 7, and consequently a string of institutions over the next few years.
