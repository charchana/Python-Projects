His father was a United Nations diplomat assigned to Switzerland and, as a result, Chris was educated at private boarding schools in Geneva. Inspired through his having appeared in a play at age 12, he went to the Paris Conservatoire where he remained for two years. After a few small parts in French films, beginning in 1980, he successfully competed for the title role in Warner Bros. Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984). His co-stars included Ian Holm, James Fox and Ralph Richardson (in his final film performance). The movie was popular with Tarzan buffs for remaining faithful (in the first half at least) to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original story. Two years later Lambert brought to the screen Gregory Widens' legendary Connor MacLeod, the immortal Highlander (1986), born in the Highlands of Scotland in 1518 and carrying over into the futuristic Highlander II: The Quickening (1991) and Highlander: The Final Dimension (1994). In recent years he has become a producer while continuing to act in mostly action/adventure films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY0NjQ1Mjc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUzMDc2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000483","name":"Christopher Lambert","nicknames":["Chris"],"idIMDB":"nm0000483"},"actorId":"nm0000483","character":"Beowulf","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0030132","main":true},{"actorName":"Rhona Mitra","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0593961","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNzM4NzE1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc2NzU5MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 August 1976","placeOfBirth":" Paddington, London, England, UK","birthName":"Rhona Natasha Mitra","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Mitra was born in Paddington, London, England, the daughter of Nora Downey and Anthony Mitra, a cosmetic surgeon.

She was raised by her parents, both of whom were educators, in a third world country. Needless to say, Patricia's life was far from luxurious. She attended San Vicente de Paul High School, and after her graduation in 1987, headed for college to study engineering and accounting. Although she was being raised to go into the Venezuelan oil industry (which is basically the only choice for Native American children from Venezuela), a chance event led her to switch plans. A friend of hers wanted to become a model, and one of the pictures she sent to a casting call in Caracas included Patricia. As fate would have it, the agency wanted exotic Patricia. After a year of college studies, she left for Milan in pursuit of a modeling career. In 1998, she strutted down catwalks in ready-to-wear fashion shows for designers such as Antonio Berardi, Bella Freud, Corinne Cobson, Claude Montana and Dolce & Gabana, to name a few. As for print, Patricia appeared in ads for Chanel's Allure, Roberto Verino's Verino fragrance, as well as Victoria's Secret. She even donned swimsuits for Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Edition in 1994 at the age of 23. She has participated in the mother of all beauty pageants, the Miss Venezuela pageant, and can be seen in such movies as The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001). Patricia has tried and succeeded in branching out from the stereotype of a model. Besides, she has more noble reasons for her very full schedule. She grew up in a very poor family in Guajira, and promised herself that she would get her family out of that situation. After her first few modeling gigs, she bought her family a new home, made sure her 3 brothers received a college education, and still supports causes such as the advancement of Hispanics, fair treatment of indigenous peoples, and the fight against pediatric AIDS. She also launched a foundation to help Venezuelans.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MzY4NzI2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU4Mjc3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0892383","name":"Patricia Velasquez","idIMDB":"nm0892383"},"actorId":"nm0892383","character":"Pendra","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marcel Cobzariu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168036","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Marcel Cobzariu is an actor, known for Beowulf (1999), Catacombs (2007) and California Dreamin' (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168036","name":"Marcel Cobzariu","idIMDB":"nm0168036"},"actorId":"nm0168036","character":"Lookout","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Vlad Jipa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423160","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Vlad Jipa is an actor, known for Beowulf (1999), Strigoi (2009) and Des Escargots et des Hommes (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0423160","name":"Vlad Jipa","idIMDB":"nm0423160"},"actorId":"nm0423160","character":"Sentry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Diana Dumbrava","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0241519","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1967","placeOfBirth":" Bacau, Romania","bio":"Diana Dumbrava was born in 1967 in Bacau, Romania.
