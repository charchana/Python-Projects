Six years later, Ryuhei's life took a tragic turn when his father, at the age of 40, died from bladder cancer. Ryuhei and his mother persevered, and unlike most offspring of famous actors, he didn't give much thought to acting as a child. Nine years later, at the age of 15, that would all change when Ryuhei was approached by Nagisa Oshima with a life changing offer: to take on the prominent role as the androgynous youth, Samurai Sozaburo Kano in the controversial Gohatto. Ryuhei took the role head on, preparing himself emotionally and physically by practicing ken do for two months straight. His film debut was a success, and acted on par with the likes of Takeshi Kitano and Tadanobu Asano. For his hard work, Ryuhei was rewarded with critical acclaim and numerous awards. Shortly thereafter, he dropped out of high school to fully devote his time and efforts on his burgeoning film career, and with much success. Lightning would strike again for Ryuhei in 2001, in the dark, thought provoking high school drama, Blue Spring, directed by Toshiaki Toyoda. Such as with his debut, Ryuhei received yet more acclaim and this time, more widespread recognition for his role as the laid back, brutal, yet introspective high school gang leader, Kujo. The film roles kept coming, such as the 2003 reunion with writer director Toshiaki Toyoda in the acclaimed film 9 Souls, and a bit part in the flashy, comedic anime-to-film live action adaptation of Cutie Honey in the following year. Ryuhei's trend of working with some of Japan's most talented actors and directors continued in 2004 and in 2005 in the violent Takashi Miike action film, Izo, co-starring Takeshi Kitano and the up-coming Ranpo jigoku, co-starring Tadanobu Asano. With his charisma, talent, and ability to take on roles varying from the comedic, outrageous, moving, and controversial, the sky's the limit for this young man.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MTU2MTI3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU1ODEzMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0559430","name":"Ryûhei Matsuda","idIMDB":"nm0559430"},"actorId":"nm0559430","character":"Kujo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hirofumi Arai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1078422","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 January 1979","placeOfBirth":" Hirosaki, Japan","birthName":"Kyung-Sik Park","height":"5' 11¼\" (1.81 m)","bio":"Hirofumi Arai was born on January 18, 1979 in Hirosaki, Japan as Kyung-Sik Park.
