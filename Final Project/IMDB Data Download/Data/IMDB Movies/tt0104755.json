He was the youngest of four children having two older brothers and one older sister. His early education was at the New Method College or the Sun Fat College. After graduation and having armed himself with a degree in Chinese History, Alan entered the teaching profession of Chinese History. His first starring role was actually at age 16 in a 1964 movie called The Student Prince. He got this role after some school friends showed his picture to the people making a movie at their secondary school. His role in this early movie earned the nickname of \"The Prince.\" In the 1970s it was reported that Tang made a salary of HK$150,000 per picture because he was so popular. In one 1974 article Alan Tang said that he was working on six movies at same time. Tang said, however, that he only worked on one film a day and that made it difficult for producers. In 1974, Tang not only starred in the Splendid Love in Winter with Chen Chen but also produced it. He talks about being so tired from working on his businesses that he could barely talk to Janet when he returned home at night. In another case, Tang describes having insomnia when he was separated from Janet. He was filming in Taiwan and Janet was in Hong Kong. It is no wonder then that the pair had occasional difficulties especially since the press reported their every move. It is a tribute to their love that Alan and Janet have remained together all these years in spite of living under constant scrutiny. He found his main fame though when he moved to Taiwan and made many dramas and romances - often pairing off with Brigitte Lin during the 70s, in such films as Run Lover Run. Tang made over 60 films in Taiwan. Later after his star faded a bit, he began producing films - two of them the Wong Kar-wai films As Tears Go By and Days of Being Wild. He still appeared in a number of films - generally of the triad genre - such as Flaming Brothers, Gangland Odyssey, Return Engagement, Gun N' Rose and The Black Panther Warriors.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0849257","name":"Alan Tang","nicknames":["The Prince"],"idIMDB":"nm0849257"},"actorId":"nm0849257","character":"Alan Lung","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Leon Lai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0481709","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NjY1NDk1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAwMDkyMg@@._V1_UY44_CR14,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 December 1966","placeOfBirth":" Beijing, China","birthName":"Alexander Lai Chit","height":"5' 11½\" (1.81 m)","bio":"Leon Lai won the 2002 Taiwan Golden Horse Award for Best Actor for his outstanding performance in the highly acclaimed horror film, Three, where he portrayed an obsessive husband trying to revive his dead wife with Chinese medicine.
