She had appeared in B-movie thrillers with Jean Gabin and Ascenseur was in that genre. The technicians at the film lab went to the producer after seeing the first week of dailies for Ascenseur and said: \"You must not let Malle destroy Jeanne Moreau\". Malle explained: \"She was lit only by the windows of the Champs Elysées. That had never been done. Cameramen would have forced her to wear a lot of make-up and they would put a lot of light on her, because, supposedly, her face was not photogenic\". This lack of artifice revealed Moreau's \"essential qualities: she could be almost ugly and then ten seconds later she would turn her face and would be incredibly attractive. But she would be herself\". Moreau has told interviewers that the characters she played were not her. But even the most famous film critic of his generation, Roger Ebert, thinks that she is a lot like her most enduring role, Catherine in François Truffaut's Jules and Jim (1962). Behind those eyes and that enigmatic smile is a woman with a mind. In a review of Screen Two: The Clothes in the Wardrobe (1993) Ebert wrote: \"Jeanne Moreau has been a treasure of the movies for 35 years... Here, playing a flamboyant woman who nevertheless keeps her real thoughts closely guarded, she brings about a final scene of poetic justice as perfect as it is unexpected\". Moreau made her debut as a director in Lumiere (1976) -- also writing the script and playing Sarah, an actress the same age as Moreau whose romances are often with directors for the duration of making a film. She made several films with Malle. Still active in international cinema, Moreau presided over the jury of the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY4MTY5MTE3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3MDQyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0603402","name":"Jeanne Moreau","nicknames":["The French Bette Davis"],"idIMDB":"nm0603402"},"actorId":"nm0603402","character":"Le Doria","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacqueline Maillan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537571","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 January 1923","placeOfBirth":" Paray-le-Monial, Saône-et-Loire, France","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Exuberant, excessive, bursting with energy, a regular comic whirlwind, Jacqueline Maillan made two generations of French people laugh. Which is paradoxical because when she arrived in Paris at the age of twenty-one and joined René Simon's dramatic school she saw herself as a tragedian. But her rendition of Racine's \"Athalie\" had an unexpected effect on the other students: instead of wringing their hands under the terror and the pity inherent in tragedy ... they split their sides laughing. Jacqueline Maillan understood the lesson and said farewell to tragedy forever. And she was quite right: she was really wonderful in light comedies such as \"Folle Amanda\", \"La Facture\", Madame Sans-Gêne\" and many others. She was also part of memorable crazy comic revues like \"Ah! les belles bacchantes\" and even performed in musical comedies (\"Féfé de Broadway\"). But she was mainly one of the first women to appear in one-man (or rather woman) shows when the genre was male-dominated. Compared to these triumphs, her film career is a bit disappointing. For all her talent, Jacqueline Maillan was never given a memorable role in a memorable movie. When she WAS in a masterpiece (\"Les grandes manoeuvres\") her role was tiny while when she starred, for instance in Pierre Mondy's \"Appelez-moi Mathilde\", the result was appalling. She was irresistible though as the scatterbrained wife of Louis de Funès's in 'Pouic Pouic' and as the patriotic mother in Jean-Marie Poiré's spoof \"Papy fait de la résistance\". In the last stage of her career she also fitted rather well with Jean-Pierre Mocky's wild and caustic world.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537571","name":"Jacqueline Maillan","idIMDB":"nm0537571"},"actorId":"nm0537571","character":"Edma Bautet-Lebrêche","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"André Dussollier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244707","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NjE4OTMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc4NTUzOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1946","placeOfBirth":" Annecy, Haute-Savoie, France","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"André Dussollier was born on February 17, 1946 in Annecy, Haute-Savoie, France.
