Dyanne was born on October 14, 1943, in Greenwich, Connecticut, and grew up in New Jersey and New Zealand. She gave her first performance at age three in a church play. She studied acting in New York with Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg. Dyanne made her film debut with a minor role as a college student in the comedy film Who Was That Lady? (1960). She was especially impressive as a kinky swinger in Joseph W. Sarno's sensational softcore gem Sin in the Suburbs (1964). She had a small role as a cocktail waitress in the groovy satire The President's Analyst (1967). Other memorable roles include the bumbling Fairy Godmother in the bawdy Pinocchio (1971), an alluring witch in the steamy Blood Sabbath (1972), a faithless wife in the tawdry Point of Terror (1971), a hooker in the crude Wam Bam Thank You Spaceman (1975), one of the titular lovely ladies in the wild The Swinging Barmaids (1975), a crazy asylum inmate in the tacky Hellhole (1985) and Jim Belushi's aggressively flirtatious transsexual father in the amusing deadpan hoot Real Men (1987). Dyanne did guest spots on the television series Naked City (1958), The Felony Squad (1966), Star Trek (1966), Car 54, Where Are You? (1961), T.H.E. Cat (1966) and The Wackiest Ship in the Army (1965). Outside of her film and television work, Thorne has also performed in Broadway road tours and done comedy on the Las Vegas stage (she starred in her own popular comedy revue called \"Sex Over 40\"). In real life, she's the total radical opposite of her cruel and formidable screen persona: She's a very kind and sweet woman who's an ordained minister and co-founder of the International Science of Mind Prayer Circle and runs her own private wedding chapel service with her actor/musician husband Howard Maurer in Las Vegas, Nevada.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0246814","name":"Dyanne Thorne","idIMDB":"nm0246814"},"actorId":"nm0246814","character":"Greta","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tania Busselier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124449","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 June 1946","placeOfBirth":" Charlieu, Loire, France","birthName":"Andrée Busselier","bio":"Tania Busselier was born on June 29, 1946 in Charlieu, Loire, France as Andrée Busselier.

Romay was born Rosa Maria Almirall on June 25, 1954, in Barcelona, Cataluna, Spain. Her cinematic pseudonym was taken from a singer/actress in mambo king Xavier Cugat's band in the 1940s. Following graduation from high school, Romay studied the arts, married actor/photographer Raymond Hardy (they later divorced), and began acting in stage productions. Lina first met infamous and prolific maverick Spanish independent filmmaker Jesús Franco in the early 1970s. Romay and Franco eventually became a couple. Lina for a long time was Franco's common law wife until they officially wed on April 23, 2008. Lina made her film debut as a gypsy girl in The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein (1973). She had small parts in a few other Franco films before playing more substantial lead and co-starring roles (she acted in over 100 Franco films). Despite her lack of formal training, Lina nonetheless naturally projected an extremely brazen, earthy, and uninhibited screen presence that was both alluring and captivating in equal measure. In fact, her open, unabashed, and downright aggressive sexuality even led to her willing and enthusiastic participation in explicit scenes in hardcore porno fare. Lina's most memorable roles include the voracious Countess Irina Karlstein in Female Vampire (1975), brutalized innocent Maria in the sensationally sleazy Barbed Wire Dolls (1976), vicious top con Juana in the similarly scuzzy Wanda, the Wicked Warden (1977), especially inspired in a dual part in Le portrait de Doriana Gray (1976) and bawdy prostitute Marika in the gloomy Jack l'éventreur (1976). Moreover, Romay posed for nude pictorials in such men's magazines as \"Cinema X\" and \"Sex Stars System.\" In addition to acting, Lina also worked on a handful of films as a writer, director, producer, and assistant editor. In real life Lina was the total radical opposite of her wild and outrageous screen persona: she was a very quiet, soft-spoken, and self-effacing woman who usually dressed in frumpy clothes. Romay died from cancer at age 57 on February 15, 2012 in Malaga, Spain.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxOTIyNTA5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTkzMTcy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0739124","name":"Lina Romay","nicknames":["R.M.

After the Spanish Civil War he was able to continue his studies at the Real Conservatorio de Madrid, where he finished piano and harmony. Being a Bachelor of Law and an easy-read novel writer (under the pseudonym David Khume), he signed on to enter the Instituto de Investigaciones y Experiencias Cinematográicas (IIEC), where he stayed for only two years, while he worked simultaneously as a director and theater actor. Later he went to Paris to study directing techniques at the I.D.H.E.C. (University of Sorbonne), where he used to go into seclusion for hours to watch films at the film archive. Back in Spain he began rted his huge cinematographic work as a composer, with Comiques (1954) and El hombre que viajaba despacito (1957), and later worked as an assistant director to Juan Antonio Bardem, León Klimovsky, Luis Saslavsky, Julio Bracho, Fernando Soler and Joaquín Luis Romero Marchent, among others. He also worked at Ágata Films S.A. as production manager and writer. His first works as a director were industrial and cultural short films. However, he soon applied all his knowledge and experience to his feature directorial debut, We Are 18 Years Old (1959). From that moment on all his work was supported by co-production. His Succubus (1968) was nominated for the Festival of Berlin, and this event gave him an international reputation. His career got more and more consolidated in the following years, and his endless creativity enabled him to tackle films in all genres, from \"B\" horror films to pure hardcore sex films. His productions have always been low-budget, but he nevertheless managed to work extraordinarily quickly, often releasing several titles at the same time, using the same shots in more than one film. Some of his actors relate how they they were hired for one film and later saw their name in two or more different ones. As the Spanish cinema evolved, Jesús managed to adapt to the new circumstances and always maintained a constant activity, activity that gave a place in his films to a whole filming crew. Apart from his own production company, Manacoa Films, he also worked for companies like Auster Films S.L. (Paul Auster), Cinematográfica Fénix Films (Arturo Marcos), the French Comptoir Français du Film (Robert de Nesle), Eurociné (Daniel Lesoeur and Marius Lesoeur), Elite Films Productions (Erwin C. Dietrich), Spain's Fervi Films (Fernando Vidal Campos) or Golden Films Internacional S.A. He acted in almost all of his films, playing musicians, lawyers, porters and others, all of them sinister, manic and comic characters. Among the aliases he used--apart from Jesús Franco, Jess Franco or Franco Manera--were Jess Frank, Robert Zimmerman, Frank Hollman, Clifford Brown, David Khune, Frarik Hollman, Toni Falt, James P. Johnson, Charlie Christian, David Tough, Cady Coster, Lennie Hayden, Lulú Laverne and Betty Carter. Lina Romay has been almost a constant in his films, and it's very probable that in some of them she has been credited as the director instead of him. In many of the more than 180 films he's directed he has also worked as composer, writer, cinematographer and editor. His influence has been notable all over Europe (he even contacted producer Roger Corman in the US). From his huge body of work we can deduce that Jesús Franco is one of the most restless directors of Spanish cinema. Many of his films have had problems in getting released, and others have been made directly for video. His work is often a do-it-yourself effort. More than once his staunchest supporters have found his \"new\" films to contain much footage from one or more of his older ones. Jesús Franco is a survivor in a time when most of his colleagues tried to please the government censors. He broke with all that and got the independence he was seeking. He always went upstream in an ephemeral industry that fed opportunists and curbed the activity of many professionals. Jess Franco died in Malaga, Spain, on April 2, 2013, of a stroke.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzODY1MjQ1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDg2NDEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001238","name":"Jesús Franco","nicknames":["Tío Jess"],"idIMDB":"nm0001238"},"actorId":"nm0001238","character":"Dr. Milton Arcos","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dagmar Bürger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0127303","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Dagmar Bürger is an actress, known for Le cabaret des filles perverses (1977), Wanda, the Wicked Warden (1977) and Helga, fille esclave (1977).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0127303","name":"Dagmar Bürger","idIMDB":"nm0127303"},"actorId":"nm0127303","character":"No. 9","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lorli Bucher","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0118146","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Lorli Bucher is an actress, known for Wanda, the Wicked Warden (1977) and Jack l'éventreur (1976).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0118146","name":"Lorli Bucher","idIMDB":"nm0118146"},"actorId":"nm0118146","character":"Wardress","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sandra L.
