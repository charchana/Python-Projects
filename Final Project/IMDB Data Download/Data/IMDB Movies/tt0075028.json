First debuted on-screen as a moody Native American in Chief Crazy Horse (1955) and regularly guest-starred in many 1950s TV shows including Playhouse 90 (1956), Wagon Train (1957), and 77 Sunset Strip (1958)...often as a gunslinger or a slippery criminal. Danton found plenty of demand for his talents and appeared in several minor films including The Night Runner (1957), Tarawa Beachhead (1958), in which he starred with his wife, Julie Adams, and then as a serial rapist in The Beat Generation (1959). However, his most well remembered role was as the vicious prohibition gangster Jack Diamond in the superb The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond (1960) also starring a young Warren Oates and directed by Budd Boetticher. Danton reprised his Legs Diamond role only a year later in the unrelated, and not as enjoyable Portrait of a Mobster (1961). Cornering the market on playing shady characters, Danton then portrayed troubled actor George Raft in The George Raft Story (1961), but he was back on the side of good in 1962 playing an Allied officer at the invasion of Normandy in The Longest Day (1962). Europe then beckoned for the virile Danton, and like many other young US actors in the early 1960s, he made several films in Italy and Spain between 1964 and 1969 with a mixture of success. Danton returned to the USA in the early 1970s and appeared in several other low budget features; however, he also turned his hand to direction and his first film was the AIP production of Deathmaster (1972) starring Robert Quarry who was riding high on the success of the Count Yorga vampire films. Danton directed another couple of minor horror films before becoming involved in television and directing episodes of some of the most popular TV series of the 1970/80s including Quincy M.E. (1976), The Incredible Hulk (1978), Magnum, P.I. (1980) and Cagney & Lacey (1981). His final directorial work was on the TV series Vietnam War Story (1987) in 1987. Danton passed away in 1992 from kidney failure aged only 61.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3OTYwMjg2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk5MjgwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0200645","name":"Ray Danton","idIMDB":"nm0200645"},"actorId":"nm0200645","character":"Derek Flint","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0025045","main":true},{"actorName":"Sharon Acker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009943","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1Nzg5NTY3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQzMDI0MTI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 April 1935","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","bio":"Although she was presented in 1969 the first Film Star of Tomorrow by The Motion Picture Exhibitors of Canada, the status of Sharon Acker as a star never materialized. Not that she was inactive, quite the opposite, but she worked almost only for TV and appeared only in a few undistinguished movie films. She will, nevertheless, remain remembered for her role as Lee Marvin's ex-wife in John Boorman's classic film noir Point Blank (1967). The victim of Marvin's rough manners, Acker/Lynne left a deep impact on male brains. Born in 1935, the Canadian-born actress started her film career in England when the play she was in, \"Lucky Jim\", Kingsley Amis' classic, was made into a movie. But, she was not seen in many a film, except during the sixties, either in Canada or in the U.S. On the contrary, she has been very active on TV, first in Canada from the age of 19, then in the U.S. in made-for-TV movies or series like Star Trek (1966), Mission: Impossible (1966), Gunsmoke (1955), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969), Barnaby Jones (1973), etc. She was a regular in the series The Bold Ones: The Senator (1970) for one year and played \"Della Street\" in the short-lived The New Perry Mason (1973). A talented actress seen too little in movie theaters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1Nzg5NTY3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQzMDI0MTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009943","name":"Sharon Acker","idIMDB":"nm0009943"},"actorId":"nm0009943","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lawrence Dane","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199325","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzIxNTk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyMzgwOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 April 1937","placeOfBirth":" Masson, Quebec, Canada","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Lawrence Dane is an exceptionally fine, versatile and shamefully underrated Canadian character actor who's equally adept at both comedy and drama alike. Tall and lean, with silver gray hair, a gaunt face and a distinguished air about him, Dane is often cast as smooth business executives, physicians, police officers and stern authority figures. Born on April 3 in 1937 in Masson, Quebec, Lawrence grew up in Ottawa and initially took acting lessons in order to overcome shyness. Dane first started acting in the early 1960's. He soon amassed a substantial volume of film and TV show credits. Lawrence gave an especially terrific performance as one of five doctors who find themselves being terrorized by vicious vengeful hillbillies when they go camping in the remote Canadian wilderness in the harrowing Deliverance (1972) variant The Creeper (1977); the multi-talented Dane also produced this gritty and suspenseful cult favorite thriller. Other notable roles Dane has played are Michael Ironside's evil business partner in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981), Melissa Sue Anderson's father in the superior slasher item Happy birthday, souhaitez ne jamais être invité (1981) and Peter Weller's tough, but fair boss in the excellent killer rat knockout D'origine inconnue (1983). Moreover, Dane displayed a delightful flair for comedy in the amusing features It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time (1975) and Find the Lady (1976), in which he was nicely paired with a then-unknown John Candy. Now in his late 70s, Lawrence Dane still continues to act in both TV shows and movies with pleasing regularity.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzIxNTk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyMzgwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199325","name":"Lawrence Dane","idIMDB":"nm0199325"},"actorId":"nm0199325","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Donnelly Rhodes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722413","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODkyNDUxMzQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUwODYxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 December 1937","placeOfBirth":" Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","birthName":"Donnelly Rhodes Henry","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada, Donnelly Rhodes trained to be a warden in the National Park Service in Manitoba and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force as an airman-mechanic before finally settling into his long and successful career as an actor. Rhodes studied at the Manitoba Theatre Center and was a member of the first graduating class of the National Theatre School in Canada. After making his professional debut on stage as Stanley Kowalski in Streetcar Named Desire, he became a contract player for Universal Pictures in the U.S., landing film and television roles ranging from a gunslinger in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) to a country singer in The Hard Part Begins (1973) to various guest appearances in series such as Mission: Impossible (1966). Later, he was popular as the suave Phillip Chancellor Sr. on The Young and the Restless (1973), but left the show in 1976 to avoid devoting too much of his career to the one role. He continued to work steadily, taking roles in a wide variety of television and theatrical movies and making guest appearances on more than 100 television series. Major TV roles saw him range from dim-witted escaped con Dutch on Soap (1977) to veterinarian and family man Dr. Grant Roberts on the popular Canadian family series Cap danger (1984). More recently, he has appeared in a number of TV movies as well as in guest spots on popular series such as Sliders (1995) and The X-Files (1993). Rhodes' diverse interests include music and horses, but his real passion is boats. He has said that if he hadn't succeeded as an actor, he would have pursued a career as a naval architect.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODkyNDUxMzQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUwODYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722413","name":"Donnelly Rhodes","idIMDB":"nm0722413"},"actorId":"nm0722413","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gay Rowan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746401","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1948","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","bio":"Gay Rowan was born in 1948 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
