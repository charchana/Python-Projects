Director Valerio Zurlini engaged the talented young actor for his Family Portrait (1962) as Marcello Mastroianni's brother. Jacques Perrin's longtime work with Director 'Constantin Costa-Gavras' started with Compartiment tueurs (1965) and Un homme à moitié (1966) in which he had played the sensible heroes. For Costa-Gavras' Z (1969) he played a main part and was the producer. Jacques Perrin has played often in famous romantic movies by Jacques Demy beside Catherine Deneuve and in social-critic-movies like La fête à Jules (1973) beside Claude Jade, for which he was co-producer too with his Reggane Productions. One of his memorable later roles is the adult Salvatore as movie-director in Cinema Paradiso (1988). In Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) he plays the older Thomas.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMzMzNDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzMwODc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0674742","name":"Jacques Perrin","idIMDB":"nm0674742"},"actorId":"nm0674742","character":"Récitant / Narrator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kristin Scott Thomas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000218","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc2MjQ1MzE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU4NDU1OQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1960","placeOfBirth":" Redruth, Cornwall, England, UK","birthName":"Kristin Ann Scott Thomas","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Kristin Scott Thomas was born in Redruth, Cornwall, England, to Deborah (Hurlbatt) and Lieutenant Commander Simon Scott Thomas.
