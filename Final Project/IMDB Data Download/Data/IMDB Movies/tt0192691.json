One of those \"eccentrics of the French Cinema\" as Raymond Chirat and Olivier Barrot quite rightly dubbed them. One of these wonderful personalities of the stage and screen who alongside Michel Simon, Louis Jouvet, Saturnin Fabre, Raimu and several others have such a strong personality, such a personal style that they are absolutely inimitable. Just like the actors mentioned above, André Lefaur was first and foremost André Lefaur. Which does not mean that he did not make the character he played believable. Quite the contrary. But like Simon, Brasseur or Raimu, he made them bigger than life and- accordingly - unforgettable. It is to be noted that on the big screen was most of the time a nobleman (at lest twenty times: six times a marquis, four times a baron) and/or a figure of authority (four times a general, but also a colonel, a judge or a president). However, instead of causing the viewer to admire these figures of the elite, Lefaur invariably deflated the ego of those pompous empty windbags. Yes, André Lefaur was nearly always cast as a v.i.p. but this person was invariably starchy, tyrannical ('La Fleur d'Oranger'), weak, pretentious, ridiculous ('La Dixième Symphonie') or cuckolded ('L'Habit Vert'). On the other hand, he never made puppets of his characters. There was always humanity within them and the viewer tended to end up feeling sorry for them rather than despise them. Marc Allégret allowed Lefaur to display all his humanity in his final role, that of a loving father in 'Les Petites du Quai aux Fleurs'), which was a nice farewell present to a man who will always be remembered for his ability to deliver witty lines by Louis Verneuil, Mirande, Deval, Flers and Caillavet like nobody else.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498833","name":"André Lefaur","idIMDB":"nm0498833"},"actorId":"nm0498833","character":"Le général Mikhaïl Ouratieff","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0212483","main":true},{"actorName":"Marguerite Deval","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0222165","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1866","placeOfBirth":" Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, France","birthName":"Marguerite Brulfer de Valcourt","bio":"Marguerite Deval was born on September 19, 1866 in Strasbourg, Bas-Rhin, France as Marguerite Brulfer de Valcourt.

Indeed, between 1930 and 1950, the popular character actor divided his performances between the Army, the Church and the Nobility. In the seventy-odd films he was in, he was in turns, captain (once in the army, the other time in the navy), the commander of a dragoon company, a colonel ; a baron (twice), a viscount, a count, a marquis, the King's tax collector and even, in the forgettable Aloha, le chant des îles (1937) , a Scottish lord (not his best role!) ; a priest, and even Saint Peter! He could also easily portray officials or people with an influential role in society : a doctor (twice), a politician, managers of various kinds, industrialists (he was already one in his first and only silent Amour et carburateur (1925), mayors, a financier, a couturier... His roundness could have suggested gentleness, but it is rather Monsieur Prudhomme, Henry Monnier's famous caricature character, that producers saw in him, the prototype of the plump, conformist, sententious, selfish bourgeois. For most of the characters played by Alerme are either unpleasant or ridiculous or both. The role epitomizing this type of character was the unforgettable pompous but cowardly mayor of a Flemish city in Jacques Feyder's classic Carnival in Flanders (1935). Alerme, although nearly always very good, has never been better than in this unparalleled masterpiece. André Alerme had been born in Dieppe in 1877 and started studying medicine and sculpture, but irresistibly attracted by theater, he soon appeared on the Paris theater scene. It did not take long before he met with success in plays by Henri Bernstein, Alfred Savoir, 'Edouard Bourdet', Jean Anouilh, Marcel Achard and many others. His passage from the boards to the studio spotlights was marked by the role of Georges Samoy he played in Sacha Guitry's Le blanc et le noir (1931) and reprised in Robert Florey's film version. Combining stage and cinema work in the early thirties, André Alerme tended to privilege the seventh art after 1936. Most of the films he participated in were just commercial but a few remain, signed by Jacques Feyder, Julien Duvivier, Georg Wilhelm Pabst, Abel Gance, Claude Autant-Lara, Edmond T. Gréville. A great actor, Alerme will forever remain Joseph Prudhomme, complete with pomp and wicked foolishness.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0018091","name":"André Alerme","idIMDB":"nm0018091"},"actorId":"nm0018091","character":"Arbeziah","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0212490","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0192691","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0192691","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 40 min (100 min) (France)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.1","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[{"award":"Venice Film Festival 1935","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Mussolini Cup","categories":[{"category":"Best Foreign Film","names":[{"name":"Jacques Deval","id":"nm0222164","role":null},{"name":"Germain Fried","id":"nm0294951","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"28","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0346381","name":"Productions Cinégraphiques Jacques Deval"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["based on play"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:33:13"}}
