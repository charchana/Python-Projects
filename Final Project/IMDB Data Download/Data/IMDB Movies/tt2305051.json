She is the second child of Mary Elizabeth \"Betty\" (Reese) and Dr. John Draper Witherspoon, Sr. Her father was a military surgeon specializing in ear, nose and throat. Her mother was a Registered Nurse who later became a Ph.D in pediatric nursing. Reese spent the first four years of her life in Wiesbaden, Germany, where her father served as a lieutenant colonel in the US Army reserves. Shortly after, John moved the family back to the States, settling in Nashville, Tennessee. Reese was introduced to the entertainment industry at a very early age. At age 7, she began modeling. This led to appearances on several local television commercials. At age 11, she placed first in a Ten-State Talent Fair. In 1990, she landed her first major acting role in Robert Mulligan's The Man in the Moon (1991). Her role as a 14-year old tomboy earned her rave reviews. Roles in bigger films such as Jack the Bear (1993) and A Far Off Place (1993) followed shortly after. Following high school graduation in 1994 from Harpeth Hall, a Nashville all girls school, Reese decided to put her acting career on hold and attend Stanford University where she would major in English literature. However, her collegiate plans were shortly dashed when she accepted roles to star in two major motion pictures: Fear (1996) alongside Mark Wahlberg and Freeway (1996) with Kiefer Sutherland. Although neither film was a huge box-office success, they did help to establish Reese as a rising starlet in Hollywood and open the door for bigger and better film roles. Those bigger roles came in movies such as Pleasantville (1998), Election (1999) and Cruel Intentions (1999). Her breakthrough role came as Elle Woods in the 2001 comedy Legally Blonde (2001). The movie was huge box-office smash and established Reese as one of the top female draws in Hollywood. The next year, she scored a follow-up hit with Sweet Home Alabama (2002) which went on to gross over $100 million dollars at the box office. In 2006, she took home the best actress Oscar for her role as June Carter Cash in the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line (2005). In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Reese continued to star in more romantic comedies such as Tout... sauf en famille (2008) and How Do You Know (2010). In December 2010, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In the year 2014, she produced both Gone Girl (2014) and Wild (2014) for which she got nominated for best actress Oscar again for her role as Cheryl Strayed Off the screen, she was married to Ryan Phillippe from 1999 to 2007. They met at her 21st birthday party and subsequently worked together in Cruel Intentions (1999). They have two children: a daughter, Ava Elizabeth (born 9 September 1999) and a son, Deacon (born 23 October 2003). In March 2011, Reese remarried talent agent Jim Toth. She gave birth to a second son, Tennessee (born 27 September 2012).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MDcxMDA5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM1NTU5MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000702","name":"Reese Witherspoon","idIMDB":"nm0000702"},"actorId":"nm0000702","character":"Cheryl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0403685","main":true},{"actorName":"Laura Dern","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000368","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NzY0MDQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMzcyNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 February 1967","placeOfBirth":" Saint John's Health Center, Santa Monica, Los Angeles County, California, USA","birthName":"Laura Elizabeth Dern","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Laura Dern was born on February 10, 1967 in Los Angeles, the daughter of actors Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd. Dern was exposed to movie sets and the movie industry from infancy, and obtained several bit parts as a child. Her parents divorced when Dern was two and Dern lost contact with her father for several years as a result. Her parents' background and her own early taste of the moviemaking world soon convinced the young Dern to pursue acting herself. Like so many young actors, her decision may have been influenced by social awkwardness -- the child of 60s counterculture parents, she was steeped in Eastern mysticism and political radicalism, and was seen as an oddball by her more conservative classmates. Her gawky physical appearance didn't help - even before her teens, she had achieved most of her impressive 5' 10\" height, was rail-skinny (other than precociously wide hips), had huge feet and a slouching posture, and for all this was often teased by classmates. Perhaps the nine-year-old Dern found refuge by studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute. The first success for the young Dern came in 1980, with a role in Adrian Lyne's Foxes (1980), a teen movie starring Jodie Foster. She followed this with several small parts, or parts in small movies, such as Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and Teachers (1984), as a student who has an affair with a teacher. (Her mother objected to her active presence on movie sets at age thirteen, which required Dern to sue for emancipation so she could play her role in \"The Fabulous Stains\"). Her next roles, as the blind girl who befriends the deformed boy in Mask (1985), and as a teenaged girl whose sexual awakening collides with a mysterious older man in Smooth Talk (1985), gave her career an important boost. Dern appeared to have made it with a leading role in David Lynch's acclaimed Blue Velvet (1986), but it was four years before her next notable film, and this was the bizarre Wild at Heart (1990), also directed by Lynch. The following year, Dern starred in Rambling Rose (1991), which would become her signature performance, as a sexually-precocious, free-spirited young housemaid in the South in the 1930s. Dern earned an Oscar nomination for her performance, and so did her mother and co-star, Diane Ladd. Dern continues to win prominent roles on the big screen, often in smaller, highly-regarded human dramas such as October Sky (1999), I Am Sam (2001) and We Don't Live Here Anymore (2004), although she is perhaps most widely known for her repeat role as Ellie Sattler in the summer adventure movies Jurassic Park (1993) and Jurassic Park III (2001), or for her guest performance on Ellen (1994), as the woman to whom Ellen finally comes out as a lesbian. Dern's pre-teen gawkiness matured into lithe beauty, but this doesn't prevent Dern from fearlessly throwing herself into a wide variety of roles which are sometimes unflattering, an excellent example being her unflinchingly comic portrayal of an intensely annoying loser whose pregnancy becomes a social and political football in Citizen Ruth (1996). This results in Dern being one of the most interesting actors working in Hollywood today. Having previously dated such Hollywood talent as Treat Williams, Renny Harlin, Kyle MacLachlan, Jeff Goldblum and Billy Bob Thornton, Dern eventually married musician Ben Harper in 2005. Early in her career, Dern was roommate to Marianne Williamson, the spirituality guru. Dern attended two days of college at UCLA and one semester at USC.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NzY0MDQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMzcyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000368","name":"Laura Dern","idIMDB":"nm0000368"},"actorId":"nm0000368","character":"Bobbi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0289697","main":true},{"actorName":"Thomas Sadoski","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0755603","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU2Mjg0NTI3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgwODE1NDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 July 1976","placeOfBirth":" Bethany, Connecticut, USA","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Thomas Sadoski was born on 1st July 1976 in Bethany, Connecticut.

Before Game of Thrones (2011), Huisman had a role in Paul Verhoeven's acclaimed Black Book (2006), and he played Rudolf Nureyev in the BBC TV movie Margot (2009) about prima ballerina Margot Fonteyn. Before he became ubiquitous on television, Huisman also performed in a band called Fontaine that wrote music for soundtracks. (Huisman released a solo album in 2005.) Huisman combined his acting and musical talents on the show Treme (2010), where he played Sonny, a drug addicted musician. Then came Huisman's big break into one of the hottest shows on cable, Game of Thrones (2011), where he took over the role of Daario Naharis. Huisman was given a lot of leeway to approach the character and re-interpret Daario his own way. The creators of Game of Thrones (2011) felt that viewers would adapt to the transition between actors well, and Huisman was indeed accepted by fans of the show. Huisman had the distinction of being on three big shows at the same time, namely \"Thrones,\" country music drama Nashville (2012), where he played producer Liam McGuiniss, and the sci-fi series Orphan Black (2013), where he played Cal Morrison, a human who interacting with clones.

Earl Brown does not usually speak of himself in the third-person. However, the Internet Movie Database will not accept biographical information written in the first person, therefore: W Earl Brown was born and raised in western Kentucky. Realizing early in life that he had aversion to manual labor, he knew that farming life was not for him. The first theater he ever attended was on his grandparents' front porch, where, in following family tradition, they would entertain themselves after a day's work with songs and stories. He was much better suited to that part of Kentucky farm life rather than the fields and barns. In high school, Earl was actively involved, and quite successful, in forensic competition where his coach fired a competitive spirit and taught his students the value of hard work and sacrifice. It was during those years, Earl's love of movies blossomed and he first had the dream of working in films; however, at the point in his life such an idea seemed impossible to achieve. The first in his family to go to college, Earl took an acting class on a whim at Murray State University and it was in that class that he found his Calling. He began performing in numerous productions on campus. It was in a production of \"That Championship Season\" in 1983 that he first had the experience of craft being elevated to art, and due to that, he was hooked. Earl received his MFA from DePaul University's Theatre School in 1989. After graduation, he performed in numerous plays around Chicago. His first job on a film set was teaching dialect on Backdraft (1991). Not long after that, his performance in \"A View From the Bridge\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre catapulted his career as an actor into television and film. He landed numerous roles and within a couple of years had hit the proverbial glass ceiling. In 1993, he relocated to Los Angeles and started over. Wes Craven was an early supporter of Earl's; he cast him in New Nightmare (1994), A Vampire in Brooklyn (1995) and the role of \"Kenny\" in the classic, Scream (1996). Two years after the success of Scream, Earl played \"Warren\", Cameron Diaz's mentally challenged brother, in There's Something About Mary (1998). Among his many other film credits are the highly regarded films: Being John Malkovich (1999), The Master (2012), The Sessions (2012), Wild (2014), and Black Mass (2015) On television, Earl has guest starred in many series, including: Luck (2011), Seinfeld (1995), American Horror Story (2011), Justified (2009), X-Files (2002), Six Feet Under (2001), and NYPD Blue (2000 & 2005). Among the TV movies he has been involved with, was the starring role in VH1's Meatloaf: To Hell and Back (2000). He played \"Tom Carlin\" in ABC's highly acclaimed anthology series American Crime (2015) and \"Teague Dixon\" in HBO's True Detective (2015). He is probably best known as \"Dan Dority\" in HBO's Deadwood (2003). During that series' second season, the show's creator, David Milch, invited him to join the writing staff. In 2007, Earl earned a WGA nomination for writing on a drama series and a SAG nomination for best drama ensemble acting. Establishing himself on a show as critically lauded as Deadwood opened doors for other writing projects, including the Sony release, Bloodworth (2011), which Earl wrote and produced. In addition to his television and film work, Earl co-starred in Sony's The Last Of Us, 2013 Video Game Of The Year. He also writes music and records with Sacred Cowboys, an LA based Americana band. One other thing of note, because W. Earl Brown gets asked it often and it seems as hoity-toity as speaking of himself in the third person: The \"W\" was added to his name upon joining the Screen Actors Guild. The guild has a rule that two actors can not have the same name, he was told that there was an \"Earl Brown\" and a \"William Brown\", hence he became W. Earl Brown (a name he remembered from the label of an Elvis Presley record)... Then when his recording work in Sacred Cowboys necessitated his joining the songwriter's rights association, ASCAP, (where songwriter W. Earl Brown was represented) he had to become \"William Earl Brown.\" It's confusing - he knows.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NTUzMjM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY2Mjk1NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0114868","name":"W.
