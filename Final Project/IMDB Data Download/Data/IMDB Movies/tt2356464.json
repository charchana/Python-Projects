For whatever reason it is the only well that can ride the previously untamed east wind, and thereby learns to love above all else. East wind is for all horse lovers, whether large or small, to highly recommend it. The story captivates until the last second. Great nature shots make the film well worth seeing as many also often dramatic twists. Can one or the other critics despise the story to this friendship as cheesy and boring, I am of the opinion that they were not allowed to experience the magic between humans and animals from their own experience in their lives. East Wind - Together We Are Free.","simplePlot":"A girl who thinks is not good at doing anything has to stay for the holidays with her grandmother at a riding stable. There she discovers her interest in horses, riding and more and what she is good in.","actors":[{"actorName":"Hanna Binke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3437624","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 March 1999","placeOfBirth":" Germany","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Hanna Binke was born on March 17, 1999 in Germany.
