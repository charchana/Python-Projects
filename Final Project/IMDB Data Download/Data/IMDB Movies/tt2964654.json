Whether she is performing on the big stage, for TV/ Film cameras or for her two puppies at home, she is completely content when she is expressing herself as the actress, singer and dancer that she was born to be. Brittany's passion for performing began as a youngster through studying competitive dance. Dance provided a wonderfully creative outlet for her and helped Brittany realize how expressing yourself through the performing arts was a gift and a blessing. Dancing since the time she was three years old eventually lead her to find that she shared the same passion for acting, singing and modeling as well. Thanks to her immensely supportive parents, Brittany started to venture into the professional world of performing arts in her teenage years. At only 15 years of age, she landed her first major film credit. She was to be a cast member of the Oscar-Award winning movie 'Chicago'. From then on, Brittany has been blessed with an unstoppable career as a working performer. Brittany is forever grateful to all of the people who have nurtured her career and helped her along the way. If it were not for all of you, she would not be the person she is today. Her motto: Dream big and let your light shine!","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1695972","name":"Brittany Gray","nicknames":["Miss B"],"idIMDB":"nm1695972"},"actorId":"nm1695972","character":"Kimber","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jessica Phillips","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3162027","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTQzNjA5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzExNDMwNTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Jessica Rimmer","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Jessica Phillips was born as Jessica Rimmer.
