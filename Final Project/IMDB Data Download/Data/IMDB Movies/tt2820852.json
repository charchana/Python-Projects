He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager, in an artist's housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\". His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel. Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called Multi-Facial (1995), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. Multi-Facial (1995) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception. Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, Strays (1997). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. Steven Spielberg was impressed by Multi-Facial (1995) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in Saving Private Ryan (1998). Multi-Facial (1995) earned Vin more work, when the director of The Iron Giant (1999) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career has steadily grown, with him securing his first lead role as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film Pitch Black (2000). The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves. Since then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002), Baby-sittor (2005), Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), and Furious 7 (2015). He also voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and starred in the lower-budgeted courtroom drama Jugez-moi coupable (2006), the latter directed by Sidney Lumet.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNzA4MDYxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI1MDAxOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874","name":"Vin Diesel","idIMDB":"nm0004874"},"actorId":"nm0004874","character":"Dominic Toretto","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004171","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Walker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908094","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwODc0OTk2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ5MDA0Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 September 1973","placeOfBirth":" Glendale, California, USA","birthName":"Paul William Walker IV","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Paul William Walker IV was born in Glendale, California. He grew up together with his brothers, Caleb and Cody, and sisters, Ashlie and Amie. Their parents, Paul William Walker III, a sewer contractor, and Cheryl (Crabtree) Walker, a model, separated around September 2004. His grandfather, William Walker, was a Pearl Harbor survivor and a Navy middleweight boxing champion, while his maternal grandfather commanded a tank battalion in Italy under General Patton during World War II. Paul grew up active in sports like soccer and surfing. He had English and German ancestry. Paul was cast for the first season of the family sitcom, Throb (1986) and began modeling until he received a script for the 1994 movie, Tammy and the T-Rex (1994). He attended high school at Village Christian High School in Sun Valley, California, graduating in 1991. With encouragement from friends and an old casting agent who remembered him as a child, he decided to try his luck again with acting shortly after returning from College. He starred in Meet the Deedles (1998), a campy, silly but surprisingly fun film which failed to garner much attention. However, lack of attention would not be a problem for Paul Walker for long. With Pleasantville (1998), he appeared in his first hit. As the town stud (a la 1950s) who more than meets his match in modern day Reese Witherspoon, he was one of the most memorable characters of the film. That same year, Paul and his then-girlfriend Rebecca had a baby girl named Meadow Walker (Meadow Rain Walker). Even though Paul publicly admitted that Meadow was not planned, he said that she is his number one priority. Paul and Rebecca separated and Meadow lives with her mother in Hawaii. She often visited with Paul as his homes in Santa Barbara and Huntington Beach, California. Roles in the teen hits Varsity Blues (1999), She's All That (1999) and The Skulls (2000) cemented Walker's continued rise to celebrity. He was chosen to be one of the young stars featured on the cover of Vanity Fair's annual Hollywood issue in April 2000. While the other stars on the cover, brooded and tried their best to look sexy and serious, Paul smiled brightly and showed why he is not part of the norm. This is one young actor who certainly stood apart from the rest of the crowd, not only with his talent but with his attitude. The Dallas Morning News commented in March of 2000 that, \"Paul is one of the rarest birds in Hollywood- a pretension free movie star.\" The latest blockbuster hit, The Fast and the Furious (2001), had raised his stardom to an even higher level. His fighting scenes in movies lead to a passion for martial arts. He has studied various forms of Jujitsu, Taekwondo, Jeet Kune Do and Eskrima. Paul mentioned in a magazine interview that he had hoped enroll in the Keysi Fighting Method when it comes to the United States. Other than practicing martial arts, Paul enjoyed relaxing at home with his daughter, Meadow Rain, surfing near his Huntington Beach abode, walking his dogs and just driving. When Paul seriously did get a break from the entertainment business, he said he loved traveling. Paul had traveled to India, Fiji, Costa Rica, Sarawak, Brunei, Borneo and other parts of the Asian continent. Tragically, Paul Walker died in a car crash on Saturday November 30, 2013, after attending a charity event for \"Reach Out Worldwide\". Several of Paul's films were released after his death, include Hours (2013), Brick Mansions (2014), and his final starring role in The Fast and the Furious series, Furious 7 (2015), part of which was completed after his death. The film's closing scenes paid tribute to Walker, whose character met with a happy ending, and rode off into the sunset.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwODc0OTk2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ5MDA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908094","name":"Paul Walker","idIMDB":"nm0908094"},"actorId":"nm0908094","character":"Brian O'Conner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004175","main":true},{"actorName":"Jason Statham","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005458","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzk2MDkwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAxODQwMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 July 1967","placeOfBirth":" Shirebrook, Derbyshire, England, UK","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Jason Statham was born in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Eileen (Yates), a dancer, and Barry Statham, a street merchant and lounge singer.

He got the audition for his debut role as Bacon in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) through French Connection, for whom he was modeling. They became a major investor in the film and introduced Jason to Guy Ritchie, who invited him to audition for a part in the film by challenging him to impersonate an illegal street vendor and convince him to purchase fake jewelery. Jason must have been doing something right because after the success of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) he teamed up again with Guy Ritchie for Snatch (2000), with co-stars including Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina and Benicio Del Toro.

She was born Mayte Michelle Rodriguez on July 12, 1978, in Bexar County, Texas, to Carmen Milady Pared Espinal, from the Dominican Republic, and Rafael Rodríguez Santiago, who served in the U.S. Army and was originally from Puerto Rico. Michelle always knew she was destined to become a star, she just didn't know how to get there. Michelle lived in Texas until the age of 8 when her family moved to the Dominican Republic where she lived for two years before moving to Puerto Rico. At 11, Michelle's family relocated for the last time to Jersey City, New Jersey. Although she has been working since 1999 as an extra in such films as Summer of Sam (1999) and Cradle Will Rock (1999), it only took a magazine ad announcing an open casting call in New York for Michelle to decide to finally step into the spotlight. The role was the female lead, the movie was Girlfight (2000). Despite the lack of experience in film and boxing, Michelle auditioned, along with another 350 girls. After various trials inside an actual boxing ring and five arduous months of training in Brooklyn's Gleason's Gym, she was finally chosen to portray the role of Diana Guzman. As soon as the independent film began making the rounds at various film festivals, Michelle began gaining critical acclaim for her performance earning her awards like the Deauville Festival of American Cinema award for Best Actress and the Las Vegas Film Critics Society for Female Breakthrough Performance. As Girlfight (2000) continued to gain notoriety with its September 2000 release, Michelle was already hard at work with films like 3 A.M. (2001), the blockbuster hit The Fast and the Furious (2001), and Resident Evil (2002). With Hollywood calling her name, the future for this feisty Jersey girl is as strong as the punches she throws.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEzODQ1OTA0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2MDc1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0735442","name":"Michelle Rodriguez","nicknames":["MRod"],"idIMDB":"nm0735442"},"actorId":"nm0735442","character":"Letty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004176","main":true},{"actorName":"Jordana Brewster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0108287","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1OTMwMzM3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM5MzIyODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 April 1980","placeOfBirth":" Panama City, Panama","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Raven-haired beauty Jordana Brewster was born on April 26, 1980 in Panama City, Panama.

He is of English, German, Scottish, and Irish descent. His first roles were as a child in television series, including a lead role in the Western series The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (1963). Russell landed a part in the Elvis Presley movie, It Happened at the World's Fair (1963), when he was ten years old. Walt Disney himself signed Russell to a 10-year contract, and, according to Robert Osborne, he became the studio's top star of the 1970s. Having voiced adult Copper in the animated Disney film The Fox and the Hound (1981), Russell is one of the few famous child stars in Hollywood who has been able to continue his acting career past his teen years. Kurt spent the early 1970s playing minor league baseball. In 1979, he gave a classic performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's ABC TV movie Elvis (1979), and married the actress who played Priscilla Presley in the film, Season Hubley. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for the role. He followed with roles in a string of well-received films, including Used Cars (1980) and Silkwood (1983), for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. During the 1980s, he starred in several films by director Carpenter; they created some of his best-known roles, including anti-hero army-turned-robber Snake Plissken in the futuristic action film Escape from New York (1981) (and later in its 1996 sequel Escape from L.A. (1996)), Antarctic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady in the horror film The Thing (1982), and Jack Burton in the fantasy film Big Trouble in Little China (1986), all of which have since become cult classics. The Thing was based on the short story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr., which had been interpreted on film before, albeit loosely, in 1951's The Thing from Another World (1951). In Big Trouble in Little China, Russell played a truck driver caught in an ancient Chinese war.

She was born in Rosh Ha'ayin, Israel, to a Jewish family (from Poland, Austria, Germany, and Czechoslovakia). She served in the IDF for two years, and won the Miss Israel title in 2004. Gal began modeling in the late 2000s, and made her film debut in the fourth film of the Fast and Furious franchise, Fast & Furious (2009), as Gisele. Her role was expanded in the sequels Fast Five (2011) and Fast & Furious 6 (2013), in which her character was romantically linked to Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang). In the films, Gal performed her own stunts. She also appeared in the 2010 films Date Night (2010) and Knight and Day (2010). In early December 2013, Gal was cast as Wonder Woman in the superhero team-up film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and filming began in 2014 for a March 2016 release. The film is part of the DC Extended Universe, and Gadot will play the role again in the solo film Wonder Woman (2017) and superhero team-up Justice League (2017). Gadot received swordsmanship, Kung Fu kickboxing, Capoeira and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training in preparation for the role. As a result, her performance as the superhero, which is the first time for the character on film, was hailed as one of the best parts of the otherwise poorly-received film. Gal is a motorcycle enthusiast, and owns a black 2006 Ducati Monster-S2R. She has been married to Yaron Versano since September 28, 2008. They have two children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1NDMwNTQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYxNDc1ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2933757","name":"Gal Gadot","idIMDB":"nm2933757"},"actorId":"nm2933757","character":"Gisele","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0489044","main":true},{"actorName":"John Brotherton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1383586","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NzY2NzY4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAzMTA4NzE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"John Brotherton is an actor and producer, known for Fuller House (2016), Furious 7 (2015) and The Conjuring (2013).
