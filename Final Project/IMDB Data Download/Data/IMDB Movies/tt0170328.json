Michael Powell gave him leading parts in four of his first films before using him again in his classic The Red Shoes (1948) as George, the stage door keeper. But as of the mid-thirties Verno only got minor parts, although very conspicuous ones: a Cockney never goes unnoticed. Impossible to miss him as the commercial traveler in his two Hitchcock films The 39 Steps (1935) and as the lorry driver in The Girl Was Young (1937). All in all, Verno's film career may seem modest but it must not be overlooked that he worked from childhood (he started as a boy vocalist) to old age in variety, pantomime, theater, musicals and television. You can't be everywhere at the same time!","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894624","name":"Jerry Verno","idIMDB":"nm0894624"},"actorId":"nm0894624","character":"Shopwalker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Wood","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0939796","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 November 1909","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"John Wood was born on November 11, 1909 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
