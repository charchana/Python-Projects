When the local solicitor's wife, Angela Symington, is found dead with a poison pen letter at her side, the coroner rules that she took her own life. Not surprisingly, Jane Marple disagrees and is convinced it was murder. When a second villager is killed, it appears Miss Marple is correct. She also deduces the real purpose of the letters.","simplePlot":"The normally friendly village of Lymston is plagued by vile anonymous letters.

Her stage career began with provincial theater in 1927, going on to a long series of West End comedies, usually playing the part of a confused or eccentric middle-age woman. She performed at the Regent's Park Open Air Theater, at the time London was subject to World War II bombing. Her work gradually included screen roles: The Outsider (1948), The Promoter (1952), The 39 Steps (1959) - over 80 movies in all - but her stage career continued, with parts in three Peter Nichols plays, Noël Coward's \"Blithe Spirit\" (1976) and and a Tony award supporting actress performance in Alan Ayckbourn's \"Bedroom Farce\" (1977). Her first Agatha Christie role was \"Miss Pryce\" in the play, \"Appointment With Death\" (1946), which prompted Christie, herself, to write \"I hope you will play my dear Miss Marple\". She began playing this, her best known part, in her late 70s, in a BBC television series which ran from 1984 to 1992. A Miss Marple fan, Queen Elizabeth II, awarded her the Order of the British Empire in 1987. After the series closed, Joan recorded audio books of the Christie mysteries. She died, aged 92, in a hospital at Colchester, Essex, survived by a son and daughter (her physician husband Eric Butler died in 1967).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382995","name":"Joan Hickson","nicknames":["Joanie","Miss M"],"idIMDB":"nm0382995"},"actorId":"nm0382995","character":" Miss Marple","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0026660","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Culver","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191741","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTAwMDQwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNTM0MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 June 1938","placeOfBirth":" Hampstead, London, England, UK","bio":"Michael Culver was born on June 16, 1938 in Hampstead, London, England.

The 1973 film starred Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland as John and Laura Baxter, a grieving couple holidaying in a wintry Venice after the death of their daughter, Christine, who was drowned in the garden pond while wearing a shiny, red mackintosh. When Laura meets the two spinster sisters in a restaurant toilet, she is shocked to be told that Heather has seen her daughter. \"I've seen her and she wants you to know that she's happy,\" says the old woman: I've seen your little girl, sitting between you and your husband, and she was laughing. Yes, oh, yes, she's with you, my dear, and she's laughing. She's wearing a shiny little mac. She's laughing, she's laughing - she's happy as can be. Later, Laura attends a seance with the sisters and - when Heather gets what she claims to be a message from Christine - is disturbed to be told that her husband, John (Sutherland), is in danger. A sceptical John fails to heed the warning and in the final scenes of the film is murdered by a female dwarf in a red, hooded coat. Throughout this eerie film, based on a Daphne du Maurier short story, the director, Nicolas Roeg, leaves us unsure whether Mason's chilling character really is a psychic or a con artist, particularly in a scene showing the sisters laughing after convincing Laura that they have contacted her daughter. Born in Birmingham in 1917, Mason won a scholarship to the London School of Dramatic Art before gaining repertory theatre experience in Preston, Southport, York and Guildford. During the Second World War she performed with the troops entertainment organisation Ensa. Mason made her television debut as Mrs Drummond in the drama series Thunder in the West (1957), and played Mrs Yapp in the Midlands-based local council serial Swizzlewick (1964) and Mrs Timothy in the soccer soap United! (1965-67), as well as taking two roles in Coronation Street. Following a bit-part as Mrs Ainsworth (1965), she was Derek Wilton's mother (1976), who disapproved of her son's relationship with the dithering Mavis Riley and insisted it must end - to no avail. Adept at character roles, Mason took eight different parts in Z Cars (1962-71) and another three in Dixon of Dock Green (1965, 1966, 1967), before playing Lady Boleyn in the acclaimed, six-part drama The Six Wives of Henry VIII (starring Keith Michell in the title role, 1970), Mrs Nickleby in Nicholas Nickleby (1977), Mrs Gummidge in David Copperfield (1986) and Mrs Fagge in Great Expectations (1989). In comedy, she acted Mrs Booth, exasperated mother to the chalk-and-cheese twin brothers, in My Brother's Keeper (1975-76) and Gladys (1990-94) in Maid Marian and Her Merry Men, the children's series written by Tony Robinson - with Mason's real-life husband, the actor Roger Ostime, taking the role of Gladys's father in one episode. She also played Michael Palin's mother in the Ripping Yarns episode \"The Curse of the Claw\" (1977). After her part in \"Don't Look Now\", Mason was cast in the horror films I Don't Want To Be Born (acting Mrs Hyde, alongside Joan Collins as a stripper who gives birth to a \"possessed\" baby, 1975), Dolls (1987), Afraid of the Dark (1991) and Haunted (1995). Mason also appeared twice in One Foot In The Grave during the 1990s. She died in 2006 in Milton Keynes, England and left a husband of 50 years Roger Ostime, they had married in 1955 in Surrey.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0556739","name":"Hilary Mason","idIMDB":"nm0556739"},"actorId":"nm0556739","character":" Emily Barton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0152024","main":true},{"actorName":"Dilys Hamlett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358251","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 March 1928","placeOfBirth":" Tidworth, Hampshire, England, UK","bio":"Dilys Hamlett was born on March 31, 1928 in Tidworth, Hampshire, England.

Forced to leave Russia during the turmoil, his family returned to England where John was schooled at Epworth College and later trained for acting at RADA. On stage from 1936, he made his debut at the London West End in 1938 (in the revue \"Happy Returns\"). He resumed his theatrical career following wartime army service, even enjoying a brief stint as a stand-up comic at the Windmill Theatre. During the 1950's, he appeared in plays by Shakespeare and Chekhov at the Arts Theatre Club and at the Old Vic (both in London and in Bristol), as well as doubling up reporting sports on commercial television under the nom de plume 'Howard Peters'. A tall man with urbane manners, a no-nonsense attitude, often sporting a pencil moustache, Arnatt is best remembered for his many impersonations on screen of thoughtful, pipe-smoking authority figures: Scotland Yard inspectors, commissioners, diplomats, aristocrats and army officers. In Doctor Who (1963) (\"The Invasion of Time\"), he played the Time Lord Borusa, one-time Lord Chancellor of Gallifrey. He was, perhaps, most effectively employed as deputy sheriff (temporarily replacing Alan Wheatley) or as the high sheriff of Nottingham in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1955), a worthy antagonist to Richard Greene.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0036031","name":"John Arnatt","idIMDB":"nm0036031"},"actorId":"nm0036031","character":" Rev.

Nonetheless, he will be best remembered by the majority of viewers as the wily rector of To the Manor Born (1979). The son of a Barings Bank employee, Gerald was born in Liverpool on June 4, 1925. His elder sister was the actress Sheila Sim. After schooling in Kent he was trained at RADA, apparently having become enamored with acting after listening to a 1943 radio broadcast of John Gielgud (entitled \"The Great Ship\"). Then followed extensive repertory experience, both in England, and in Durban, South Africa (1954, with the McNeale Company). Beginning with a small role in Fame Is the Spur (1947), Sim was to eventually become one of Britain's most reliable, yet ever-so-discreet screen character players, his profile firmly established in several films directed by Bryan Forbes, including Whistle Down the Wind (1961), King Rat (1965) and The Wrong Box (1966). He was most often featured as bumptious upper crusts (suitably convincing because of his clear voice and precise diction), obtuse vicars, police inspectors, barristers and very British stiff-upper-lip military types. He appeared in seven films directed by his brother-in-law Richard Attenborough: Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), Young Winston (1972), A Bridge Too Far (1977), Gandhi (1982), Cry Freedom (1987), Chaplin (1992) and Shadowlands (1993). After repeated guest roles in such prime time shows as Dixon of Dock Green (1955) and The Avengers (1961), Sim became firmly entrenched in the medium and never looked back.
