Although Adrian started acting at age 14, he didn't take it seriously until his senior year when he landed his first full length theatrical production of the high school musical Fame. He grew up playing many sports such as baseball, football, and basketball but dancing was his life. Adrian was mostly known for his dancing ability and participated in countless hip-hop and break dancing competitions where he was extremely successful. His high school was looking for the lead dancer in the musical Fame, so Adrian auditioned and the rest is history. Ultimately, dancing is what launched Adrian into acting, where he received a scholarship to the theatre program at the University of Central Florida, Orlando. Adrian had the fortunate opportunity to work with some of the top-acting professionals in the country. During his training at the University of Central Florida, he worked on Nickelodeon's Gamelab, Slimetime Live and the prestigious Orlando Shakespeare Festival. In 1999, Adrian decided with the training, knowledge and experience he obtained through hard work, it was time to move to Hollywood and live out his dream in television and film. After arriving in Hollywood, Adrian struggled and found himself determined to propel forward... and that he did by landing a co-starring role on the TV show Profiler. From here, Adrian met casting director Anthony Barneo who became the reason Adrian is where he is today. Adrian joined Anthony Barneo's acting company Blue Sphere Alliance and had the opportunity to play multiple characters in the play \"A Piece of My Heart.\" Having no representation, it was this opportunity that landed Adrian an agent, manager, recurring guest star (Battery Park), and a lead in a feature film (Artie). Through the success of his Ovation nominated performance in \"A Piece of My Heart\", Adrian has not stopped working and continues to enjoy countless television and film roles. Some of Adrian's favorite guest starring and recurring roles include: CSI: Crime Scene Investagation, 24, CSI: NY, JAG, Alias, Frasier and Summerland. Some of his favorite film roles include S1m0ne (with Al Pacino), Graduation Night (with Abigail Spencer and Kevin Alejandro), All Or Nothing (jury award-winning film at the Hollywood Film Festival), Straight Jacket, and Artie (with Kevin Farley). Adrian can be seen almost everyday on the Disney Channel and ABC Saturday mornings playing the role of Esteban Julio Ricardo Montoya Dela Rosa Ramirez from the mega hit television show \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.\" This is Adrian's most visible character to date and by far Adrian's favorite role yet. Aside from acting, Adrian guest directs a syndicated kid's television show called \"Kids Unlimited.\" Not only does Adrian act and direct, he has been a successful host on multiple TV shows. Some of his hosting credits include: The Big Talent Be (syndicated) Beach Diaries (Travel Channel), Slimetime Live (Nickelodeon) Viva TV (ABC), Kids Zone (GSN) and currently can be seen hosting \"On the Up\" for the SiTV network.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMzMwMTI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY0ODI1NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0704590","name":"Adrian R'Mante","idIMDB":"nm0704590"},"actorId":"nm0704590","character":"Storm Johnson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeff D'Agostino","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0194885","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NTgwMzAyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4NzM2OQ@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 September 1982","placeOfBirth":" Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","birthName":"Jeffrey Frank D'Agostino","bio":"Actor & Recording Artist, Jeff D'Agostino is the lead singer/songwriter of Rock/Electro band Perfect Dilemma, signed to Interscope Records. Born and raised in Fort Collins, Colorado, Jeff began acting & singing in local theatre programs when he was 8 years old. At age 13, he was discovered by a Los Angeles based talent agent, while attending an acting class in Denver, Colorado. In 1996, Jeff took a brief trip to Los Angeles with his father, and landed the lead role in the Nickelodeon TV pilot, \"Skwids\" (1996). Unable to make the move to Los Angeles with his family at the time, Jeff returned to Colorado where he completed Jr. High & High School. D'Agostino then made his permanent move to Los Angeles in 2001. Upon his return, he quickly started booking guest starring roles on hit TV shows including: \"CSI: Miami\" (2002) \"Without a Trace\" (2002), \"Malcolm in the Middle\" (2002), Judging Amy (2003), \"Good Morning, Miami\" (2003) etc., and starred along side the Olsen Twins in the feature film \"Getting There\" (2002). Jeff then landed a series regular role on David E.

He joined as the front-man for the band \"The Perfect Victim,\" and released the album \"One Against the Odds\" with Dirty Icon Productions in 2007. After touring the west coast, the band broke up in 2008. Around the same time, Jeff's personal friend, Tayren Southern cast him in her web series \"Private High Musical\" (2009), which pulled his focus back into acting. Shortly after, director Tamar Simon Hoffs saw Jeff's performance in the web series, and offered him a role in her independent feature film \"Pound of Flesh\" (2009) with Malcolm McDowell. A few months later, Jeff landed a lead role in the Independent Sci-Fi Horror Film \"Underground\" (2009) followed by Ghost House Pictures Comedy Horror Series \"Zombie Roadkill\" (2010). In the summer of 2010 Jeff started his own band \"Perfect Dilemma.\" After writing and recording a few demos he was offered a record deal, and signed with Rock Mafia Records (RMR Music Group) in Feb. 2010. With recognition from Music Producer Timbaland & Interscope Records Chairman Jimmy Iovine, Jeff was then signed to Interscope Records in 2011.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NTgwMzAyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4NzM2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0194885","name":"Jeff D'Agostino","idIMDB":"nm0194885"},"actorId":"nm0194885","character":"Eric Abercrombie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Christine Evangelista","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2237471","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTU1NDM3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1MTkzMjE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Christine Evangelista is an actress, known for The Intern (2015), The Walking Dead (2010) and The Arrangement (2017).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTU1NDM3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1MTkzMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2237471","name":"Christine Evangelista","idIMDB":"nm2237471"},"actorId":"nm2237471","character":"Jenna Hughes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Megan Hensley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3655078","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ4MjkxOTIwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk4NzkyODE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Megan Hensley was born in Des Moines, Iowa, USA.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, he did his first professional theater and TV work there before heading for New York during the glory days of TV, appearing in many prestigious early shows like Studio One in Hollywood (1948), and soap operas such as As the World Turns (1956) and Guiding Light (1952). He also did seven seasons of New York regional and stock theater.
