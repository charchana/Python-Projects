","actors":[{"actorName":"Rock Madison","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535011","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"A hoax name! Made up by Jerry Warren as a cross between Rock Hudson and Guy Madison, Warren originally intended to use it as a pseudonym for male lead Tom Maruzzi in Man Beast (1956). However, to make the cast seem larger, Warren turned around and included Maruzzi also at 3rd billing, though assigned to the character he really played; made up a nonexistent film character, \"Lon Raynon\" to justify keeping Rock Madison in the credits, and later told interviewers that, while \"Lon Raynon\" was cut from the film, \"Madison\" played the yeti. In fact, the yeti was only played by others in the cast in rotation, and Warren's future wife, Brianne Murphy. Later, Warren resurrected the Madison name for the star billing in Creature of the Walking Dead (1965), though none of the advertising associates any named actors (including Madison) with any of the characters. As that film was essentially an edited Mexican feature, Warren could have conceivably argued that Rock Madison here was just a pseudonym for one of the Mexican actors, but there is no evidence he actually did so. Therefore, Rock Madison becomes a name without a body, a true non-person.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535011","name":"Rock Madison","idIMDB":"nm0535011"},"actorId":"nm0535011","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Asa Maynor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0562834","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 September 1936","placeOfBirth":" Birmingham, Alabama, USA","birthName":"Virginia Maynor","bio":"Asa Maynor was born on September 22, 1936 in Birmingham, Alabama, USA as Virginia Maynor.

He worked at a few stations in the mid-south and in the Twin Cities market before he was drafted; he later (1953) came out to Hollywood using the G.I. Bill to attend the Pasadena Playhouse. He made his movie debut in a small, uncredited role in \"The Court Jester\" (1956); producer-director Jerry Warren later saw him in a little theater production and gave him one of the starring roles in \"Man Beast\" (1956), Nelson's first of several Warren movies. (Because \"Man Beast\" was non-union, Nelson used the nom de screen \"Lloyd Cameron.\") The Pasadena Playhouse helped him get him a job as dialogue coach on the TV series \"Lassie\"; he coached child star Jon Provost, who (according to Nelson) couldn't read. During his long run on \"Lassie,\" Nelson learned the duties of a script supervisor and switched over to that profession. After he retired from script supervising, he went through the police academy and became a reserve cop. (\"Strictly administrative, believe me. I could no more do a foot chase than climb Mount Everest!\")","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0625555","name":"Lloyd Nelson","idIMDB":"nm0625555"},"actorId":"nm0625555","character":"Trevor Hudson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"George Wells Lewis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507222","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"George Wells Lewis is an actor, known for Man Beast (1956).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507222","name":"George Wells Lewis","idIMDB":"nm0507222"},"actorId":"nm0507222","character":"Dr. Eric Erickson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jack Haffner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0353126","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jack Haffner is an actor and set decorator, known for Man Beast (1956), The Incredible Petrified World (1959) and Teenage Zombies (1959).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0353126","name":"Jack Haffner","idIMDB":"nm0353126"},"actorId":"nm0353126","character":"Kheon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wong Sing","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0801865","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Wong Sing is an actor, known for Man Beast (1956).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0801865","name":"Wong Sing","idIMDB":"nm0801865"},"actorId":"nm0801865","character":"Trader","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0049468","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049468","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":"Jerry Warren Productions, Inc.
