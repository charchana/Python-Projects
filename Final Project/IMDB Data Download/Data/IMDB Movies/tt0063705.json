This led to several small parts in movies before earning the lead role in the infamous 3D thriller Robot Monster (1953). The movie was bad but profitable, and Nader soon had a contract with Universal Pictures. Unfortunately, the studio already had on its roster such good-looking and athletic actors as Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis and Jeff Chandler, so Nader often found himself being cast in their leftovers, usually playing parts that emphasized his \"beefcake\" appeal. (At 6' 1\" and 180 pounds, Nader had the kind of physique fan magazines drooled over and unlike many of his colleagues, he frequently appeared with his chest hair intact.) However, he did enjoy a few good years in the mid-1950s, turning in a commendable performance in Away All Boats (1956) before his career began to decline. He tried his hand at three TV series and then relocated to Europe, where he enjoyed a modest revival in the late 1960s starring as \"Jerry Cotton\" in a series of West German films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4MTA0OTE1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYyNTEwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618865","name":"George Nader","idIMDB":"nm0618865"},"actorId":"nm0618865","character":"Jerry Cotton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0093033","main":true},{"actorName":"Heinz Weiss","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919010","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 June 1921","placeOfBirth":" Stuttgart, Germany","bio":"Heinz Weiss was born on June 12, 1921 in Stuttgart, Germany.
