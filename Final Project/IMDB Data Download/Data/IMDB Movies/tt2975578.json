He grew up in pre-Andean Salta in northern Argentina. In 1961, while attending high school at the Colegio Nacional, he became dazzled with film while watching Taras Bulba (1962) with Yul Brynner and Tony Curtis being shot on the rolling hills of Salta. He proceeded to become a pre-med student at the Universidad Nacional de Tucumán, Argentina, but soon quit medical school to study Drama and English. With the Teatro Universitario de Tucumán he was cast in the role of The Player in the memorable production of 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead', which traveled to the renowned Teatro Cervantes in Buenos Aires in 1971. The same year he was awarded a Fulbright fellowship for graduate studies in International Theater at the University of Kansas. He again performed The Player in 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead', this time in English, with Mandy Patinkin starring as Rosencrantz. He moved to New York City in 1972, where he devoted himself to experimental theater. Funded by a Ford foundation grant he created and directed the Free Theater Lab, which performed works by Fernando Arrabal, T.S. Eliot and others at non-conventional venues such as Theater at Saint Clement's, the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine and Union Theological Seminary. In 1975, Guerra returned to Argentina with his solo piece, 'Holiday for a Unicorn', which he presented under political scrutiny during the military dictatorship. Upon his return to New York, he performed at the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park in 1979, next to Raul Julia' and Richard Dreyfuss in _Othello (1979)(V)_, and with Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington in Coriolanus (1979). He was the drummer in the band Tragic Flaw along with Steve Anderson on lead guitar and vocals and Christy Risska on bass; they often played at their neighborhood bar, the historic CBGB's on the Bowery. His Equity membership came along with the play 'Watch On The Rhine' at Baltimore's Center Stage. He also performed in 'Much Ado About Nothing' in Baltimore, and in 'Galileo,' 'The Suicide,' 'Undiscovered Country,' and 'Animal Crackers' at Washington, D.C.'s Arena Stage. His first film Two of a Kind (1983) brought him to Los Angeles. In 1986, he performed in the ensemble production of 'Green Card' at the Mark Taper Forum, and in 1987, he was Prospero in 'The Tempest' at La Jolla Playhouse. Along with film and TV work he has kept in touch with the theater through his portrayal of The Bishop in LATC's annual multimedia production of 'La Virgen de Guadalupe' at the Cathedral of Nuestra Señora de Los Angeles. His polished voice has given him a parallel career in commercials, promos, trailers, animation and documentaries. His unique versatility has opened him to a many-faceted path as an actor. His children Clarity and Ian crown his many blessings.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5NTUxNzc2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQzODEzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0346003","name":"Castulo Guerra","nicknames":["Pericles"],"idIMDB":"nm0346003"},"actorId":"nm0346003","character":"Barney","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0486943","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Kenneth Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931324","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNTg2NjA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ4NzY5Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1966","placeOfBirth":" Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Michael Kenneth Williams","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born in Brooklyn, to an African American father from South Carolina and a Bahamian mother from Nassau, Michael K. Williams was raised in the Vandaveer housing projects in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York City and attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School. According to a DNA analysis, he is descended partly from the Mende people of Sierra Leone. After getting in some trouble as a youth, he enrolled at the National Black Theatre in New York City. He later got a job at a pharmaceutical company. Inspired by Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814, he left school and quit his job, against the wishes of his family, to pursue a career as a dancer. During a year in which he was intermittently homeless, Williams visited record labels and dance studios looking for work. He got a job as a background dancer on a music tour for Akym Sims' dance anthem Too Blind To See It, which led to more work appearing as a dancer in videos and on tours, such as with George Michael, Madonna, as well as some modelling work. He also choreographed Crystal Waters' 1994 single \"100% Pure Love\". He is an established actor and producer, perhaps best-known for his role on the highly-acclaimed HBO Television series The Wire (2002) where he played Omar Little. Other notable works he performed in have included The Road (2009) Boardwalk Empire (2010), 12 Years a Slave (2013) and RoboCop (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNTg2NjA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ4NzY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931324","name":"Michael Kenneth Williams","idIMDB":"nm0931324"},"actorId":"nm0931324","character":"Carmelo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0486944","main":true},{"actorName":"Edwin Hodge","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0388064","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NjYzNzM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI1ODc3Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 January 1985","placeOfBirth":" Onslow County, North Carolina, USA","birthName":"Edwin Martel Basil Hodge","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Edwin Hodge was born on January 26, 1985 in Onslow County, North Carolina, USA as Edwin Martel Basil Hodge.
