Laughter is always in the air when Barry is in the room. It surfaced in his youth where he was raised in southern Alberta, Canada. People always looked forward to seeing Barry, his early years in 4H clubs he entertained with his endless repertoire of jokes. Later into his rodeo years with his Dad the natural entertainer shown through. So of course he was drawn like a moth to a flame when it came to theatre arts in high school. College and on into his professional life, the acting bug kept urging him to study the craft and pursue his interest in film and television. While in Calgary attending acting classes he met his wife, and trained with Judy Kerr in Los Angeles. Barry went on to have a successful career in commercials in Canada, while adding in small movie roles. His priority changed for a few years, to providing for his growing family, but his fingers were always in some sort of local theatre production. Acting finally lead him to Los Angeles where he now dedicates more time pursing his acting passion. His latest role was the lead for National Geographic's \"Locked Up Abroad\" series titled \"Vegas Mobster\" where he portrayed real life mobster \"Frank Cullotta\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5OTM1NzY5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk4OTUyMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0648796","name":"Barry Onody","idIMDB":"nm0648796"},"actorId":"nm0648796","character":"Bartender","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Michaud","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0584723","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"John Michaud is an actor, known for The Virgin Queen of St. Francis High (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0584723","name":"John Michaud","idIMDB":"nm0584723"},"actorId":"nm0584723","character":"Allan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ian Schmaltz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0772566","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ian Schmaltz is an actor, known for The Virgin Queen of St. Francis High (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0772566","name":"Ian Schmaltz","idIMDB":"nm0772566"},"actorId":"nm0772566","character":"Jerry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ron Grondin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0343084","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ron Grondin is an actor, known for The Virgin Queen of St. Francis High (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0343084","name":"Ron Grondin","idIMDB":"nm0343084"},"actorId":"nm0343084","character":"Reggie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mike Francis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290259","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Mike Francis is an actor, known for The Virgin Queen of St. Francis High (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290259","name":"Mike Francis","idIMDB":"nm0290259"},"actorId":"nm0290259","character":"Extra","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rosanne Mandalone","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541608","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Rosanne Mandalone is an actress, known for The Virgin Queen of St. Francis High (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541608","name":"Rosanne Mandalone","idIMDB":"nm0541608"},"actorId":"nm0541608","character":"Extra","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lorenza Mandalone","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541607","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Lorenza Mandalone is an actor, known for The Virgin Queen of St. Francis High (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541607","name":"Lorenza Mandalone","idIMDB":"nm0541607"},"actorId":"nm0541607","character":"Extra","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0096394","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096394","business":{"budget":{"money":"$750,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"08","month":"07","year":"1985","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"07","month":"09","year":"1985","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 29 min (89 min) (USA)"],"soundMix":["Stereo","Mono"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":["Arriflex Cameras and Lenses"],"laboratory":["Alpha-Cine Labs","The Local Lab"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"3.7","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Calgary, Alberta, Canada"}],"rated":"PG","awards":[],"votes":"103","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0030656","name":"American Artists"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["bet","misleading title","virginity","teenage girl in swimwear","james bond spoof scene","christian theme","christian subtext","chastity","independent film"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 11:23:49"}}
