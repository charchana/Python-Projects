And yet, Guiomar first saw himself as a dentist, ... like Daddy! But he finally proved the saying 'Like father like song' wrong. Too bad for dentistry but so much the better for entertainment which otherwise would have had to do without his singular talent. And, to tell the truth, Julien Guiomar did not coddle himself. He indeed appeared in over thirty plays with Jean Vilar's famed Théâtre National Populaire (TNP); he was in more than forty TV films, in which his incredible presence allowed him to embody such figures as Alexandre Borgia or Diafoirus in Molière's Le malade imaginaire (1971). His film parts are even more numerous and include authority figures (colonels, police commissioners, prelates and even God Himself in Arthur Joffé's curious comedy Let There Be Light (1998). As of his first two appearances, in Philippe de Broca's King of Hearts (1966), as a lunatic who takes himself for a bishop and in Louis Malle's The Thief of Paris (1967) as a phony priest, Julien Guiomar has imposed an image of authority tinged with eccentricity. Always colorful in his expression, he can also exert sheer spitefulness (the colonel in Costa-Gavras Z (1969)) or warm humanity (the surgeon of Serge Korber's Je vous ferai aimer la vie (1979)). He may have been in too many campy comedies but he saves them from total crassness by his mere inspired presence. Julien Guiomar retired in 2004 after a final TV Film.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc3NTYxOTE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE4MzI1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0347453","name":"Julien Guiomar","idIMDB":"nm0347453"},"actorId":"nm0347453","character":"Grandfather","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pierre Bourgault","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0099877","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 January 1934","placeOfBirth":" East Angus, Québec, Canada","bio":"Pierre Bourgault was born on January 23, 1934 in East Angus, Québec, Canada.

He joined the National Film Board (NFB) in 1963, where his feature-length documentary on the textile industry, On est au coton (1970), was so controversial it was suppressed for 6 years. He made another fine documentary, Québec: Duplessis et après... (1972), before leaving the NFB for the private sector. La maudite galette (1972), Réjeanne Padovani (1973) and Gina (1975) were distinctive views of Québec society, original and provocative. All 3 used the gangster film as a source while distorting many of its conventions. He then moved to TV, scripting the Duplessis (1978) series for Radio-Canada and directing 3 episodes of Empire, Inc. (1985). He returned to the NFB to make a documentary on the 1980 referendum, Le confort et l'indifférence (1982), which revealed growing cynicism about the political process. It won the Québec Critics Prize. He returned to commercial filmmaking after a hiatus of 10 years with Le crime d'Ovide Plouffe (1984), before achieving major success with the scathing comedy about sexual mores, The Decline of the American Empire (1986) (The Decline of the American Empire), a film that won numerous prizes, including the prestigious Critic's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The New York Film Critics voted it Best Foreign Film in 1986 and it won Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the 1987 Genies. It was also nominated as Best Foreign Film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science. Jesus of Montreal (1989) confirmed Arcand's international reputation, winning the Jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. It won 10 Genies, including Best Picture and Director, and was nominated in the Best Foreign Film category by the Academy. Arcand then moved into English-language production in an attempt to break into a larger international market. De l'amour et des restes humains (1993), his first feature in English, was followed by Stardom (2000), a film that looked at the world of fashion. Neither achieved the subtlety and texture of his earlier work. The overwhelming success of The Barbarian Invasions (2003), which marked both a return to the French language and to the characters who had peopled The Decline of the American Empire (1986), showed that Arcand had lost none of his powers of observation. The film won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival (best screenplay, and best actor for Marie-Josée Croze), Best Canadian Feature Film at the Toronto International Film Festival and the prestigious Oscar for Best Foreign Film. In 2005 Arcand was named Companion of the Order of Canada, which recognizes individuals for exceptional achievements of national or international significance.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3ODY4MjkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDYwNjg0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000780","name":"Denys Arcand","idIMDB":"nm0000780"},"actorId":"nm0000780","character":"Director","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Germain Houde","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396355","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 December 1952","placeOfBirth":"","bio":"Germain Houde was born on December 14, 1952.
