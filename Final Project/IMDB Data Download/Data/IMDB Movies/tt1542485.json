Anger developed into one of the pioneers of the American underground film movement. His gritty, violent, often homosexual-themed films were too strong for American audiences of the time, and many of his productions were filmed in Europe, mainly France. However, Anger is best known for authoring the landmark \"Hollywood Babylon\" books, which detailed a far more seamier side of the Hollywood film industry than most people were aware of.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001910","name":"Kenneth Anger","idIMDB":"nm0001910"},"actorId":"nm0001910","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robin Antin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0031077","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMTczNjIzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTA3MjA1._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 July 1961","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles County, California, USA","bio":"Regarded as one the most highly respected choreographers in the business, Robin Antin has incorporated her innate passion for the art of dance and her deeply rooted drive into a long roster of top-quality projects.

After his parents divorced, he was raised by his father. In 1983, he got his first taste of stand-up comedy when he performed at open microphone nights at the University of Iowa. Tom's comedy career had its ups and downs over the next several years until 1988, when he entered the Minneapolis Comedy Competition and won first place. With this victory in hand, he decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue a stand-up comedy career. Once he hit Los Angeles, things happened fast. That same year, he was hired as a staff writer for Roseanne Barr's TV sitcom Roseanne (1988) and began to appear regularly on the show as \"Arnie Thomas\". He and Roseanne Barr were married in 1990, with Arnold converting to Judaism prior to the marriage. They formed Rapello County Productions to develop projects for themselves. The couple's marriage, together with their sometimes outrageous behavior, attracted media attention - and especially that of the tabloids - like a magnet. In 1994 conditions between the two deteriorated and they went through a very public, and acrimonious, divorce. Tom has been married twice since then and is the co-host of Fox Sports Net's talk show The Best Damn Sports Show Period (2001). He also does voiceover work, and provides the voice for the \"Oven Mitt\" character in the TV commercials for the Arby's restaurant chain.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NTYzNzMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc2NzgzMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000792","name":"Tom Arnold","idIMDB":"nm0000792"},"actorId":"nm0000792","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dan Aykroyd","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000101","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MDA3NTg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM5ODgz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 July 1952","placeOfBirth":" Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Daniel Edward Aykroyd","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Daniel Edward Aykroyd was born on July 1, 1952 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to Lorraine Hélène (Gougeon), a secretary from a French-Canadian family, and Samuel Cuthbert Peter Hugh Aykroyd, a civil engineer who advised prime minister Pierre Trudeau.
