He developed and performed nearly 400 distinct character voices with precision and a uniquely expressive vocal range. The legendary specialist from radio programs, television series, cartoon shorts and movie was rarely seen by his audience but his voice characterizations were famous around the world. Blanc under exclusive contract until 1960 to Warner Brothers voiced virtually every major character in the Warner Brothers' Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies cartoon pantheon. Characters including Porky Pig, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Wile E. Coyote,The Roadrunner, Yosemite Sam, Sam the Sheepdog, Taz the Tazmanian Devil, Speedy Gonzalez, Marvin the Martian, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé la Pew, Charlie the Dog, Blacque Jacque Shellacque, Pussyfoot, Private Snafu among others were voiced by Blanc. After 1960, Blanc continued to work for Warner Brothers but began to work for other companies once his exclusive contract ended. He worked for Hanna-Barbera voicing characters including Barney Rubble, Dino the Dinosaur, Cosmo Spacely, Secret Squirrel, Captain Caveman, Speed Buggy, Wally Gator among others. He provided vocal effects for Tom & Jerry in the mid 1960's working with fellow Warner Bros. alum, Chuck Jones at what would become MGM Animation. In the mid 1960's, Blanc originated and voiced Toucan Sam for the Kellogg's Fruit Loops commercials. He would later go to originate and voice Twiki for Buck Rodgers and Heathcliff in the late 1970's and early 1980's.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMjc2MTgzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY5MzM3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000305","name":"Mel Blanc","nicknames":["The Man of a Thousand Voices"],"idIMDB":"nm0000305"},"actorId":"nm0000305","character":"Daffy Duck / Porky Pig / Sylvester / Highwayman / J.L. / Elmer Fudd","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027422","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0042928","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042928","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["7 min"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color (Technicolor)"],"aspectRatio":["1.37 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Technicolor, USA"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.5","filmingLocations":[],"rated":"APPROVED","awards":[],"votes":"1,460","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0026840","name":"Warner Bros."}],"keywords":{"keywords":["sword fight","wedding","england","swashbuckler","volcano","dam","cavalry","lightning","parachute","inn","sneezing","tower","letter","reference to errol flynn","spoof title","damsel in distress","canceled wedding","reference to porky pig","reference to elmer fudd","reference to daffy duck","melodrama","spoof","secret identity","parody","scarlet pimpernel","mask","looney tunes","title spoken by character"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 11:06:37"}}
