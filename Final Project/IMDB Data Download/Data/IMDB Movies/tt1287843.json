This was the first time MTV had ever invited anyone from the United States to the music channel in Asia. With very little knowledge and grasp of the Mandarin Chinese language, Allan had to quickly learn the language in order to work in the Mandarin medium of Taiwan, which he successfully mastered after an intense nine months of classes and private tutoring. Allan then moved to Singapore and ignited his career there as an actor and also as a host, where he is one of the most sought after hunks on screen. His acting credits include leading roles in both English and Chinese serial dramas in addition to feature films. With an endless appetite for action and adventure, Allan landed the coveted spot as the host of The Amazing Race Asia. The hugely popular and highly-rated production is telecast throughout all of Asia and has introduced the entire region to Allan Wu. Not one to ever be complacent and rest on his laurels, Allan continually pushes his limits and tests his abilities with new challenges and projects. It is this inherent commitment to excel that major companies such as Tag Heuer luxury watches, True Yoga and True Fitness centers, Carlsberg beer, and Taylor's University-Malaysia are proud to have selected him as their brand ambassador and spokesperson.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWVjNTJhNzgtN2RkOS00MWJlLWE1ODAtYzFmNWNlY2M4MGVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MTI5NzQ@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289295","name":"Allan Wu","idIMDB":"nm1289295"},"actorId":"nm1289295","character":"Tang Ge","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Aowei Xing","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3122149","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Aowei Xing is an actor, known for Kung Fu Hip-Hop (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3122149","name":"Aowei Xing","idIMDB":"nm3122149"},"actorId":"nm3122149","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yang Yang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3122954","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Yang Yang is an actor, known for Fall of Ming (2013), Zao an Beijing (2003) and Kung Fu Hip-Hop (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3122954","name":"Yang Yang","idIMDB":"nm3122954"},"actorId":"nm3122954","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yinger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4967524","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQwNTM2YWMtZDhiMy00ZmEzLWJiZWEtMzI3ZWFkOThjNjNhL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MTI5NzQ@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 December 1988","placeOfBirth":" Changde, Hunan, China","birthName":"Ying Liu","bio":"Yinger was born on December 12, 1988 in Changde, Hunan, China as Ying Liu.
