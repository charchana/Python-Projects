Beginning with her debut performance in Cheerleader Academy (1986), Blondi demonstrated a fiery passion in each role she undertook. Her only boy/girl scenes were done with her then boyfriend Tony Montana, but she did plenty of lesbian flicks to keep everyone happy. She and Montana broke up towards the end of her career, which is one of the reasons she quit doing porn. She made only 50 films from 1986 to 1988. She also had a career as a mud-wrestler at Hollywood's Tropicana Club during that time. Since then she has gone on to be a successful feature dancer working around the country. Many people complained that her body was a bit too hard or muscular at times, as she was very athletic looking. She started doing porn with small breasts, but soon got them enlarged to the point where they looked too fake! Blondi's best work can be seen in The Adultress (1987), Dirty Blondes (1987) and What Ever Turns You On (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089067","name":"Blondi","idIMDB":"nm0089067"},"actorId":"nm0089067","character":"Perfect Girl #3","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Terri Lynn Peake","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0668851","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 May 1962","placeOfBirth":" San Diego, California, USA","birthName":"Teresa Lynn Peake","bio":"Terri Lynn Peake was born on May 11, 1962 in San Diego, California, USA as Teresa Lynn Peake.
