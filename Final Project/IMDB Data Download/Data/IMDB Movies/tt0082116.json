Susan Swift, brown haired and brown eyed with a winning smile, made her film debut at 13 in Robert Wise's supernatural drama Audrey Rose (1977), in which she gave a stunning performance as Ivy, a young girl who is plagued by horrific nightmares about burning to death in a car crash, which are believed to be her last memory in a previous life. Holding her own alongside Marsha Mason and Anthony Hopkins, Susan was able to convey childish innocence in the role of Ivy, and could also turn on the tears in the more intense scenes. The following year, she played Barbara Eden's mousy daughter Dee in the comedy Harper Valley P.T.A. (1978), then took a four year break. Reincarnation had been the big theme of Audrey Rose (1977), and it was again with her next movie Burned at the Stake (1982), a little seen but very impressive film about the 17th century Salem witch trials. Some television work came Susan's way in the 1980s, but filmgoers had to wait until 1995 before she hit the cinema screen once again!","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1ODAwMDYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM3MzcyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842630","name":"Susan Swift","idIMDB":"nm0842630"},"actorId":"nm0842630","character":"Loreen Graham / Ann Putnam","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0164693","main":true},{"actorName":"Albert Salmi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0758692","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjAxNDE2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUxMjkxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 March 1928","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","birthName":"Alfred Salmi","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Albert Salmi was born on March 11, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York, to Finnish parents. After serving in the Army during WWII, he used the GI Bill to study at the Dramatic Workshop of the American Theater Wing and the prestigious Actors Studio. He became a stage actor, very soon landing on Broadway, where his role as Bo Decker in \"Bus Stop\" was his biggest stage success. A compromise between the stage and screen was live TV drama, in which he was cast regularly. His portrayal of Bruce Pearson in the The United States Steel Hour (1953)'s live 1956 broadcast of \"Bang the Drum Slowly\" was heart-tuggingly poignant. Salmi's very first film appearance was a choice role in The Brothers Karamazov (1958), for which he turned down an Oscar nomination. The National Board of Review succeeded in presenting him with its award for the same picture, however. Salmi came to enjoy film work and actively sought out parts in westerns. He became a very familiar presence, especially on the TV screen, where he guest starred in many of the westerns and other series of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1967 he was presented with the Western Heritage (Wrangler) Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame for his role in the Gunsmoke (1955) episode entitled \"Death Watch\". This bronze cowboy on horseback became his most cherished award. Salmi demonstrated his versatility, however, as years went on. Tall, brawny and sometimes quite intimidating, he was often cast as the bad guy or the authority figure. He was equally convincing, though, as a wronged or misunderstood good guy or a good-natured sidekick. A method actor, Salmi had the ability to make you love or hate his character. He was, in real life, quite different from most of the characters he played. A quiet-natured family man, he was an oddity by glitzy Hollywood standards. Many of his friends and co-stars have commented on his sense of humor and his lack of pretense. In semi-retirement, he shared his knowledge of theatre by teaching drama classes in Spokane, Washington, where he and his wife settled.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjAxNDE2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUxMjkxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0758692","name":"Albert Salmi","idIMDB":"nm0758692"},"actorId":"nm0758692","character":"Capt.

The son of singing performer Harry Stockwell and Nina Olivette (she also went by the name Betty Veronica), their mother sent both Dean and Guy to an open call for a 1943 Broadway show entitled \"The Innocent Voyage,\" which was to star famed acting teacher Herbert Berghof. The play needed about a dozen children and, by chance, both boys were cast. Dean went immediately into films for MGM and became a popular post-war child star while Guy had to wait until adulthood before coming into his own. Following high school he attended the University of California where he majored in psychology and philosophy. Guy started his career off in minor film and TV bits, then was given his big break in 1961 as a regular cast member of the outdoor sea adventure Adventures in Paradise (1959) as first mate to star Gardner McKay. He played the role for one season. Following that in 1963 he became one of 11 performers who made up the company for Richard Boone's television anthology series. Guy became a Universal contract player in 1965 and went straight into several standard tales of adventure and intrigue, including The War Lord (1965), Tobruk (1967) and Blindfold (1965). Initially promoted as a dashing Errol Flynn type in swordplay adventures and outdoor epics, the studio had him star in the remake of Gary Cooper's French Foreign Legion classic Beau Geste (1966) opposite another film up-and-comer Doug McClure. He co-starred with McClure again, this time as the villain, in The King's Pirate (1967) while vying for beauties Jill St. John and Mary Ann Mobley. He also earned the role of Buffalo Bill Cody in a remake of Cooper's The Plainsman (1966). Playing a villain again in the glossy soaper Banning (1967) with Robert Wagner and Ms. St. John, most of Guy's high-profile roles came off routine at best and the films failed at the box office. He made his last picture for Universal co-starring with Anthony Franciosa in In Enemy Country (1968) before his contract ended. Guy subsequently gravitated towards the small screen and local stage. He created the Los Angeles Art Theater along the way where he played leading roles in well-received productions of \"Hamlet\" and his own adaptation of \"Crime and Punishment.\". Gaining respect in later years as an acting teacher, he wrote a textbook for actors called Cold Reading Advantage (1991) and taught acting (as an alumnus at the University of California) for two years in their masters program. Subsequent character parts in films were a bit offbeat to say the least, having gained some weight over time. He was also involved in extensive voice-over work. Married and divorced three times, he had two children, Doug and Victoria, by first wife Susan; an adopted son, Kerry, by second wife Sandy; and had several stepchildren by his marriage to third wife Olga. Guy suffered from diabetes in later years and died of complications in 2002. He was 68.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWViOTQ3ZmUtZmIwZS00NzA2LWFmODgtNzY2N2U4ZWJkMmU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzk3NTUwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0830967","name":"Guy Stockwell","idIMDB":"nm0830967"},"actorId":"nm0830967","character":"Dr. Grossinger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tisha Sterling","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827594","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNjQ1MjExMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5ODEzMjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 December 1944","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Patricia Ann Sterling","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Tisha Sterling was born on December 10, 1944 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Patricia Ann Sterling.
