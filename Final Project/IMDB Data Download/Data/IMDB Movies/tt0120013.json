Bonham Carter was born May 26, 1966 in Golders Green, London, England, the youngest of three children of Elena (née Propper de Callejón), a psychotherapist, and Raymond Bonham Carter, a merchant banker. Through her father, she is the great-granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert H. Asquith, and her blue-blooded family tree also contains Barons and Baronesses, diplomats, and a director, Bonham Carter's great-uncle Anthony Asquith, who made Pygmalion (1938) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), among others. Cousin Crispin Bonham-Carter is also an actor. Her maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callejón, was a Spanish diplomat who was awarded the honorific Righteous Among the Nations, by Israel, for helping save Jews during World War II (Eduardo's own father was a Czech Jew). Helena's maternal grandmother, Hélène Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family from France, Austria, and Germany, and later converted to her husband's Catholic faith. Bonham Carter experiencing family dramas during her childhood, including her father's stroke - which left him wheelchair-bound. She attended South Hampstead High School and Westminster School in London, and subsequently devoted herself to an acting career. That trajectory actually began in 1979 when, at age thirteen, she entered a national poetry writing competition and used her second place winnings to place her photo in the casting directory \"Spotlight.\" She soon had her first agent and her first acting job, in a commercial, at age sixteen. She then landed a role in the made-for-TV movie A Pattern of Roses (1983), which subsequently led to her casting in the Merchant Ivory films A Room with a View (1985), director James Ivory's tasteful adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel, and Lady Jane (1986), giving a strong performance as the uncrowned Queen of England. She had roles in three other productions under the Merchant-Ivory banner (director Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala): an uncredited appearance in Maurice (1987), and large roles in Where Angels Fear to Tread (1991) and Howards End (1992). Often referred to as the \"corset queen\" or \"English rose\" because of her early work, Bonham Carter continued to surprise audiences with magnificent performances in a variety of roles from her more traditional corset-clad character in The Wings of the Dove (1997) and Shakespearian damsels to the dark and neurotic anti-heroines of Fight Club (1999). Her acclaimed performance in The Wings of the Dove (1997) earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination, a BAFTA Best Actress nomination, and a SAG Awards Best Actress nomination. It also won her a Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics, the Boston Society Film Critics, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Texas Society of Film Critics, and the Southeastern Film Critics Association. In the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late '90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson's Live from Baghdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass' The Theory of Flight (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn's La nuit des rois (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his Mighty Aphrodite (1995); Mort Ransen's Margaret's Museum (1995); Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990). Other notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O'Sullivan's The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Big Fish (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch. In between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann's Miami Vice (1984) as Don Johnson's junkie fiancée, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall's heart in Dancing Queen (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White. Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton's film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton's massive hit Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton's spooky Corpse Bride (2005), and co-starring in Conversations with Other Women (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart. Since their meeting while filming Planet of the Apes (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton have made seven movies together. They live in adjoining residences in London, sharing a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, 4, and Nell Burton, who was born December 15, 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair. Despite that, Bonham Carter has said in numerous interviews that her audition process for the role of Mrs. Lovett was the most grueling of her career and that, ultimately, it was Sondheim who she had to convince that she was right for the role.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzUzMDg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA5NDMwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000307","name":"Helena Bonham Carter","idIMDB":"nm0000307"},"actorId":"nm0000307","character":"Karen Knightly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0177025","main":true},{"actorName":"Kristin Scott Thomas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000218","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc2MjQ1MzE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU4NDU1OQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1960","placeOfBirth":" Redruth, Cornwall, England, UK","birthName":"Kristin Ann Scott Thomas","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Kristin Scott Thomas was born in Redruth, Cornwall, England, to Deborah (Hurlbatt) and Lieutenant Commander Simon Scott Thomas.

In his teens he became a punk rocker and even found work as a circus clown and in traveling comedy troupes. In 1983 he made his professional stage debut in \"The Killing of Mr. Toad\" and went on to co-star with Harvey Fierstein in the London production of \"Torch Song Trilogy.\" It didn't take long for somebody to take note of Rupert's boyish good looks and offbeat versatility. By the mid-80s he was a presence in quality films and TV, primarily period pieces such as his Freddy Honeychurch in A Room with a View (1985) and the gay drama Maurice (1987). Rupert moved to the front of the class quickly. His decisions to select classy, obscure arthouse films as opposed to box-office mainstream may have put a dimmer on his star, but earned him a distinct reputation as a daring, controversial artist in the same vein as Johnny Depp. In A Handful of Dust (1988) he essayed the role of a penniless status seeker who beds down a married socialite; in Different for Girls (1996) he was the lover of a male-to-female transsexual woman; in The Innocent Sleep (1996) he played a derelict drunk; and in the award-winning Intimate Relations (1996) he portrayed an aimless boarder who has a relationship with both the mother/landlady and her daughter. Equally adept at costume and contemporary drama, Rupert more recently earned rave reviews on Broadway with \"Closer\" in 2000 and \"The Elephant Man\" in 2002. Rupert is currently married to production coordinator Susie Lewis.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MzUwNzk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzM5NjEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001291","name":"Rupert Graves","idIMDB":"nm0001291"},"actorId":"nm0001291","character":"Oliver Knightly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0177025","main":true},{"actorName":"Martin Clunes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167340","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NjE2NTQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3MjcxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 November 1961","placeOfBirth":" Wimbledon, South London, England, UK","birthName":"Alexander Martin Clunes","height":"6' 2½\" (1.9 m)","bio":"Martin Clunes was born the son of the noted Shakespearean actor Alec Clunes.

He then won a regular role in No Place Like Home (1983), a fairly traditional middle-class BBC sitcom starring William Gaunt.

Subsequently joined the Old Vic, where among other roles he played \"the Dauphin\" to Richard Burton's \"Henry V\". Left the Old Vic under less than happy circumstances and had even less luck with the Royal Court. Spent some time in France, where he briefly considered remaining, but returned to the UK and spent some seven years working in television and low-paying quickie films. In 1966, played one of the leads in Tom Stoppard's teleplay Thirty-Minute Theatre: Teeth (1967) -- an instant artistic rapport was the result, as was a second Stoppard role in Thirty-Minute Theatre: Another Moon Called Earth (1967), a sort of proto-Jumpers. Critical and commercial break came with the role of \"Guil\" in the NYC run of Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, for which he received a Tony nomination. Back in the UK, won Most Promising Actor award in 1970 for his role in the Harold Pinter production of James Joyce's \"Exiles\". Invited to join the RSC, he began a series of highly individual Shakespearean roles, as well as more popularly-based efforts. His \"Sherlock Holmes\" in 1974 was reprised in NYC, resulting in a second Tony nomination. The following year, the New York run of Stoppard's \"Travesties\" -- in which he starred as \"Henry Carr\" -- gave him the Tony for Best Actor. Additional theatre work in America: \"Tartuffe\", \"Deathtrap\" and \"Amadeus\". UK theatre work included \"Devil's Disciple\", \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\", \"Undiscovered Country\", \"Man Who Came To Dinner\", title role in \"Richard III\", \"Prospero\" in \"Tempest\", \"Lear\" in \"King Lear\" and, of course, \"A.E.

It was a long road to eventual stardom, during which she struggled to raise a family after a broken marriage. She became best-known for her roles in The Vicar of Dibley (1994) and The Royle Family but her talents encompassed serious drama too. And while she made something of a name playing slightly dotty old ladies, the real Liz Smith was far removed from these on-screen personas. She was born Betty Gleadle in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. Her early life was not happy. Her mother died in childbirth when she was just two years old and her father abandoned her when he remarried. \"My father was a bit of a sod, really. He just went off with loads of women and then married one who said he had to cut off completely from his prior life and that meant me.\" She started going to the local cinema with her grandfather when she was four and she quickly gained a fascination for acting. By the age of nine, she was appearing in local dramatic productions, often playing the part of elderly ladies. World War Two thwarted her plans and she joined the WRNS because, as she later told the BBC's Desert Island Discs, she loved the cut of the naval uniform. She continued appearing in plays and entertainments while serving in the Royal Navy. She met her future husband Jack Thomas while she was stationed in India and the couple married at the end of the war. Her grandmother had left her enough money to buy a house in London. Smith later remembered that she had picked it at random from a magazine and bought it without crossing the threshold. But what had been an idyllic marriage failed shortly after the family moved to Epping Forest in Essex and she was left to bring up her two children alone. With money tight, she worked in a number of jobs including delivering post and quality control in a plastic bag factory. But her love for acting remained and she began buying the theatrical magazine, The Stage, and sending her photograph to casting agents. Eventually she became part of a group studying method acting under a teacher who had come to the UK from America. She performed at the Gate Theatre in west London and spent many years in repertory, as well as spells as an entertainer in Butlins holiday camps. In 1970, she was selling toys in London's Regent Street when she got a call from the director Mike Leigh to play the downtrodden mother in his film Bleak Moments. Leigh cast her again in Hard Labour, part of the BBC's Play for Today series, a role that allowed her to shine. She received critical acclaim as the middle-aged housewife who endures a life of domestic drudgery, constantly at the beck and call of her demanding husband and daughter. It was the breakthrough she had sought for years and, as she later recalled: \"I never went back to grotty jobs again.\" She was seldom off the screen over the next 20 years, with appearances in a number of TV programmes including Last of the Summer Wine, The Sweeney, The Duchess of Duke Street and The Gentle Touch. She was cast as Madame Balls in the 1976 film The Pink Panther Strikes Again, but her scenes were left on the cutting-room floor. However, she did appear in the role six years later in The Curse of the Pink Panther. In 1984 she received a Bafta for Best Supporting Actress when she played Maggie Smith's mother in the film A Private Function. Two years later she appeared as Patricia Hodge's alcoholic mother in the BBC drama The Life and Loves Of A She Devil. It was a part, she said, that she really enjoyed as it gave her the chance to wear more glamorous outfits than her usual roles required. And she was able to dress up again for her next film appearance, this time in the role of Grace in Peter Greenaway's film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. She was still much in demand at the beginning of the 1990s, appearing in the sitcom 2point4 Children and in the series Lovejoy and Bottom. In 1994 she became a household name with her portrayal of Letitia Cropley in the series The Vicar of Dibley (1994). The character was famous for her idiosyncratic recipes such as parsnip brownies and lard and fish paste pancakes, but was killed off in 1996. Two years later Liz Smith starred as Nana in The Royle Family, a sitcom that ran for nearly four years. She took the part again in 2006 in a special edition in which Nana died. Typically, she attributed her success to Caroline Aherne's scripts rather than her own talent. \"They were great roles,\" she later remembered. \"I was so lucky that things did come my way then.\" Unlike some actors, she watched recordings of her own performances looking for ways in which she could improve her acting. She continued to appear in feature films, playing Grandma Georgina in Tim Burton's 2005 version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and she was the voice of Mrs Mulch in Wallace & Gromit -The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. In 2006 she published her autobiography Our Betty and moved into a retirement home in north London but continued acting. She appeared in the BBC's Lark Rise to Candleford, finally announcing her retirement in 2008 at the age of 87. It was a belief in her own talent that drove Liz Smith on when her life was at a low ebb. \"All I wanted was a chance,\" she told the BBC. \"It was wonderful when it did happen.\" Smith died on Christmas Eve 2016. She was 95.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTY5MTcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyODU5MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0809131","name":"Liz Smith","idIMDB":"nm0809131"},"actorId":"nm0809131","character":"Winnie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anita Dobson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0229886","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMDM5OTAyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE3NDQ3NjE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 April 1949","placeOfBirth":" Stepney, London, England, UK","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Anita Dobson was born on April 29, 1949 in Stepney, London, England.
