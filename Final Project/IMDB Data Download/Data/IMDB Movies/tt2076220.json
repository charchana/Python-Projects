Cut to a man sleeping on twin bed with a sleeping dog next to another empty twin bed with the same sheets. He gets up and looks out the window and we see he is next to an airport. One of the walls is covered in wallpaper with skinny bare trees. He puts his ear to the wall. There is a hole in the wall and he looks through it but we don't know if he can see anything. He has a metal instrument on the middle finger of his right hand. He sticks the instrument into the hole in the wall. His hand shakes a little and he turns the instrument. This allows him to open a door in the wall. The dog joins him as he steps through the door. There is a set of double doors and he steps through them.

In college, she began acting, studying underneath acting coach Ivana Chubbuck. This led to her desire to appear in feature films. Though taking many smaller roles in movies, she was little known until playing the girlfriend of Denzel Washington's character in Training Day (2001). Since then, she has been featured in a wider range of roles, from comedic to dramatic. These gave her the ability to work with many highly regarded directors, such as Robert Rodriguez (Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003)), Carl Franklin (Out of Time (2003)), John Singleton (2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)), Antoine Fuqua (Training Day (2001)) and the Farrelly Bros. (Stuck on You (2003)). Eva has co-starred in an independent film, The Wendell Baker Story (2005) with Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell, with Luke Wilson directing. Before that, her biggest movie was Hitch (2005), a romantic comedy that had her playing opposite Will Smith. Along with acting, Eva is employed by Revlon Cosmetics as an international spokeswoman. She joins such elite actresses and models as Julianne Moore, Halle Berry and Cindy Crawford, who appear in Revlon's television and print ads. She is also a passionate supporter and active participant in Revlon's fight against breast cancer. Eva's goals are to improve her acting skills by working with such contemporary directors as Steven Soderbergh, Spike Jonze and Pedro Almodóvar, and learning from such renowned directors as Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MDQwMDI4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc1OTU1NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0578949","name":"Eva Mendes","idIMDB":"nm0578949"},"actorId":"nm0578949","character":"Kay M","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kylie Minogue","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001541","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMDIxMTM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkzMDU2MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 May 1968","placeOfBirth":" Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","birthName":"Kylie Ann Minogue","height":"5' (1.52 m)","bio":"Kylie Ann Minogue was born on 28 May, 1968. The eldest of three children, Kylie's acting career began early, but it was her role as \"Charlene\" in the Australian soap, Les voisins (1985), which established Kylie as an international star. Her singing career began, purely by accident, when a record company executive heard Kylie's rendition of Little Eva's 1962 hit, \"The Loco-Motion\". She signed with PWL Records and hit-makers Stock/Aitken/Waterman in 1987. Five albums and a greatest hits compilation followed, and she made history by having more than 20 consecutive top ten hits in the UK. Her motion picture debut came with the starring role of \"Lola\" in The Delinquents (1989). She left PWL Records in 1992 to head in a decidedly more mature musical direction, and her self-titled debut on deconstruction records was released in 1994, spawning chart hits like \"Confide In Me\" and \"Put Yourself In My Place\". Kylie's doings were always a favorite subject of the press, but she really made waves with her controversial 1995 duet with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\". 1997 saw the release of Kylie's first single in more than 3 years, \"Some Kind of Bliss\", co-written and produced by James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore of The Manic Street Preachers.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMDIxMTM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkzMDU2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001541","name":"Kylie Minogue","nicknames":["The Princess of Pop"],"idIMDB":"nm0001541"},"actorId":"nm0001541","character":"Eva Grace","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elise Lhomeau","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3921940","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Elise Lhomeau is an actress, known for Holy Motors (2012), L'avenir (2016) and Des filles en noir (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3921940","name":"Elise Lhomeau","idIMDB":"nm3921940"},"actorId":"nm3921940","character":"Léa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeanne Disson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4392658","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Jeanne Disson is an actress, known for Holy Motors (2012), Tomboy (2011) and Les salauds (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4392658","name":"Jeanne Disson","idIMDB":"nm4392658"},"actorId":"nm4392658","character":"Angèle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michel Piccoli","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0681566","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ4MjE3NjQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIyMDMxNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 December 1925","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Jacques Daniel Michel Piccoli","height":"5' 11¾\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Born in a musician's family, he spent the first fifteen years of his career appearing both on stage and on screen, mostly in supporting roles.

The film played at the 1984 Cannes film festival and was a critical triumph. It paved the way for Carax's second feature Mauvais Sang (1986) (Bad Blood). That film was a giant step forward in the same direction that he was going in with his first film. Both films were visually stunning and focused on young love and also alienation. With his reputation and talent at its peak, he set out to make what seemed it seemed like would be another triumph. The Lovers on the Bridge (1991) (The Lovers on the Bridge) was the result of three long years of very difficult production; Carax spent a fortune building some of the sets and filming some mind-blowing sequences. Unfortunately, neither critics nor audiences favored what was a truly grand vision of the themes he dealt with in his first two films. Carax went into an a 8 year long exile, but finally returned with Pola X (1999). It was a departure from his other films and another critical flop.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MDM3NDIxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTEyNzA4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136021","name":"Leos Carax","idIMDB":"nm0136021"},"actorId":"nm0136021","character":"Le Dormeur / Voix Limousine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nastya Golubeva Carax","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5077698","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nastya Golubeva Carax is an actor, known for Holy Motors (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5077698","name":"Nastya Golubeva Carax","idIMDB":"nm5077698"},"actorId":"nm5077698","character":"La Petite Fille","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Reda Oumouzoune","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4918144","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Reda Oumouzoune is known for his work on Holy Motors (2012), Maattrraan (2012) and Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4918144","name":"Reda Oumouzoune","idIMDB":"nm4918144"},"actorId":"nm4918144","character":"L'Acrobate Mocap","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Zlata","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2361009","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"Julia Günthel","bio":"Zlata was born in Kysl Orda, Kazakhstan as Julia Günthel.
