During the war years, she was touted in Nazi propaganda as an ideal of Germanic femininity. Her association with members of the regime, including the ever roving-eyed Joseph Goebbels, damaged her career in the aftermath of World War II. Nonetheless, she would reemerge in the 1950's as a more versatile actress, if not a bigger star. Mady Rahl was strong-willed and had a commanding, almost aristocratic air about her. Most of all, she possessed that quality called pizzazz. From her early teens, Mady was determined to seek a career in the performing arts. In the process, she financed her expensive acting (at the Ilka Grüning School) and dance classes by doing secretarial work (being an adept typist and stenographer). Rumour has it, that she got her start on the stage (in Leipzig) without having to sit for an audition. Her looks and comportment seemed entirely sufficient. Film work came in due course, after she met a young director named Detlef Sierck (who later found fame and fortune in Hollywood as Douglas Sirk). He starred her in his first film (a short comedy) as, perhaps unsurprisingly, a secretary. Having signed a four-year contract with Ufa, she found herself in yet another clerical role for The Mysterious Mister X (1936). Her first critical acclaim arrived courtesy of a role in the lavish circus drama Le saut de la mort (1937), in which she co-starred alongside the dancer La Jana. Then followed a succession of small roles in big Ufa productions like To New Shores (1937) and Allo Janine (1939) and leads in lightweight romantic comedies (notably Mademoiselle (1939) and Die lustigen Vagabunden (1940), opposite Johannes Heesters). By the mid-1940's, Mady had become one of the most celebrated stars of German films. After a post-war hiatus, her screen career was reinvigorated with a handful of dramatic character roles as mysterious or genteel women in prestige pictures like The Lady in Black (1951), UB 55, corsaire de l'océan (1957) and L'étau (1958). In the early 1960's, Mady returned to the theatre, going on tour with the Munich-based 'Kleine Komödie'. She also became a popular TV guest star, seemingly omnipresent in prime time cop shows. She was also busily doing voice-overs for diverse American actresses, from Gillian Anderson to Arlene Francis. By the mid-1990's, the thrice-married actress had wound down her performing career to concentrate on her other vocation as a successful painter and exhibitor of water colours. Almost blind and afflicted by dementia, Mady Rahl died in August 2009 at the respectable age of 94.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0706703","name":"Mady Rahl","idIMDB":"nm0706703"},"actorId":"nm0706703","character":"Edith Marquardt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Erich Dunskus","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0243017","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 July 1890","placeOfBirth":" Pillkallen, East Prussia, Germany","bio":"Erich Dunskus was born on July 27, 1890 in Pillkallen, East Prussia, Germany.

He appeared in many theatres throughout his country in the 30s including Heidelberg, Bonn, Bremen, Stuttgart, Baden-Baden and Berlin. In early 40s films, WWII interrupted his output for a time, but, in a many, the war never left him, for he would continue playing war-time colonels, generals, and field marshals for the duration of his career. Following more theatre and radio work, he concentrated again on films in the 50s and could hardly be seen out of uniform for the many prototype Nazi officers he ably portrayed. He branched out internationally and kept his uniform starched and pressed for many more prestigious international productions including The Longest Day (1962), The Cardinal (1963), The Train (1964) Von Ryan's Express (1965), and Anzio (1968) as the nemesis of such American \"heroes\" as Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, William Holden, Richard Burton, Peter Falk and Frank Sinatra. He played Rommel in Raid on Rommel (1971) and Field Marshal Von Rundstedt in Richard Attenborough's A Bridge Too Far (1977). He would appear in over 100 German and international productions in his lifetime. His film infamy was only heightened after playing the archvillain Dr. Mabuse in a series of German crimers, the first being Fritz Lang's The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960). In his twilight years he turned more and more to TV, his last appearance being in 1997. He was part of the ensemble cast of \"The Winds of War\" and \"War and Remembrance\" in the 80s Married three times, Preiss died at the age of 92 as the result of a fall.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMTIyNzU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTgxNTUxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007234","name":"Wolfgang Preiss","idIMDB":"nm0007234"},"actorId":"nm0007234","character":"Dr. Beck","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tatjana Iwanow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0412577","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 May 1925","placeOfBirth":" Berlin, Germany","bio":"Tatjana Iwanow was born on May 14, 1925 in Berlin, Germany.
