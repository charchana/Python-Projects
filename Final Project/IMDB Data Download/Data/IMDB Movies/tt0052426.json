She was a professor's daughter from Djursholm, Stockholm, Sweden. After graduation she went to Paris to learn French and by chance got a role in the short film Hur behandlar du din hund? (1934). In 1935, she studied history of art in Berlin and attended acting classes. There she got to know her future husband Veit Harlan. During WWII Kristina Söderbaum played the main parts in popular Nazi propaganda movies under the direction of her husband Veit Harlan. Between 1939 and 1945 they made together the successful films Covered Tracks (1938), The Immortal Heart (1939), The Trip to Tilsit (1939), La ville dorée (1942), Le lac aux chimères (1943), The Great Sacrifice (1944) and Kolberg (1945). The most infamous was Le juif Suss (1940), a strong antisemitic propaganda film. Three years after \"Jud Süss\" she became an honoury student at Uppsala University, Sweden. Söderbaum said after the war that she regretted the films, but she never made a comeback as a popular actress. She didn't work until Harlan was allowed to direct again in 1950 and then appeared mostly in his films and on German TV until the 1990s. After Harlan's death in the 1964, she also established herself as a fashion photographer in Munich, Germany and wrote her memoirs, \"Nichts bleibt immer so\", in 1983. On 12 February 2001, she died in Hitzacker, Lower Saxony, Germany.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWQxZDIwNmMtMGNmNC00ZWI5LTk0ZmItYTliYTQzMTU1ZWY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0845453","name":"Kristina Söderbaum","nicknames":["Reichswasserleiche","Blond Ambition","Blonde Bitch of Goebbels","The Queen of UFA","Perpetually Raped","The Rape Queen"],"idIMDB":"nm0845453"},"actorId":"nm0845453","character":"Annemie Müller","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Walter Giller","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0318854","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZhOGQzNWEtZGFiNC00NDI2LTk3NmYtNzk2NmFjOGE0NjcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 August 1927","placeOfBirth":" Recklinghausen, Germany","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Walter Giller was born on August 23, 1927 in Recklinghausen, Germany.

Encouraged to pursue acting after successful screen testing in Berlin, she went on to pursue drama studies in Vienna at the Reinhardt Seminar (1943-1945) at night, while conscripted to work in an armaments factory during the daytime. Following the end of the war, Vera, trying to supplement her meagre income, was caught up in black market activities and spent sixteen months in an Austrian prison. Her life changed dramatically, when she was discovered singing at a cafe during the Salzburg opera season by the director Géza von Cziffra, who changed her name to Molnar and starred her as wordly, emancipated women in several of his films, notably Gabriela (1950), Une fille du tonnerre (1950) and the romantic musical comedy Le Rêve multicolore (1952), the most lavish production thus far undertaken in post-war Germany. At the same time, Vera and her (married) Svengali conducted a not entirely discreet affair, living together at a rented house in Hamburg. U.S. immigration authorities subsequently denied her a visa and thereby the opportunity to act in Hollywood due to her 'criminal past'. From the mid-1950's, Vera continued to pop up in a brace of undistinguished international productions, which did little for her rapidly waning career. By the end of the decade, she called it quits. Having established dual residencies in Rome and Vienna in the 1960's, she committed her remaining years to the muse of painting.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597193","name":"Vera Molnar","idIMDB":"nm0597193"},"actorId":"nm0597193","character":"Marion Dehl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hans Nielsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0630821","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 November 1911","placeOfBirth":" Hamburg, Germany","birthName":"Hans Albert Nielsen","bio":"Hans Nielsen was born on November 30, 1911 in Hamburg, Germany as Hans Albert Nielsen.
