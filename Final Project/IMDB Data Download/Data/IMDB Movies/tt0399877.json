She has two older brothers. Her family is of Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent. Marlee lost much of her hearing at the age of eighteen months. That did not stop her from acting in a children's theater company at age seven; she was Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Her deafness never held her back. As an adult she said it so eloquently: \"I have always resisted putting limitations on myself, both professionally and personally.\" Marlee studied criminal justice at Harper College in Palatine, Illinois, and maintained her passion for acting after graduating. While performing on stage throughout Chicago and the Midwest, Marlee attracted notice for her performance in a production of the Tony Award-winning play \"Children of a Lesser God\" and was cast in the movie version, Children of a Lesser God (1986). Although this was her film debut, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. While shooting her next movie, Walker (1987), in Nicaragua, big-hearted Marlee took time to visit both hearing and hearing-impaired children. She continued this tradition of visiting local children throughout her travels to Germany, England, Italy, Australia, Mexico, Canada, etc. Her interest in the criminal justice field played a part in her on screen career; she portrayed an assistant D.A. in the TV series Reasonable Doubts (1991), while off screen she married police officer Kevin Grandalski on August 29, 1993. The couple has four children. Marlee was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1994 for her performance as Laurie Bey in the Picket Fences (1992) episode \"Dancing Bandit.\" Marlee is also a spokeswoman for the National Captioning Institute. In 1995, she testified at a congressional hearing and helped get a law passed that requires all TV sets 13 inches or larger to be manufactured with built-in chips to provide closed captioning on their screens; this was a godsend for deaf viewers. Marlee serves as the national spokeswoman for the largest provider of TV closed captioning, and has spoken on behalf of CC in countries such as Australia, England, France, and Italy. She also serves on the boards of a number of charitable organizations, including Very Special Arts, the Starlight Foundation, and other charities that primarily benefit children. As someone who loves children so much, it is only fitting that she has four of her own. Professionally, Marlee has even tried producing, being the executive producer for Where the Truth Lies (1999).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMjAxMzI0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIyOTgyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0559144","name":"Marlee Matlin","idIMDB":"nm0559144"},"actorId":"nm0559144","character":"Lead","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elaine Hendrix","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005006","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMDc3NzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMxNzM2OTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 December 1970","placeOfBirth":" Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA","birthName":"Katherine Elaine Hendrix","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Elaine Hendrix spent her early years in nearby Knoxville and Morristown.

The adventures of this rebel without a cause certainly shows its age nowadays, but back then it had the requisite existential feel and most certainly was a symbolic sign of the times a la Peter Fonda's Easy Rider (1969). Newman showed himself off as the new kind of brooding anti-hero that the average-looking Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino were making popular at the time. Newman didn't hit the kind of heights that Hoffman and Pacino achieved, but has continued on solidly for three decades in tough-talking supports. Barry was born in 1938 in Boston, to an Austrian Jewish father and a Russian Jewish mother. He graduated from Brandeis University with a degree in anthropology, but turned to acting and the New York scene after \"crashing\" a class at the Actor's Studio. Throughout the 1960s, he appeared on stage in such plays as \"Night Life\", \"The Mouse Trap\" and \"What Makes Sammy Run?\" A couple of minor films came his way, including Pretty Boy Floyd (1960). It was his hard-hitting role in The Lawyer (1970) that finally opened the doors needed to get ahead and then Vanishing Point (1971). His cocky, self-assured presence made him even sexier than he appeared. He carried this attitude into his own TV series Petrocelli (1974), in the 1970s, playing a hot-shot attorney but, following the show's demise, his career flattened out. An obvious talent, Newman's later films such as Amy (1981), Daylight (1996) and The Limey (1999) have managed to keep him in the public eye.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjA3NDUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE4ODU5NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628017","name":"Barry Newman","idIMDB":"nm0628017"},"actorId":"nm0628017","character":"Frank","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Larry Brandenburg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104594","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0Mzc0MzY5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA1NTU4Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 May 1948","placeOfBirth":" Wabasha, Minnesota, USA","bio":"Larry Brandenburg was born on May 3, 1948 in Wabasha, Minnesota, USA.
