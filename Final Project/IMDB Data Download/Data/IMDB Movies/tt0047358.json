He finished school at the age of 15 and began to work as a baker. He was already playing harmonica, mandoline and cornet when he engaged himself in a village band. In the beginning of 1940 while in the army making music-hall show for the troops, he changed his name into Andrel like his idol Fernandel from whom he was singing the songs. He began to write his own songs, making a name by himself, and so in 1942 took a new name, further from \"Fernandel\": Bourvil(le). He was recognized as a stand-up comic, dressed as a farmer grown too fast for the shirt he wears, hair coming down on his forehead, a simple minded but crafty naive. At the end of the war the radio extended his fame. His first parts on the screen were based only on this character. It's only in 1956 with Four Bags Full (1956) of Claude Autant-Lara that he really began to give his real potential as an actor on the screen. His greatest popular successes will come under the direction of Gérard Oury.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3NTIxODM3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDIyMjg3NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0100186","name":"Bourvil","idIMDB":"nm0100186"},"actorId":"nm0100186","character":"Émile Dupuy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Annie Cordy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179684","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M5NGZhMjQtYTEzZi00ZTllLWIzNWQtNmIyNzM5Mzk3ZWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 June 1928","placeOfBirth":" Schaerbeek, Brussels, Belgium","birthName":"Léonie Cooreman","bio":"Annie Cordy was born on June 16, 1928 in Schaerbeek, Brussels, Belgium as Léonie Cooreman.
