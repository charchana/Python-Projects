She is the daughter of the famed Flo Fabert. She co-owns a chain of boutiques in Quebec with her brother, Philippe. But Bibi's life is in shambles. She has just had an abortion. And the boutiques are failing because of her incompetence, which is the result of or has led to her substance abuse. It is also the result of the high expectations on her. Bibi's story is told by a fish awaiting decapitation on a butcher's block, the fish as narrator largely because of the singular and accidental encounter she has with fifty-three year old Norwegian fishmonger, Annstein Karlsen. That encounter leads to a further failed decision by Bibi and a meeting with Annstein's son, Evian Karlsen, who does not know the full extent of Bibi and his father's relationship. Bibi's time with Evian may provide some salvation to her crumbling life.","simplePlot":"After plunging her car into a river, a woman encounters a man who helps her come to terms with her life.","actors":[{"actorName":"Marie-Josée Croze","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0189887","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ODcxNDg5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0ODA4NDE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 February 1970","placeOfBirth":" Montréal, Québec, Canada","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Marie-Josée Croze first studied fine arts before opting for the stage at La Veillée-Prospero Theatre workshop in Montreal. In 1993 she got her first movie part in La Florida (1993) and started working for numerous Canadian TV series and movies. In 2000, with her performance in Denis Villeneuve's Maelstrom (2000) she got national (Jutra and Genie best actress awards) and international recognition, and began shooting with some of the most acclaimed Canadian directors: Atom Egoyan for Ararat (2002) and Denys Arcand for The Barbarian Invasions (2003), for which she got the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003. After the Cannes award many French directors used her incredible versatility: she played a mysterious and glamorous movie star in Ordo (2004), adapted from Donald E. Westlake's novel, a single mother overwhelmed by her responsibilities in Jean-Pierre Denis' drama La petite Chartreuse (2005), a down-to-earth architect in the romantic comedy Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinités...
