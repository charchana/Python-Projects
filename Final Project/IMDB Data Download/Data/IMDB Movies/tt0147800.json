During his tour is when Cameron first sees Bianca Stratford, a beautiful sophomore with one problem: she isn't allowed to date.

But Kat and Bianca's father alters his house rule: now, Bianca can date... as long as Kat has a date, too. Now, in order for Cameron to date Bianca, he has to find someone to date Kat. So Michael helps him enlist the help of pretty-boy/jerk/model Joey Donner, tricking him into thinking that *he* will get to take Bianca out if he pays someone to take out Kat.

He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break. His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Summer Bay (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga. Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000). What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster's Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005), for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a B.A.F.T.A. Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. After his death he received more than thirty posthumous awards for his portrayal as the psychopathic clown prince of crime in The Dark Knight (2008) (including the Oscar, S.A.G., B.A.F.T.A., and Golden Globe)","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NTY0NzA4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE1MDE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132","name":"Heath Ledger","nicknames":["Heathy"],"idIMDB":"nm0005132"},"actorId":"nm0005132","character":"Patrick Verona","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004049","main":true},{"actorName":"Julia Stiles","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005466","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNjUxNDk3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM0NjA0NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 March 1981","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Julia O'Hara Stiles","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Julia O'Hara Stiles was born on March 28, 1981 in New York City, the outgoing daughter of a Greenwich Village artist mother, Judith Newcomb Stiles, and an elementary school teacher father, John O'Hara. She is the eldest of three children, and has Irish, English, and German ancestry. Encouraged to take modern dance lessons at an early age, she was introduced to Shakespeare and theater. At age 11, she made her debut as a child actress with the experimental off-Broadway La MaMa Theatre. Her passion grew and by the next year was performing professionally and working in commercials. A bright, precocious student, she was seriously considered for the child vampire role of Claudia in Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) but lost out in the end to Kirsten Dunst. She continued training at New York's Professional Children's School and, at 15, made her cinematic bow with I Love You, I Love You Not (1996) with Claire Danes. Next featured as the daughter of Harrison Ford in The Devil's Own (1997), her breakout role came on TV with the hard-hitting mini-movie Before Women Had Wings (1997), which was produced by Oprah Winfrey and dealt with child abuse. Her wish to play Shakespeare was granted threefold with her participation in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), which was based on the Bard's \"The Taming of The Shrew\" and won her the Chicago Film Critics Award as the volatile teen Kat; an updated version of Hamlet (2000) which paired her Ophelia with Ethan Hawke; and another updated version of \"Othello\" entitled O (2001), which had her high school character of Desi (Desdemona) involved in a mixed romantic relationship with African-American Mekhi Phifer. The violent-edged film was made in 1998 but not released until three years later due to the tragic Colorado student shootings at Columbine High School. In addition, Julia later portrayed Viola off-Broadway in a Shakespeare-in-the-Park production of \"Twelfth Night\" in 2002. She temporarily interrupted her career after deciding to enroll at Columbia University in 2000, where she earned a degree in English. Stiles has also returned to the stage, appearing in David Mamet's \"Oleanna\" in London, a role she would reprise on Broadway in 2009, opposite Bill Pullman and directed by Doug Hughes. Moving into mainstream roles by the millennium, she took on a role that would carry her through the decade, co-starring with Matt Damon in popular Bourne series: The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). During the time between Bourne films, she appeared in ensemble dramas, appearing opposite Julia Roberts in Mona Lisa Smile (2003), won offbeat notice in the title role of Carolina (2003) with Shirley MacLaine and Randy Quaid. She also returned to her indie film roots, with films such as Between Us (2012) and the comedy farce, It's a Disaster (2012). In 2010, she switched gears and headed to series television, joining the cast of Dexter (2006) for the show's fifth season in the role of Lumen Pierce, a performance that earned her nominations for both the Golden Globe and the Emmy for Best Supporting Actress. In 2012, she followed up with another series, Blue (2012), which airs on YouTube, while preparing for cinematic roles in Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and The Bell Jar (2018).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNjUxNDk3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM0NjA0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005466","name":"Julia Stiles","idIMDB":"nm0005466"},"actorId":"nm0005466","character":"Katarina Stratford","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0531289","main":true},{"actorName":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzOTg0NTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4MTcwOQ@@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1981","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Joseph Leonard Gordon-Levitt","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"Joseph Leonard Gordon-Levitt was born February 17, 1981 in Los Angeles, California, to Jane Gordon and Dennis Levitt. Joseph was raised in a Jewish family with his late older brother, Dan Gordon-Levitt, who passed away in October 2010. His parents worked for the Pacifica Radio station KPFK-FM and his maternal grandfather, Michael Gordon, had been a well-known movie director. After working for several years as a child actor, Joseph became better known for starring on the hit television series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996), for which he earned two Hollywood Reporter Young Star Awards. In addition, the show earned three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Outstanding Peformance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Prior to his success on television, Joseph had already worked steadily in feature films, debuting in the Robert Redford film A River Runs Through It (1992). He won a Young Artist Award for the latter film. During the 1990s, he also co-starred in the films Angels in the Outfield (1994), The Juror (1996), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), and 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). Following his work on 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996), Joseph took time off from acting to attend Columbia University. In the early 2000s, he broke from the mold of his television and film comedy supporting roles by appearing in a string of intense dramatic roles, mostly in smaller, independent films such as Manic (2001), with Don Cheadle; Mysterious Skin (2004), for writer/director Gregg Araki; Rian Johnson's award-winning debut film, Brick (2005); Lee Daniels' Shadowboxer (2005); the crime drama The Lookout (2007), which marked Scott Frank's directorial debut; John Madden's Killshot (2008), with Diane Lane and Mickey Rourke; and the controversial drama Stop-Loss (2008), in which he starred with Ryan Phillippe, under the direction of Kimberly Peirce. By 2009, Joseph was officially established as one of the leading men of indie cinema with his Golden Globe-nominated role in the comedy-drama 500 Days of Summer (2009), for which he also received an Independent Spirit Award nod. He also adapted the Elmore Leonard short story Sparks into a 24-minute short film that he directed (Sundance Film Festival 2009). In 2010, he headlined the indie drama Hesher (2010) and also established himself as a mainstream star in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010). Balancing both independent and Hollywood film, Joseph scored another Golden Globe nod for the cancer drama 50/50 (2011), directed by Jonathan Levine and also starring Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, and Bryce Dallas Howard. He worked again with director Nolan on The Dark Knight Rises (2012) (for which he received a People's Choice Award nomination for Favorite Movie Actor), and snagged leading roles in both Premium Rush (2012), directed by David Koepp, and Looper (2012), for which he reunited with his Brick director, Rian Johnson, and starred opposite Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. Also in 2012, he played Abraham Lincoln's son Robert in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-nominated Lincoln (2012), with Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field. In 2013, Joseph Gordon-Levitt starred in his critically-acclaimed feature film directorial debut, Don Jon, from a script he wrote, opposite Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for \"Best First Screenplay\" for the film. Gordon-Levitt provided the voice of Jiro Horikoshi in the 2014 English-language version of Hayao Miyazaki's Academy Award-nominated animated feature The Wind Rises, and appeared in Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014), in which he played Johnny, a character Miller created for the film. Gordon-Levitt founded and directs hitRECord, an open collaborative production. hitRECord creates and develops art and media collectively using their website where anyone with an internet connection can upload their records, download and remix others' records, and work on projects together. When the results of these RECords are produced and make money, hitRECord splits the profits 50/50 with everybody who contributed to the final production. hitRECord has published books, put out records, gone on tour and has screened their work at major festivals including Sundance and TIFF. \"RegularJOE\" (as he's known on the site) is leading the community of over 300, 000 artists in its biggest collaboration yet, a new take on a variety show called \"HitRecord on TV!\" The half hour series, which Gordon-Levitt hosts, premiered in January on Participant Media's new cable network, Pivot and has been renewed for a second season.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzOTg0NTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4MTcwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","nicknames":["Joe","Joey","JGL","Regular Joe"],"idIMDB":"nm0330687"},"actorId":"nm0330687","character":"Cameron James","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004056","main":true},{"actorName":"Larisa Oleynik","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0646351","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNjU4NTI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE2NTMyODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 June 1981","placeOfBirth":" Santa Clara County, California, USA","birthName":"Larisa Romanovna Oleynik","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Larisa was born in Santa Clara County, California, to Lorraine (Allen), a nurse, and Roman Oleynik, an anesthesiologist.

He was first recognized for his gregarious performance of teen rebel \"Zack Dell in the cult-classic film Camp Nowhere (1994). Barely in high school, Roland Emmerich cast Keegan in the blockbuster Independence Day (1996). After an immediate rise in popularity, the charismatic actor guest-starred on many hit shows before being cast on the TV drama Party of Five (1994). That same year, he landed another recurring role on 7th Heaven (1996), the WB's longest-running hit series, on which he played a single teenaged father in love with Jessica Biel's character Mary. Keegan showed his range from comedy to drama in two modern-day Shakespearean film adaptations. His hilarious performance as the antagonist of Heath Ledger in the comedy 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) was balanced by a solid dramatic performance as Mekhi Phifer's best friend in O (1995), which was directed by Tim Blake Nelson. A bold choice in his career, Keegan accepted the lead role in Greg Berlanti's critically acclaimed The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy (2000), which showed a more vulnerable side of his acting range as the newbie. The film won best picture that year at the GLAAD Awards. Expanding his range in 2009, Keegan made his theatrical stage debut in the provocative award winning play \"He Asked For It.\" Keegan stepped on stage as Rigby, a character tackling the emotional issues of being HIV-positive in modern-day society. In 2010, Keegan jumped into the cockpit as Strayger, a drug-smuggling pilot in the high-octane action film Kill Speed (2010). Innovative camera technology allowed the adrenaline-driven actor to give his performance while doing aeronautical stunts in mid-flight. Alongside William Sadler and John Heard, Keegan took on a darker role as a sadistic and sociopathic vampire named Blake in the film Living Among Us (2017).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTQ3NTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQzNzI5Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005080","name":"Andrew Keegan","nicknames":["Keegan"],"idIMDB":"nm0005080"},"actorId":"nm0005080","character":"Joey Donner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004077","main":true},{"actorName":"Susan May Pratt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006721","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4MTEwOTM2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE5MjE0NDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 February 1974","placeOfBirth":" Lansing, Michigan, USA","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Susan May Pratt was born on February 8, 1974 in Lansing, Michigan, USA.

She also studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. Early in her career Janney got comedic roles in the soap operas As the World Turns (1956) and Guiding Light (1952). Later, she gave memorable movie performances in supporting roles in Belles à mourir (1999), 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), American Beauty (1999) and Nurse Betty (2000), and in the made-for-TV movie ...First Do No Harm (1997), among others. Among her stage work, Janney has played in a revival of Arthur Miller's \"A View From the Bridge\" on Broadway opposite Anthony LaPaglia, which earned her a Tony Award nomination, and a Drama League Award for outstanding artist for the 1997-98 season. She played in Noel Coward's \"Present Laughter\" opposite Frank Langella, which earned her the Outer Critics Circle Award and an Actors' Equity award. Janney also appeared in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"The Taming of the Shrew\". In 1999 Janney became part of the original cast of the acclaimed TV series The West Wing (1999) where she played the President's press secretary who eventually gets promoted to the White House Chief of Staff. Her impressive work during the seven seasons of that renowned series earned her four Emmys and two SAG Awards. With her reputation becoming more broadly established during her work on \"The West Wing\" Janney won more substantive roles in feature films, in the acclaimed The Hours (2002) where she was Meryl Streep's lesbian lover, and in How to Deal (2003) where she played Mandy Moore's mother.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNjc2NzgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyMjM1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005049","name":"Allison Janney","idIMDB":"nm0005049"},"actorId":"nm0005049","character":"Ms. Perky","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004073","main":true},{"actorName":"David Leisure","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500601","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMDc0OTg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQxMTQz._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 November 1950","placeOfBirth":" San Diego, California, USA","birthName":"David Russell Leisure","bio":"During his student-actor days at San Diego State University, Leisure roomed with Robert Hays.
