Each generation faces its own unique set of challenges. Up against corporate corruption, the trials and tribulations of the cultural revolution, and one's duty to nation in time of war, they are faced with choosing their individual paths through history. But as the challenges and turmoil of each generation may differ as time changes, what was learned in the past cannot help but effect the choices that are made in the future as it is passed down from generation to generation. And that is the universal message that being true to yourself is precious. It is the source of strength that empowers one to become the person they want to be, to march forward as far as their hearts desire, into the future.","simplePlot":"From World War, to revolution and ultimately rebirth, Forever Young is the story of four generations spanning a hundred years of modern Chinese history.

The sixth of seven children, Russell Wong was born in Troy, New York; the son of restaurateur William Wong and Dutch-American artist Connie Van Yserloo. When Russell was seven years of age, his parents divorced, and he moved with his mother to California, settling near Yosemite. Russell attended Santa Monica College. As a trained dancer and a martial artist, Russell is able to perform many of his own stunts. Russell made his big screen debut in James Clavell's \"Tai Pan\". He made a memorable guest appearance on the drama series \"21 Jump Street\" and won a leading role in Wayne Wang's acclaimed independent romantic comedy \"Eat a Bowl of Tea\". Supporting roles in \"China Cry\" and \"New Jack City\" soon followed. In 1993, Russell gained critical acclaim for his outstanding performance in \"The Joy Luck Club\". Russell scored a high-profile role in 1994, when he was cast in the leading role in the made-for-TV movie \"Vanishing Son\" produced by Rob Cohen, in which he played a Chinese political activist exiled in America. The show was popular enough to spawn three sequels, and was later spun off into a syndicated TV series. People magazine named him one of the \"Fifty Most Beautiful People\" in 1995. After \"Vanishing Son\" ran its course, Russell moved on to more big-screen work, including major roles in \"Takedown\", co-starring Skeet Ulrich, and \"Twisted\" with Sam Jackson and Ashley Judd. His breakthrough performance opposite Jet Li in \"Romeo Must Die\" firmly established Russell's star power. Russell is next seen in this summer's blockbuster \"Mummy 3\" directed by Rob Cohen, as well as \"Dim Sum Funeral\" a black comedy co-starring Bai Ling and Kelly Hu. He will star alongside Ving Rhames in the martial arts thriller \"Unshakable\" this Fall.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyOTcyNDA3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODczNjcxNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005568","name":"Russell Wong","idIMDB":"nm0005568"},"actorId":"nm0005568","character":"General","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chen Yao","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3209720","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjA2NjRkZDAtNjQ2NS00MWNmLTg2MTEtNjAyOWEyZWU4MjllL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MTI5NzQ@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 October 1979","placeOfBirth":" Nanping, Fujian, China","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Yao studied at Beijing Dancing Academy From 1993 to 1997, graduated from Beijing film academy in 2003.
