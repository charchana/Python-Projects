He lives in a decrepit slum with his wheelchair-bound father, whom he treats quite badly. One day, a new family of neighbours move in, and the sexy younger daughter, Amparito, catches his eye, so he becomes a friend of Rafi, her nerdy brother, to get closer to her. At the same time, he discovers that a band of drug traffickers are operating in a nearby chinese restaurant; he knows that if he cracks this case, it could make him regain the status he lost within the police department; but the only people he can count on to help him are Rafi and his equally nerdy friends.","simplePlot":"José Luis Torrente, a former policeman fights against the oriental mafia in Madrid.","actors":[{"actorName":"Santiago Segura","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0782213","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTA0NTE1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ2NTAxNA@@._V1_UY44_CR12,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 July 1965","placeOfBirth":" Madrid, Spain","birthName":"Santiago Segura Silva","height":"5' 7¾\" (1.72 m)","bio":"Born in Madrid, Santiago Segura started his career by making his first short movie at the age of fourteen.
