That he became an actor comes as no surprise considering that his mother, Rosa Albach-Retty, was a star of the Viennese stage. Of course, Magda Schneider, the woman he married in 1936, was an actress. And logically indeed they begot another famous actress by the name of ... Romy Schneider. Unfortunately, being Romy's father is probably Wolf Albach-Retty's greatest claim for glory, for despite his acting talents he privileged - lock, stock and barrel - commercial cinema, opting for romance films, superficial musicals and mediocre comedies which pleased the crowds but did not make film history. Too bad because his acting talents would have been welcome in the world of Max Ophüls, Wolfgang Liebeneiner or Helmut Käutner, among others. His theater career was much more satisfactory, notably his acclaimed performances in plays by Athur Schnitler.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDIzM2U5NjMtY2FhYi00OTRiLTk3MjUtYTkwMzNiNzIxY2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0016208","name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","idIMDB":"nm0016208"},"actorId":"nm0016208","character":"Martin Palmer, junger Komponist","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elfe Gerhart","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0314308","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM0OGQ3NmQtOWFkNi00MTc0LWI3NjUtYWY5N2IxYTgzZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 July 1919","placeOfBirth":" Vienna, Austria","birthName":"Elfriede Gerhart","bio":"Elfe Gerhart was born on July 10, 1919 in Vienna, Austria as Elfriede Gerhart.
