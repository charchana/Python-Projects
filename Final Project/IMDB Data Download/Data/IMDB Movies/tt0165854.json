The New York-born actress (born in 1946) is the daughter of a night club singer, Margot Warren (née Verblow), and a real estate agent, William Warren. Her parents were of Russian Jewish descent. Warren's mother gave up her own entertainment career for marriage and family. Lesley attended New York's Professional Children's School and eventually studied under Lee Strasberg at his Actors Studio, the youngest student to be accepted at the time (age 17). The freckled, talented hopeful gathered musical stage experience in such shows as \"Bye Bye Birdie\" playing swooning teen Kim McAfee. She made her illustrious Broadway debut in \"110 in the Shade\", the 1963 musical version of \"The Rainmaker,\" and won the \"Most Promising Newcomer\" Award. She subsequently received the Theatre World Award for her work in the 1965 tunefest \"Drat! The Cat!\" The attention she received immediately led to her capturing the beguiling title role in the Rodgers and Hammerstein TV musical production of Cinderella (1965). Although sweet-voiced stardom was certainly hers on a silver platter, she didn't necessarily carry the sweet tooth for it. Her impact as Cinderella led to her signing with the Walt Disney Studio as their principal ingénue. Co-starring in the rather blah musical showcases The Happiest Millionaire (1967) and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968) further convinced her that she needed to nip the saccharine stereotype in the bud if she was to grow as an actress and sustain some type of career longevity. Rebelling against her studio-imposed image, she left Disney determined to pursue roles with more depth, drama and character. Changing her name temporarily to \"Lesley Warren\" to reinforce her goal, she replaced Barbara Bain in the long-running espionage series Mission: Impossible (1966) in 1970, but the audiences were quite cool in their reception to the \"new and improved\" Lesley and didn't buy her as a femme-fatale replacement for the cool and aloof Ms. Bain. After only one season, she left the show and sought greener pastures in the TV mini-movie market playing a wide range of vulnerable neurotics as well as sexy, worldly ladies. She made her mark in such sudsy 1970s material as Love Hate Love (1971) co-starring 'Ryan O'Neal (I)'; The Legend of Valentino (1975); the rags-to-riches story Harold Robbins' 79 Park Avenue (1977), for which she won a Golden Globe award; the epic WWII story Pearl (1978); Betrayal (1978); and Portrait of a Stripper (1979). In the early 1980s, Lesley's movie career resurrected itself with a priceless performance as kingpin James Garner's whiny-voiced, peroxide-blonde spitfire Norma Cassady in the musical film slapstick Victor Victoria (1982). The role won her nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe, as well as winning a New York Film Critics Award and a People's Choice Award. This scene-stealing turn led to a couple of other quality offbeat films: Choose Me (1984) and Songwriter (1984), along with the usual quota of TV projects. Warren received nominations for a Golden Globe for Songwriter, and a People's Choice Award for Choose Me. She also matured into a steamy, sexier \"older woman\" type and earned some worldly roles opposite various gorgeous young guns, including Christopher Atkins in the critically-drubbed A Night in Heaven (1983). Her riotous \"dumb blonde\" act had Hollywood discovering her potential as a scatter-brained comedienne, an image she has reinforced over the years with recurring TV guest parts on such popular shows as Will & Grace (1998) and Desperate Housewives (2004). Warren's television credits also include a Golden Globe Award performance for Best Actress in the miniseries 79 Park Avenue. She also was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy for her role in the CBS miniseries Family of Spies. Warren received a Cable Ace nomination for her work in Tennessee Williams' 27 Wagons Full of Cotton. She also received Cable Ace and Golden Globe nominations for her work in HBO Pictures' Baja Oklahoma. Further television credits include leading roles in the NBC telefilm Evergreen, and the Emmy winning TNT miniseries Joseph (opposite Ben Kingsley). Warren appeared on five seasons of the USA Network drama In Plain Sight, as well as the 100th episode of Psych, a tribute to the movie Clue. Warren recently appeared in three films: Babysitter, The Sphere and the Labyrinth, and Michael co-starring James Franco and Zachary Quinto. From Cinderella to sexy mamas, the effervescent Lesley is still going strong in a career now hitting four-and-a-half decades. Lesley has a son, Christopher Peters, from her 1967-1977 union to makeup artist/hair stylist-cum-film producer Jon Peters. Since 2000, she has been married to advertising exec Ronald Taft, a former v.p. at Columbia and sometime actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MTcyMzc4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTcyNjY0MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000690","name":"Lesley Ann Warren","idIMDB":"nm0000690"},"actorId":"nm0000690","character":"Elaine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0015523","main":true},{"actorName":"Luis Guzmán","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350079","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyNjIyOTU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk3ODcxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 August 1956","placeOfBirth":" Cayey, Puerto Rico","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Actor of Puerto Rican descent who made many memorable films in the 1980s due to his villainous persona.

The adventures of this rebel without a cause certainly shows its age nowadays, but back then it had the requisite existential feel and most certainly was a symbolic sign of the times a la Peter Fonda's Easy Rider (1969). Newman showed himself off as the new kind of brooding anti-hero that the average-looking Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino were making popular at the time. Newman didn't hit the kind of heights that Hoffman and Pacino achieved, but has continued on solidly for three decades in tough-talking supports. Barry was born in 1938 in Boston, to an Austrian Jewish father and a Russian Jewish mother. He graduated from Brandeis University with a degree in anthropology, but turned to acting and the New York scene after \"crashing\" a class at the Actor's Studio. Throughout the 1960s, he appeared on stage in such plays as \"Night Life\", \"The Mouse Trap\" and \"What Makes Sammy Run?\" A couple of minor films came his way, including Pretty Boy Floyd (1960). It was his hard-hitting role in The Lawyer (1970) that finally opened the doors needed to get ahead and then Vanishing Point (1971). His cocky, self-assured presence made him even sexier than he appeared. He carried this attitude into his own TV series Petrocelli (1974), in the 1970s, playing a hot-shot attorney but, following the show's demise, his career flattened out. An obvious talent, Newman's later films such as Amy (1981), Daylight (1996) and The Limey (1999) have managed to keep him in the public eye.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjA3NDUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE4ODU5NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628017","name":"Barry Newman","idIMDB":"nm0628017"},"actorId":"nm0628017","character":"Jim Avery","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Dallesandro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0198072","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MjUzMjQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI3OTgwMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 December 1948","placeOfBirth":" Pensacola, Florida, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Joe Dallesandro's still hangin' . . . after battles with drug addiction and alcohol, brushes with the law, three broken marriages and numerous love affairs, plus the suicide of his only sibling Bob. One of the most beautifully photographed wild guys to come out of the Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey \"Factory\" era, the slight and slightly androgynous Dallesandro became an improbable pioneer of the male sexual revolution and the first film actor to be glorified as a nude sex symbol. The Morrissey/Warhol movies were known for their bizarre, amateur standing, yet Joe and his completely uninhibited, walk-on-the-wild-side demeanor managed to hold an entire underground audience captive. Joe's dangerous street mentality and raw erotic power became a definitive turn-on to both gay and straight audiences and his fame eventually filtered somewhat into the mainstream. Born humbly as Joseph Angelo D'Alessandro III in Pensacola (located on Florida's panhandle) on New Year's Eve in 1948, his parents, Joe II and Thelma, were teenagers when Joe was born; his father was a Navy man stationed there and his mother had a wild streak of her own. Joe (then age 5) and younger brother Robert were placed into a New York adoption facility after Thelma was given a five-year prison sentence for auto theft and the father decided he was unable to care for them alone. Brought up in a series of foster homes, Joe became notorious for his delinquent behavior at school -- which was often ignited by his short stature and even shorter temper. Frequent runaways, he and his brother eventually returned to live with their grandparents but Joe quickly drifted towards a life of crime (thievery, burglary, etc.) via his association with street gangs. At 15 \"Little Joe\" was caught stealing a car and sentenced to a juvenile rehab facility in New York's Catskill Mountains. During this time he started his famous \"Little Joe\" tattoo body markings. He escaped from the facility and lived a nomadic life in Mexico for a time before returning to the US (Los Angeles), where he gained unexpected acceptance in the California gay scene. The wanderlust teen found it profitable to exploit his sulky good looks and smoothly-muscled physique by posing nude for various photographers in the mid-'60s. Sometimes billed as \"Joe Catano\", Dallesandro hit many of the underground studios in both California and New York, working most notably for Robert Henry Mizer, who founded the Athletic Model Guild (AMG), and Bruce Bellas, aka Bruce of Los Angeles. A little magazine called Physique Pictorial, which was passed off as a bodybuilding publication, was, in truth, geared heavily toward its gay subscribers. Many were clients of Mizer, who photographed thousands of buff young men (some even out-of-work military servicemen) in various stages of undress from 1945-1993. Joe became Mizer's most famous model and can be seen featured in Thom Fitzgerald's docudrama Beefcake (1998), which chronicles the Mizer AMG era. Back in New York during the summer of 1967, the 18-year-old, while visiting a friend in Greenwich Village, was invited to sit in and watch Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey shooting an impromptu marathon movie in Warhol's building apartment. Morrissey's camera quickly found its way toward the ambivalent, good-looking Joe and the rest is history. Joe wound up shooting a wrestling scene with another guy clad only in his underwear. A year later that 23-minute footage found its way into The Loves of Ondine (1968), an 86-minute mishmosh of Warhol's eccentric ideas. Joe's image in his jockey shorts was used for the primary ads in The Village Voice. The movie, which featured his extended improvised wrestling scene, was reviewed by Variety and Joe himself, surprisingly, received raves for his charismatic good looks and natural acting ability, and was touted as a possible legit performer. Young Dallesandro instead became Morrissey's protégé. Although Joe displayed beefcake appeal in Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys (1968), which was investigated by the FBI for rumors of an on-screen rape, and San Diego Surf (1968), the only Warhol feature film never released, it was Morrissey's film trilogy that led to Joe's subsequent idol worship. The first, Flesh (1968), placed Joe front-and-center as a male hustler á la Midnight Cowboy (1969). Intended for female and gay audiences, Joe hit counterculture fame as the first actor to offer extensive full-frontal nudity and the movie also managed to filter successfully out to mainstream audiences. Morrissey's second feature, Trash (1970), was anointed a \"masterpiece\" and \"best film of the year\" by none other than Rolling Stone magazine. In it Little Joe plays a heroin junkie living in New York squalor with girlfriend Holly Woodlawn (Warhol's well-known transvestite actress). The last of Morrissey's trilogy, Heat (1972) takes place in the vicinity of L.A.'s Sunset Boulevard with a long, pony-tailed Joe as a cold-hearted ex-child star who beds down everyone, including seamy \"Midnight Cowboy\" actress Sylvia Miles and her lesbian daughter, in order to resuscitate his long-dormant career. This attention led to Joe's making the cover of Rolling Stone in April 1971. He was also photographed by some of the top celebrity photographers of the time, including Francesco Scavullo, and Richard Avedon. Singer/songwriter Lou Reed utilized Little Joe's identity in his pop hit \"Walk on the Wild Side\". In Europe Morrisey's films were praised even more, while Dallesandro was placed on an erotic pedestal. Acting pay was practically non-existent so Dallesandro, now a husband (to wife Leslie, who was the daughter of one of his dad's girlfriends) and father (their son Michael), received \"Factory\" pay by answering phones, checking in and checking out film prints, acting as a projectionist, handling security and even running the building's elevator. Morrissey's hot trilogy was followed by the European cult films Flesh for Frankenstein (1973) and Blood for Dracula (1974), both eclectic X-rated blood spillers and ultimate cult items. Tired of being just a gear in the Factory machinery, Joe stayed on in Europe after filming the two 1974 gorefests and decided to see if his Warhol Superstar status could trigger foreign box-office career a la the recently transported Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson. Joe made 18 feature films overseas throughout the rest of the 1970s. They were a mixture of styles: the sex-farce One Woman's Lover (1974); the gritty, grimy crime yarn The Climber (1975) [\"The Climber\"]; _Louis Malle's adult version of Alice in Wonderland, Black Moon (1975); The Streetwalker (1976) [\"The Streetwalker\"] co-starring softcore erotica star Sylvia Kristel; the sexually taunting Madness (1980) as a car thief-turned hostage taker; Jacques Rivette's surrealistic Merry-Go-Round (1981); Tapage nocturne (1979) [\"Nocturnal Uproar\"] as a self-absorbed actor; and Queen Lear (1982), a Franco-Swiss co-production in which he plays a bisexual. The best of Joe's European films, and his personal favorite, is the sexually-charged Je t'aime moi non plus (1976) [\"I Love You, I Don't\"], Serge Gainsbourg's film wherein he plays a gay garbage truck driver who has the hots for a very boyish café waitress Jane Birkin (Gainsbourg's wife at the time). Returning to the States in 1980, Joe's work became more erratic than erotic, but some of his roles have earned a bit of attention. More noteworthy was his gangster Lucky Luciano in Francis Ford Coppola\"s The Cotton Club (1984); another gangster in the Bruce Willis starrer Sunset (1988); his religious zealot in John Waters' mainstream Cry-Baby (1990); his psychotic paratrooper in Private War (1988); his trailer park scum who lusts after 'Drew Barrymore' in Guncrazy (1992); his sleazy photographer in _L.A. Without A Map (1998)_, and his brain-damaged hit man in Steven Soderbergh's The Limey (1999). On TV he made standard guest appearances on such popular shows as Miami Vice (1984), Wiseguy (1987) and Matlock (1986). The Teddy Award, an honor recognizing those filmmakers and artists who have contributed to the further acceptance of LGBT lifestyles, culture, and artistic vision, was awarded to Joe in February of 2009. A biography, \"Little Joe: Superstar\" by Michael Ferguson was released earlier in 2001 and a filmed documentary, Little Joe (2009), has been released with Joe serving as writer and producer. The thrice-married and divorced actor has two sons, Michael and Joe, Jr. Glimpsed here and there these days, he later managed a hotel in the Hollywood area.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MjUzMjQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI3OTgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0198072","name":"Joe Dallesandro","nicknames":["Little Joe"],"idIMDB":"nm0198072"},"actorId":"nm0198072","character":"Uncle John","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicky Katt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0441588","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0NzU0MDczMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzc0Mjkz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 May 1970","placeOfBirth":" South Dakota, USA","birthName":"Nicky Agustin Katt","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Nicky Katt has been acting since the age of 7, when he appeared on the TV series CHiPs (1977) in 1977.

He is the brother of actress Jane Fonda and the father of actress Bridget Fonda. His ancestry includes Dutch, English, Scottish, and distant French and Italian. Fonda made his professional stage debut on Broadway in 1961 in Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole, for which he received rave reviews from the New York Critics, and won the Daniel Blum Theater World Award and the New York Critics Circle Award for Best New Actor. He began his feature film career in 1963, playing the romantic lead in Tammy and the Doctor and joined the ensemble cast of the World War II saga The Victors. Shortly thereafter, Fonda began what would become a famous association with Roger Corman, starring in Wild Angels, as the ultra-cool, iron-fisted leader of a violent biker gang, opposite Nancy Sinatra, Bruce Dern, and Diane Ladd. Fonda also starred in Corman's 1967 psychedelic film The Trip, also starring Dern and Susan Strasberg. Fonda's next project was the seminal 1969 anti-establishment film Easy Rider which he produced and co-scripted, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Fonda's acting credits also include the feature films Outlaw Blues, an expose of the country music business; Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry; Race with the Devil; Robert Rossen's Lilith; Split Image; Robert Wise's Two People; and the cult films Love and a .45 and Nadja. He appeared in Grace of My Heart, directed by Alison Anders, and John Carpenter's Escape from L.A., starring Kurt Russell. He also made a cameo appearance in Bodies, Heat & Motion, which starred his daughter Bridget.

Following this, he published his autobiography, Don't Tell Dad, and was then seen in the NBC movie The Tempest, for which he had been nominated for another Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Mini-Series. Fonda then appeared with Helen Mirren in the Showtime telefilm The Passion of Ayn Rand, where he won the Golden Globe for outstanding supporting actor in a mini-series or movie made for television and was nominated for both an Emmy and SAG Award. Fonda co-starred in Steven Soderbergh's 1997 film The Limey, which also starred Terrence Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren. Following this he appeared in Thomas and the Magic Railroad for director Britt Allcroft, starring Alec Baldwin. Fonda directed his first feature film, The Hired Hand, in 1971.

The daughter of Pamela, a nurse, and Glenn George, a construction worker, Melissa initially expressed interest in various forms of dance rather than acting. During her childhood, George studied tap, ballet, and jazz, later transitioning into professional rollerskating - similar to figure skating on ice. By age 16, George had won several awards at various National Rollerskating Championships in Australia, and subsequently began modeling after dropping out of high school. George met a casting agent while doing modeling work, and was given a role on the popular Australian soap opera Summer Bay (1988); George moved to Sydney and worked on the show for three years until deciding to pursue other projects. In 1996, George left Australia and moved to Los Angeles in search of bigger roles. She garnered various supporting parts in films such as Dark City (1998) and Steven Soderbergh's crime thriller The Limey (1999), before landing a key part in David Lynch's acclaimed neo noir mystery film, Mulholland Drive (2001). While in Bali in 1998, George met future husband, Chilean filmmaker Claudio Dabed; the two were married in late 2000. The early 2000s would have George playing bit parts in several American television shows, including Friends (1994) and Monk (2002), ultimately landing a recurring role on the hit Alias (2001) alongside Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan. Through the later part of the decade, George had roles in various horror and thriller films, beginning with the 2005 version of The Amityville Horror (2005), as well as the commercially-successful thriller Derailed (2005) alongside Clive Owen, Jennifer Aniston and Vincent Cassel. George finished the decade with several more horror films, including Turistas (2006) and 30 Days of Night (2007), as well as independent horror titles such as The Killing Gene (2007), The Betrayed (2008) and Triangle (2009). George was also active in television work, landing a role on the popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy (2005). Her greatest critical success would come with a role on In Treatment (2008), playing the love interest of Gabriel Byrne, which would garner her a Golden Globe nomination in 2009. Though a veteran of television in both Australia and the United States, George has achieved considerable success in her film career, which has hardly spanned over a decade.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQwNzU1NDkwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEwODA1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0313534","name":"Melissa George","nicknames":["Mel","Gorgeous George","Roo"],"idIMDB":"nm0313534"},"actorId":"nm0313534","character":"Jennifer 'Jenny' Wilson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0128763","main":true},{"actorName":"William Lucking","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524747","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIwMDc5NjMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE5MDE1Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 June 1941","placeOfBirth":" Vicksburg, Michigan, USA","height":"6' 5\" (1.96 m)","bio":"William Lucking was born on June 17, 1941 in Vicksburg, Michigan, USA.
