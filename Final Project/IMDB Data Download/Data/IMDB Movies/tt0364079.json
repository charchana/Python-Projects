Beginning as a Production Assistant on Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, he soon found himself as one of the first Management Trainees under Warner Brothers Senior Vice President of Production Bill Young, allowing him to observe feature film production from the very highest level of a major motion picture studio. He later brought his knowledge to Tony Gardner's Special Makeup Effect shop, Alterian Studios, working on the likes of Army of Darkness, Cast a Deadly Spell, Sleepwalkers and the Swamp Thing television series. Burnett also spent a number of years working as a professional story analyst, reading thousands of scripts at Silver Pictures, CAA, The William Morris Agency and Pierre David's The Image Organization. Narrowing his focus to actual film production, he began his feature editorial career recutting Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment's Arcade. Throughout the 90s, he continued to edit a number of low-budget genre features, specializing in working with first-time directors and supervising the entire post-production process. Burnett made his feature directorial debut with the 1999 award-winning cult favorite Free Enterprise, starring Emmy-Winners William Shatner and Eric McCormack, which he also edited and co-wrote. It took Best Feature and Best Screenplay at the AFI FEST. In 2003 and '04, he developed and Co-Produced Agent Cody Banks and its sequel, Agent Cody Banks: Destination London for MGM. Beginning in 2000, he began writing, shooting, producing and directing content for special edition DVDs and eventually Blu Rays. His award-winning work appears on the discs for Fantasia, The Emperor's New Groove, Snow White, Tron, Valley Girl, Star Trek V and Shoot 'Em Up. In 2002, he formed his production company, Ludovico Technique, LLC, specializing in overseeing the content creation for huge, overseas productions. Ludovico spent months and sometimes years at a time in both New Zealand and Australia, embedded in such productions as The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. Burnett also teamed up with acclaimed director Bryan Singer to create the Special Editions for The Usual Suspects, X-Men, X2 and Superman Returns In 2009, Ludovico developed and produced its first feature film, The Hills Run Red, in association with Warner Premiere and Joel Silver's Dark Castle Entertainment with Burnett as producer. He went on to direct and edit five episodes of the HBO/Cinemax Late Night anthology series Femme Fatales. From 2012 thru 2014, Burnett, wrote, edited and produced over 50 hours of additional programming for the HD restoration Blu-Rays for Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Enterprise. The seven seasons of TNG won 2 Saturn Awards. 2016 sees the release of three features he's edited, the time travel thriller Paradox, the serial killer drama My Eleventh and the mystery I Know Where Lizzie Is.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ4OTEzMzYyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM1NzY3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122428","name":"Robert Meyer Burnett","idIMDB":"nm0122428"},"actorId":"nm0122428","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Casey Biggs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0081827","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM0NDA0MTQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzMTYyNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 April 1955","placeOfBirth":" Toledo, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Casey Patrick Biggs","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Casey Biggs decided to give up football and pursue an acting career while a student at Central Catholic High School in Toledo, Ohio.

The stage-trained actor who shares a striking resemblance to actor Karl Malden never found the one role that would make him a household name, but he has made up for it with a number of rich and rewarding stage, film and TV assignments bolstered by his trademark authoritarian look and stance. Born on September 26, 1932, is the son of another Richard, a railroad engineer and WWII vet who died when the boy was quite young. The younger Herd suffered from bone marrow cancer which affected the growth of his legs as a child. As a result, he was educated at the Industrial School for Crippled Children during his formative years. Luckily, loving care and several operations saved his legs from deformity. It was his mother Katherine's love of music that ignited Richard's initial desire to perform. Trained on the drums, he received early acting training on radio and in summer stock (Liberty Mutual Theatre in Boston) during his high school years and in the late 1940s studied Shakespeare under veteran Claude Rains at one point. Other plays such as \"Our Town\" and \"Sing Out Sweet Land,\" and the children's theatre productions of \"Penrod\" and \"Robin Hood\" helped to beef up his early resume. Richard enlisted in the Army during the Korean War but injured a knee in basic training which led to an honorable discharge within 90 days of his enlistment. He did, however, go on to work for the Army Signal Corps in a host of training films. Richard continued to gather experience in such classical plays as \"The Miser\" and \"A Month in the Country\". With several summer stock runs, Shakespearean bus-and-truck tours and industrial films under his belt, he finally made his New York debut in the minor role of an usher in The Dress Circle\" at Carnegie Hall. He also became a member of the Player's Club. Making a highly inauspicious film debut in the minor role of a coach in the film Hercules in New York (1970), which was the showcase debut for the massively-muscled Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard didn't settle in Hollywood until the mid 1970s after replacing actor Richard Long (who died before filming began) in the role of Watergate figure James McCord in All the President's Men (1976). Although Richard made a handful of other movies throughout the rest of the decade (I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1977), F.I.S.T. (1978), The China Syndrome (1979), The Onion Field (1979)), he appeared with much more frequency on TV, playing stern, authoritarian types on episodes of \"Kojak,\" \"The Rockford Files,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco,\" (starring the similar-looking Karl Malden), \"Rafferty,\" \"Eight Is Enough\" and \"Starsky & Hutch,\" as well as in the TV movies Pueblo (1973), Captains and the Kings (1976), The Hunted Lady (1977), Dr. Scorpion (1978), Kate Bliss and the Ticker Tape Kid (1978), Terror Out of the Sky (1978) (TV)_, Marciano (1979) (TV)_ and, most notably, Ike: The War Years (1980) in which he portrayed General Omar Bradley. Never finding the one support role that might have made him a character star, Richard has nevertheless been featured impressively on all three mediums for the past four decades. On stage he appeared in a pre-Broadway tryout of \"On the Waterfront\" and played to great applause in productions of \"Other People's Money\" and \"The Big Knife\". His finest hour on stage, however, would come with his portrayal of the epic film producer in the one-man show \"Cecil B. DeMille Presents,\" which he has toured throughout the country. On TV, Richard has guested on most of the popular TV programs of late, including \"Desperate Housewives\" and CSI: Miami\" and is probably best remembered for his recurring roles as Admiral Noyce on SeaQuest 2032 (1993), as Jason Alexander's boss Wilhelm in the sitcom classic Seinfeld (1989) and as Admiral Owen Paris in Star Trek: Voyager (1995). A few of his lightweight cinematic crowd-pleasers include Private Benjamin (1980), Deal of the Century (1983), Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987) and Sgt. Bilko (1996). On occasion Richard has moved into the director/producer/writer's chair. He directed the play \"Idle Wheels\" for the Road Theatre Company in North Hollywood, was a producer of the N.Y. play \"Agamemnon\" and co-producer (and performer) of the play \"The Couch with the Six Insides,\" and, as a playwright, had a presentation of his play \"Prisoner of the Crown\" produced at Dublin's Abbey Theatre. Married briefly at the age of 19, Richard remarried and had two children (Richard Jr. and Erica) by his second wife. That marriage also ended in divorce, but his third (in 1980), to actress Patricia Herd (Patricia Crowder Ruskin) has lasted. Patricia has a daughter from an earlier marriage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyOTgxNTUyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgzNzQ0MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378800","name":"Richard Herd","idIMDB":"nm0378800"},"actorId":"nm0378800","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dominic Keating","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444098","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI5MTY4NDgxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyODM5Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 July 1962","placeOfBirth":" Leicester, Leicestershire, England, UK","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Dominic Keating was born on July 1, 1962 in Leicester, Leicestershire, England.
