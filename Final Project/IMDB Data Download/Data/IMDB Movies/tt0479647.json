Over the five seasons he appeared in 72 of the 77 episodes. During that time he also starred in an episode of the popular Sci-Fi series \"Sanctuary\". He has been interrogated three times by Yannick Bisson; once as Miles Gorman in \"Murdoch Mysteries\", as Saul Roland in \"Sue Thomas F.B.Eye\" and as Kenny in \"Crazy For Christmas\". Howland is very proud to be a part of Canadian history, having played the Commissioner of the Hockey League, Harry Buttman, in the blockbuster feature film \"Bon Cop Bad Cop\" opposite Patrick Huard and Colm Feore. He also played the son of Canadian icon Jayne Eastwood in \"Endless Grind\". A turn on the improvised show Train 48 and a recurring role as the Computer Tech, Keach, on \"Billable Hours\" tapped into to his comedic roots. He began with improvisation and an excellent acting teacher, winning regional gold medals two years consecutively at the Improv Olympics. In 1990, Howland formed the comedy troupe \"The Four Strombones\". They performed in comedy clubs around Toronto (Yuk Yuk's Sketch Pad, Big City Improv, Lee's Palace, the Rivoli and more) for well over a decade. \"The Four Strombones\" created an audience choice Toronto Fringe Festival show in 1994, \"In Transit: 40 minutes after midnight\". His first professional role was in the feature film \"To Catch A Yeti\" opposite Meat Loaf. Howland has hosted comedy shows and wrote his own stand-up routine for \"Club Land\" directed by Saul Rubinek, screenplay by Steven Webber. He co-wrote and directed the award winning short film \"Underwritten\" for the Toronto 48-hour film festival. As of 2014, he is starring in, directing and producing Rick and Sunday's Comedy Channel on YouTube. Musically, Howland has been songwriting for almost 30 years. His 3rd and latest EP \"Hold My Hand\" was masterfully produced by Graham Ward, featuring She's a Goddess in season 4 episode 2 of \"Lost Girl\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMwZmMxMDEtMzgwMy00MDYyLTkyZGEtNDcxYzY1NWNiODUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc1MDI1OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398205","name":"Rick Howland","nicknames":["Rick"],"idIMDB":"nm0398205"},"actorId":"nm0398205","character":"Harry Buttman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0479647","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479647","business":{"budget":{"money":"$CAD8,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"$11,100,000","country":"Worldwide","day":"20","month":"10","year":"2006","remarks":""},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/2005/\">2005</a>"}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 56 min (116 min) (Canada)","2 hr (120 min) (Argentina)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Cité Lab, Canada"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm (Kodak)"],"cinematographicProcess":["Super 35"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm (anamorphic)"]},"rating":"7.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Montréal, Québec, Canada"}],"rated":"R","awards":[{"award":"Canadian Comedy Awards 2007","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Canadian Comedy Award","categories":[{"category":"Pretty Funny Film Writing","names":[{"name":"Alex Epstein","id":"nm0258420","role":null},{"name":"Patrick Huard","id":"nm0399088","role":null},{"name":"Leila Basen","id":"nm0059721","role":null},{"name":"Kevin Tierney","id":"nm0862935","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Directors Guild of Canada 2007","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated DGC Craft Award","categories":[{"category":"Direction -
