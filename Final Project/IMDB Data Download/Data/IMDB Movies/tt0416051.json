He was exposed to dramatic arts while studying at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York. He furthered his studies with Sanford Meisner and eventually made his film debut in Where's Poppa? (1970). Sorvino suffered from severe asthma, and worked hard at mastering various breathing techniques to manage the illness. He wrote a best-selling book entitled \"How to Become a Former Asthmatic\". He also started the Sorvino Asthma Foundation based in New York City. Sorvino has appeared in a variety of film, TV and theatrical productions over the the last four decades. He received critical praise for his role in the Broadway play \"That Championship Season\", and played the role again in the 1981 film alongside Robert Mitchum and Martin Sheen.
