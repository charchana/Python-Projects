When Ray Ventura and his band went to play in Brazil during World War II, Henri Salvador became popular over there as a singer and funnyman. Back in France after the war ended, Henri Salvador left Ray Ventura behind and started a career of is own. His first record, which included \"Clopin-Clopant\" and \"Maladie d'Amour\" (covered by the Ames Brothers as \"Mélodie d'Amour\") became an instant hit. Salvador, at 83, is still popular after many hits, whether they're humorous songs (\"Faut rigoler\", \"Je peux pas travailler\", \"Blouse du dentiste\", etc.) or sweet ballads (\"Le loup, la biche et le chevalier\", \"Syracuse\", \"Jardin d'hiver\").","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759230","name":"Henri Salvador","idIMDB":"nm0759230"},"actorId":"nm0759230","character":"Batifol","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sophie Agacinski","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0012806","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 December 1943","placeOfBirth":" Poligny, Jura, France","bio":"This beautiful blonde started in her early twenties as Cécile, a provincial girl who goes to Paris where she becomes a window dresser, in a successful TV serial 'Seule à Paris' (1965). At the same time comedian Jean-Marc Thibault (twenty years older than her) fell in love with her and they have shared their lives ever since. Unfortunately the popular comedies Thibault and his sidekick Roger Pierre starred in were mediocre at best ans as Sophie faithfully followed her companion into these highly forgettable films, her filmography really lacks luster as a result. After retiring as an actress, she metamorphosed into a more ambitious person: she now writes novels and scripts for the small screen and co-directs good quality TV documentaries.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0012806","name":"Sophie Agacinski","idIMDB":"nm0012806"},"actorId":"nm0012806","character":"Nicole","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Daniel Crohem","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0188529","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 December 1925","placeOfBirth":" Heuringhem, France","bio":"Daniel Crohem was born on December 11, 1925 in Heuringhem, France.
