She is of English, Welsh, Irish, and Scottish descent. Rachel became involved with acting as a teenager and by the age of 13 was performing in Shakespearean productions in summer theater camp; she went on to graduate with honors with a BFA degree in Theater from York University. After her debut in an episode of Disney's Jett Jackson (1998), she co-starred in the Canadian TV series Slings and Arrows (2003), a comedy-drama about the trials and travails of a Shakespearean theater group, and won a Gemini award for her performance in 2003. Her breakout role as Regina George in the hit comedy Mean Girls (2004) instantly catapulted her onto the short list of Hollywood's hottest young actresses. She followed that film with a star turn opposite Ryan Gosling in the adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks bestseller The Notebook (2004), which was a surprise box office success and became the predominant romantic drama for a new, young generation of moviegoers. After filming, McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved and dated through mid-2007. McAdams next showcased her versatility onscreen with the manic comedy Wedding Crashers (2005), the thriller Red Eye (2005), and the holiday drama The Family Stone (2005). McAdams then explored the independent film world with Married Life (2007), which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and also starred Pierce Brosnan, Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson. Starring roles in the military drama The Lucky Ones (2008), the newspaper thriller State of Play (2009), and the romance The Time Traveler's Wife (2009) followed before she starred opposite Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law in Guy Ritchie's international blockbuster Sherlock Holmes (2009). McAdams played the plucky producer of a failing morning TV show in Morning Glory (2010), the materialistic fiancée of Owen Wilson in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris (2011), and returned to romantic drama territory with the hit film The Vow (2012) opposite Channing Tatum. The actress also stars with Ben Affleck in Terrence Malick's To the Wonder (2012) and alongside Noomi Rapace in Brian De Palma's thriller Passion (2012). In 2005, McAdams received ShoWest's \"Supporting Actress of the Year\" Award as well as the \"Breakthrough Actress of the Year\" at the Hollywood Film Awards. In 2009, she was awarded with ShoWest's \"Female Star of the Year.\" As of 2011, she has been romantically linked with her Midnight in Paris (2011) co-star Michael Sheen.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5ODcxMDU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAzNjQyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1046097","name":"Rachel McAdams","nicknames":["Rach"],"idIMDB":"nm1046097"},"actorId":"nm1046097","character":"Christine Stanford","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0329428","main":true},{"actorName":"Noomi Rapace","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0636426","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNzg3NDkyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg2NjA2ODE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 December 1979","placeOfBirth":" Hudiksvall, Gävleborgs län, Sweden","birthName":"Noomi Norén","height":"5' 4¼\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Swedish actress Noomi Rapace is the daughter of fellow Swedish actress Nina Norén and Spanish Flamenco singer Rogelio Durán.

At the age of 15, she left home and joined the Stockholm Theatre School. Rapace went on to win the recurring role of Lucinda Gonzales in the Swedish TV series Tre kronor (1994), and also became a respected stage performer. She won critical acclaim for playing the leading role in 2007's Daisy Diamond (2007). In 2009, Rapace came to the attention of international audiences for her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009).
