She adopted the name \"Fernanda\" because she thought it sounded good. \"Montenegro\" came after her family doctor. In late 40s she was translating and adapting famous theater plays to radio. She begun her artistic life in the theater with the play \"Alegres Canções nas Montanhas\" in 1950. Among her mates was Fernando Torres, who would soon become her husband. Next she use the married name Arlette Pinheiro Monteiro Torres. In the next years she worked with other great actors like Sérgio Britto, Cacilda Becker, Nathália Timberg, Cláudio Corrêa e Castro and Ítalo Rossi. In the early 60s she moved to São Paulo where she worked on many theater plays and also stared working on television. Her first soap operas was \"Pouco Amor Não é Amor\". In 1964 she started working for cinema as well. Her first film was \"A Falecida\". In 1965 her daughter Fernanda Torres was born. She later also became a famous actress. As time went by, more and more successful soap operas and plays came up and she received many prizes. She was later called \"The First Lady of Brazilian Theater\". In cinema, after some not very famous films, she worked on \"Eles Não Usam Black-Tie\" (1981), largely applauded by the critics. Her success on television and theater continued, but her cinema career, although it never stopped, was largely unnoticed until 1997, when \"O Que é Isso, Companheiro?\", a nominee for the Oscar of Best Film in a Foreign Language, was released. In 1998 \"Central do Brasil\" enchanted the world. This film, another nominee for the Oscar, was the highest moment of Fernanda Montengro's cinema career, once she was a nominee for Best Actress. The Oscar was not given to her, but the actress got the Berlin prize. In 1999 she had another great achievement on TV, \"O Auto da Compadecida\", later cut to a film format and released in the movie theaters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk0ODA3ODk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTMwMDg1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005244","name":"Fernanda Montenegro","nicknames":["Fernandona"],"idIMDB":"nm0005244"},"actorId":"nm0005244","character":"Isadora","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0234551","main":true},{"actorName":"Marília Pêra","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702479","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NDQ2NDk3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODc4MDEz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 January 1943","placeOfBirth":" Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","birthName":"Marília Soares Pêra","bio":"Marília Pêra was born on January 22, 1943 in Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil as Marília Soares Pêra.
