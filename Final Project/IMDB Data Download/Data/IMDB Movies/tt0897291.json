Her impressive career includes a co-starring role on an award-winning television show, which is now strong in syndication, and a variety of memorable roles in hit feature films. She also toured America and the U.K. fronting a rather extreme rock band called \"Fydolla Ho\". Smith was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina, to Patricia Ann (Smoak), an oncology nurse, and James H. \"Jim\" Smith, a financial planner and U.S. Air Force pilot. Shawnee's achievements began early in her career when she appeared in the movie Annie (1982). As a young actress, she was awarded the Youth in Film Award for Best Actress in a television film for her role in the CBS drama Crime of Innocence (1985). She was honored with the Dramalogue Critics Award for her performance in the theatrical production \"To Gillian on her 37th Birthday\". In the same year, she received rave reviews for her co-starring role with Richard Dreyfuss at the Huntington Hartford Theatre in \"The Hands of its Enemy\". Shawnee then starred in The Blob (1988) for Columbia Pictures, in the hit comedy Summer School (1987) for Paramount Pictures and in Who's Harry Crumb? (1989), also for Columbia Pictures. Those roles would be followed by appearances in such highly-acclaimed films as Leaving Las Vegas (1995), Armageddon (1998), Desperate Hours (1990) and Breakfast of Champions (1999). Shawnee's television credits are equally as impressive, with a list that includes a regular role on the hit CBS comedy Becker (1998) as well as series regular roles on The Tom Show (1997) and Arsenio (1997). She appeared in the CBS television movies Something Borrowed, Something Blue (1997), I Saw What You Did (1988) and Face of Evil (1996), as well as the miniseries The Stand (1994) and The Shining (1997). Her recent film projects include The Almost Guys (2004), Saw (2004), a gritty, taut and terrifying film and the sequel Saw II (2005). Satisfied with pushing the extremes in her critically-acclaimed punk/metal band \"Fydolla Ho\", Shawnee is working on her first solo record with Queens of the Stone Age producer Chris Goss.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzQ5Mzg2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTE3Nzg0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0809938","name":"Shawnee Smith","idIMDB":"nm0809938"},"actorId":"nm0809938","character":"Lisa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Woods","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940712","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MjYyNjk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc5NDA3Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 July 1957","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","bio":"Michael Woods was born in Detroit, Michigan to Dr. Joseph and Dorothy Woods.
