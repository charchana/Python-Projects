Her family used to be fairly well-off, because her father was a soap merchant who supplied to major hotels in Hong Kong, and the family employed a number of servants at home. However, they lost everything during World War II. Hence she lives simply, and believes that money should be spent wisely and effectively. Despite her age (73 in 2009), she spends a lot of time doing volunteer work, e.g. helping at old people's homes. She has a big sister, six nephews and nieces, and a number of grand-nephews and nieces. During festivals, she has gatherings at her sister's home.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQyZmFkYjQtYzJhOC00NDY5LWIzZTgtMmY1OTY3NmU1OTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MTI5NzQ@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492352","name":"Lan Law","idIMDB":"nm0492352"},"actorId":"nm0492352","character":"May's Mum","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wai-Si Lee","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5624366","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Wai-Si Lee is an actress, known for Wan choi tung ji (1994), Bomb Disposal Officer: Baby Bomb (1994) and Wei, wen bian wei?
