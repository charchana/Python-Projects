Crudup was born in 1968 in Manhasset, New York (a Long Island suburb), the middle child in a family of three boys. He is the son of Georgann (Gaither) and Thomas Henry Crudup III, and the grandson of prominent attorney William Cotter \"Billy\" Gaither, Jr. Crudup was raised in Florida and Texas. His family frequently moved and always being the new kid meant Billy had to develop some way of gaining acceptance. Being the class clown was his ticket in. He found roles in school pageants and developed funny impersonations to entertain family and friends. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina (where he confirmed his interest in acting). Upon graduation, Crudup headed to NYC to live with his brother Tommy (who was at that time a publicist) and study at New York University, where he joined a theatre troupe called \"the lab!\" and did little plays and musicals - he even played \"Schroeder\" in the famed children's musical \"You're A Good Man Charlie Brown!\". He then went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts from the Tisch School of the Arts at NY in 1994. A year later, he'd already made a name for himself on Broadway, earning the Outer Critics Circle Outstanding Newcomer Award for his performance in Tom Stoppard's \"Arcadia\". Crudup's first big-screen acting gig was in the indie film Grind (1997), which was shot in 1994, but ended up on the shelf for three years. In 1996, he landed another, more lucrative role, opposite Hollywood hotshots Brad Pitt and Jason Patric in the Barry Levinson drama, Sleepers (1996). He followed that up with a brief appearance in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and a higher-profile turn as the rakish older brother in Inventing the Abbotts (1997). A self-described student of human nature, Crudup has said that he looks for characters wrestling with their mistakes. Rumor has it that he declined an audition for the lead in Titanic (1997) in order to seek out more challenging projects--like the \"Steve Prefontaine\" biopic Without Limits (1998). \"Limits\" showcased Crudup's ability to completely transform himself for a role (a quality that would help him skirt stardom while continuing to land substantive parts). In 2000, with three major films in release, Crudup's already bustling movie career reached a fever pitch. He first hit the festival circuit in Keith Gordon's Waking the Dead (2000), the tale of an up-and-coming politician who is haunted by the death of his young wife. Next came the art-house favorite Jesus' Son (1999). Finally, he starred as the semi-fictional '70s rocker \"Russell Hammond\" in Cameron Crowe's much-lauded Almost Famous (2000). In 2002, his production of \"The Elephant Man\" on Broadway closed after 65 performances, due to low ticket sales. Crudup lives in New York and returns regularly to the stage - in fact, it was during the 1996 Broadway run of \"Bus Stop\" that he began his romance with longtime girlfriend, Mary-Louise Parker. That romance ended in 2004, when Crudup left the then-pregnant Parker for his Stage Beauty (2004) co-star, Claire Danes. He seems to prefer quiet anonymity to the pomp and circumstance of the movie star lifestyle, but his ever-growing popularity guarantees that he won't be able to avoid the spotlight altogether.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MzM5NzUzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEyMDY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001082","name":"Billy Crudup","idIMDB":"nm0001082"},"actorId":"nm0001082","character":"Tommy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009417","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert De Niro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNDU3MzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc0MTIxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 August 1943","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Robert Anthony De Niro Jr.","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Robert De Niro, thought of as one of the greatest actors of all time, was born in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City, to artists Virginia (Admiral) and Robert De Niro Sr. His paternal grandfather was of Italian descent, and his other ancestry is Irish, German, Dutch, English, and French.

While at university, his friend, the aspiring actor Jeff Perry, took Kinney to Chicago to see a production of \"Grease\" in which his best friend, Gary Sinise, was appearing. The like-minded trio of Sinise, Perry and Kinney opened their own Chicago theatrical troupe, the Steppenwolf Theater, in 1973 in the basement of a church in Highland Park. The company's metamorphosis into one of the country's great regional theatrical companies began in 1976, after Kinney and Perry joined it full-time after graduating from college. The theater has, since 1976, put on a full season of ensemble works. The founders of Steppenwolf supported the theater and themselves with odd jobs until he company began financially self-supporting in the early 1980s. Re-located in the old St. Nicholas Theater, Steppenwolf's productions began to attract a steady audience. Steppenwolf flourished artistically and financially in the '80s, and moved once again to its permanent home at 1650 N. Halsted Street in Chicago. At the height of the company's fame, Kinney and Sinise were Steppenwolf's artistic co-directors, winning numerous awards, and even transferring some productions, such as their monumental adaptation of John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\", to Broadway. In addition to Kinney and Sinise, the company included such first rate actors as John Malkovich, Joan Allen and John Mahoney. As an actor, Kinney was nominated for a Tony Award for his appearance as the \"Reverend Casey\" in \"Grapes\". Kinney made his movie debut in 1985, with a bit part in Seven Minutes in Heaven (1985), and has been much in demand as a supporting actor ever since. On television, he had a small but recurring role on Thirtysomething (1987) and appeared as a regular on the HBO prison drama Oz (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2NDcxODcwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0455767","name":"Terry Kinney","idIMDB":"nm0455767"},"actorId":"nm0455767","character":"Ferguson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0111680","main":true},{"actorName":"Bruno Kirby","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0456124","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NTQ4NTU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA2MDAxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 April 1949","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Bruno Giovanni Quidaciolu Jr.","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Native New Yorker and Italianate Bruno Kirby tended towards assertive, pushy, streetwise characters and was armed with a highly distinctive scratchy tenor voice that complemented his slim eyes and droopy puss and accentuated his deadpan comedic instincts on film and TV. The well-regarded character actor was born Bruno Giovanni Quidaciolu on April 28, 1949, in New York City, the son of Lucille (Garibaldi) and actor Bruce Kirby. He was raised in NY's Hell's Kitchen section. In the late 1960s he moved with his family to California. His career began to rev up in the early 1970s with a part in the TV pilot episode of M*A*S*H (1972) and roles in the films The Young Graduates (1971), The Harrad Experiment (1973), Cinderella Liberty (1973) and Superdad (1973). Most notable of all, however, was his featured part as Young Clemenza alongside Robert De Niro's young Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II (1974). Bruno also played Richard S. Castellano's son in the short-lived ethnic sitcom The Super (1972). Coincidentally, Castellano played older Clemenza in the original The Godfather (1972). On stage in the 1980s and 1990s, Bruno appeared in \"On the Money\" (1983) and \"Geniuses\" (1985) and later replaced Kevin Spacey on Broadway in \"Lost in Yonkers\" in 1991. In 1997 he showcased off-Broadway, playing writer Alan Zweibel in \"Bunny Bunny,\" Zweibel's tribute to comedienne Gilda Radner and their close 14-year friendship. Bruno's close association with director Rob Reiner and actor Billy Crystal arguably led to the apex of his film career. In the early 1980s he chummed around with both Reiner and Crystal on a softball team, along with writer/actor/director Christopher Guest. Bruno wound up playing Crystal's best buddy in two of Crystal's biggest box-office hits -- When Harry Met Sally... (1989) and City Slickers (1991). He also appeared in Reiner's cult hit This Is Spinal Tap (1984). Other important film roles for him included his humorless lieutenant in Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), the refined salesman named \"Mouse\" in Tin Men (1987) and Marlon Brando's nephew in The Freshman (1990), that more or less amusingly parodied the \"Godfather\" association. Bruno was equally effective in taut, heavier stories and supported such up-and-coming stars as Leonardo DiCaprio in the dark and downbeat The Basketball Diaries (1995) and Johnny Depp in the mob family-styled drama Donnie Brasco (1997). On TV he was a regular on It's Garry Shandling's Show. (1986), played dogged prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi in the miniseries Helter Skelter (2004), which was a reenactment of the Charles Manson family horror, and appeared on the more popular shows of the day, such as Entourage (2004). He was married for the first time to actress Lynn Sellers in 2004 at age 55. His brother John is a well-known acting coach. An occasional TV director to boot, Bruno was diagnosed with leukemia shortly before his death on August 14, 2006, after having completed his part in the film Played (2006) starring Gabriel Byrne.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NTQ4NTU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA2MDAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0456124","name":"Bruno Kirby","idIMDB":"nm0456124"},"actorId":"nm0456124","character":"Shakes' Father","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0139214","main":true},{"actorName":"Frank Medrano","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535084","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMzgzMzQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAwNDc5OA@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 May 1958","placeOfBirth":" Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Frank Medrano was born on May 20, 1958 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA.

He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\". Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992). But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in Twelve Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence. He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Peña. Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MjE2MTQ2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE5MDY0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093","name":"Brad Pitt","idIMDB":"nm0000093"},"actorId":"nm0000093","character":"Michael","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009414","main":true},{"actorName":"Brad Renfro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000605","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NDE3NDA1MDVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDE1NTg5MjE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 July 1982","placeOfBirth":" Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","birthName":"Brad Barron Renfro","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Brad Renfro was born on July 25, 1982 in Knoxville, Tennessee, to Angela Denise McCrory and Mark Renfro, a factory worker.

Renfro won The Hollywood Reporter's Young Star Award in 1995 and was nominated as one of People magazine's \"Top 30 Under 30,\" though addiction problems in his teens and early 20s led to several police arrests and hampered his career.
