In both these films he played something of a blathering redneck idiot, although there was a streak of pathos in both performances which made it impossible to dismiss his characters as just 'bad' people. In 'David Lynch''s Wild at Heart (1990) and Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder (1990), he put in performances which showed he was merely biding his time before his next great role came along. Well, as luck would have it, two great roles came along in two years. As Rub Squeers, Paul Newman's emotional work partner in Nobody's Fool (1994), he put in an excellent performance. However, this performance was nothing compared to the acting powerhouse which was Heavy (1995). In this tender indie film, also marking Liv Tyler's first proper film role, Vince practically carries the whole film, and does so with style. Watching him gradually lose grip of his life breaks your heart, and it is without doubt one of the most underrated performances of the 90s. Vince has not really had a film role to touch this since, but he has been in the cult hit crime show, Murder One: Diary of a Serial Killer (1997), as Clifford Banks. It was a rare opportunity for Vince to flex his acting muscles as a slightly different type of character. Vince undoubtedly has the ability to be a major star; he just needs to be given the opportunity.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NjAwNDE4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMzODQwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898546","name":"Pruitt Taylor Vince","idIMDB":"nm0898546"},"actorId":"nm0898546","character":"Ben Dexter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0022245","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Harney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0363669","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNjk1NjI1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkzMjMxNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Michael J.

He remembers at a very early age entertaining his family by imitating relatives and family friends. He graduated from the prestigious Howard University School of Business, earning a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. After college, he worked on Wall Street at an investment banking firm. He and several partners eventually started their own marketing business, promoting mainstream products to the trend-setting urban market. Owning and operating his own successful business freed up Laz's time to finally explore his passion for acting. Laz began taking classes in the evening to hone his craft and it didn't take him long to begin landing roles in commercials and videos. From D.C. to New York, Laz feels his upbringing not only taught him how to deal with the school of hard knocks, but also prepared him for his biggest goal, his acting career. He credits the move to NYC as his move into manhood and the city holds many great memories for him. Laz also credits his acting ability to these life experiences, as he is able to bring a little of what he knows or has dealt with into his characters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0OTI4MjA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA2NjQ5MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0022306","name":"Laz Alonso","idIMDB":"nm0022306"},"actorId":"nm0022306","character":"Det.
