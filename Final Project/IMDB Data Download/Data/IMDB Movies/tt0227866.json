On one side of the chair, two figures, each an exact counterpart of himself, appear. On the other side a third figure, also an exact counterpart of himself, appears. The figures then run up the wall, one of them balancing itself upon the head of the magician, and the others stand on their heads in the palms of his hands. The figures are then turned into flags, which the magician waves and throws aside as he makes his exit.","simplePlot":"An ancient tower, in which is seated the magician, occupies the centre of the stage.

Méliès was an especially prolific innovator in the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color. His films include A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films. Méliès died of cancer on 21 January 1938 at the age of 76. In 2016, a Méliès film long thought lost, A Wager Between Two Magicians, was discovered in a Czechoslovak film archive.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNzM5MzEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3NzMyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0617588","name":"Georges Méliès","idIMDB":"nm0617588"},"actorId":"nm0617588","character":"The magician","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0426405","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0227866","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227866","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 min"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["24.99 m"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.2","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"154","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0015284","name":"Star-Film"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 02:54:30"}}
