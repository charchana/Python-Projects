During her work in movies, she became one of Japan's most popular actresses of their cinema's \"Golden Age\", ranking with actresses Kumi Mizuno and Mie Hama. One of her first films was Akiko (1961), which was named after her. Interestingly, the movie title shares both her real and character names. Her career took off when she came to Toho Studios, appearing in a host of sci-fi films, including that of the sexy gangster moll in Dogora (1964) and the bewitching alien-possessed princess in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964). However, in the Western Cinema, she is probably best-known for her role as Bond girl \"Aki\" in the 007 epic, You Only Live Twice (1967), appearing alongside actor Sean Connery. When production of the 007 film began, Wakabayashi was originally chosen to play Bond girl \"Kissy Suzuki\" and her co-star, Mie Hama, is to play Bond girl \"Suki\". As Hama had a difficult time mastering the English language, the two actresses switched roles. In addition, Wakabayashi suggested her character name be Aki instead of Suki. In the late 1960s to early 1970s, Japan's movie industry experienced an economic slump, which resulted in severe budget cuts. During that time, Wakabayashi made a rather abrupt end to her acting career, and has never been seen on the big screen since. Whether or not the economic slump played a factor, Wakabayashi remains one of the most memorable actresses of Japan, especially to Toho Studios' sci-fi fandom.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2NjMyMzM3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc5ODAyNzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906686","name":"Akiko Wakabayashi","idIMDB":"nm0906686"},"actorId":"nm0906686","character":"Bai-Lan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mie Hama","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0357240","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyODM1NDg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQyMzk3NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 November 1943","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Mie Hama was born in Tokyo, Japan on November 20, 1943. She first started out working as a bus fare collector. While working, she was spotted by producer Tomoyuki Tanaka , and was soon employed at Toho Studios. She appeared in a bevy of drama and sci-fi films, including King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962), where she became the Giant Ape's \"Damsel in Distress.\" She is probably best known in Western Cinema as Bond girl Kissy Suzuki, starring alongside actor Sean Connery in the 007 film You Only Live Twice (1967). That same year, King Kong Escapes (1967) was released, thus, she portrayed the spellbinding \"Bond-girlish\" villainess Madamn Piranha. Her extended wardrobe and enchanted bed chambers contributed to the film's \"James Bond-ish\" atmosphere. In addition, Hama would sometimes be referred to as \"Funny Face,\" due to her appearances in Japan's \"Crazy Cats\" movies. She became one of the most popular actresses in Japan's \"Golden Age\" of Cinema, but has done little acting when Japan's cinema world experienced severe financial problems. However, she did return to appear in a few films in the 1970s and 1980s, and she is seen, most recently, working as an active environmentalist.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyODM1NDg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQyMzk3NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0357240","name":"Mie Hama","idIMDB":"nm0357240"},"actorId":"nm0357240","character":"Miichin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tadao Nakamaru","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0620092","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tadao Nakamaru is known for his work on Super Electronic Bioman (1984), The Sword of Doom (1966) and The Hidden Fortress (1958).

Tall (six feet) and skeletal of build, bony-faced and wild-haired (when not ensconced in a vast silver wig), Amamoto's persona inspired Woody Allen to dub him with an imitation Peter Lorre voice in What's Up Tiger Lily? (1966). He was better served by Paul Frees' menacing tones in King Kong Escapes (Kingukongu no gyakushu, 1967). But neither voice matches Amamoto's own, surprisingly deep and resonant for his scrawny, sunken-chested frame. It might have served him well had he pursued his original career choice: politics. He barely managed to dodge the draft into Japan's Pacific War, through acceptance to Tokyo University, his nation's most prestigious school. He studied law, for he wished to become a diplomat, but he soon grew disillusioned in his studies, his world view darkened by the mire into which his country was plunging through its disastrous war. A sympathetic older sister rescued him from his self-confessed nihilism by introducing him to friends in the entertainment field who encouraged Amamoto to become an actor. Through these connections, Amamoto landed a place in the highly regarded Hayuza group of stage actors, where in an early bit of what would become typecasting, he portrayed a knife-wielding madman in the play \"Dojinkai\". There he was spotted by director Keisuke Kinoshita, who observed \"THERE'S an interesting-looking guy\", and promptly cast him in a small but pivotal role in his classic Twenty-Four Eyes (1954). Amamoto later joined Toho Studios, where he was at first nothing more than a background player in the likes of Nippon Tanjo (1959). His parts grew steadily larger and more showy in the likes of Denso ningen (The Secret of the Telegian, 1960) and Yojinbo (1961). By the late 1960s he was equally recognized for samurai films like Sword of Doom and science fiction/fantasy projects like Kingukongu no gyakushu (1967). Though he could hardly be less similar to Peter Lorre, he is at least as big a cult figure in present-day Japan, lending his name and presence to any number of films, TV shows and animated productions. As well, he has cultivated a reputation as an eccentric TV talkshow presence. Always fascinated by the country of Spain, he has also played flamenco guitar on the stage, sometimes in collaboration with his friend and fellow actor Yoshio Tsuchiya. He has written several books about Spain, and spends as much time living there as he can.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0023862","name":"Hideyo Amamoto","idIMDB":"nm0023862"},"actorId":"nm0023862","character":"Numaguchi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tetsu Nakamura","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0620244","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1908","placeOfBirth":" Canada","birthName":"Satoshi Nakamura","bio":"Tetsu Nakamura was born on September 19, 1908 in Canada as Satoshi Nakamura.
