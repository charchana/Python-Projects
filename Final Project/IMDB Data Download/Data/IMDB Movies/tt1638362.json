Spitzer had a hard driving, take no prisoners approach to prosecuting criminals. When he focused his efforts on Wall Street, he came up against some very powerful men. The chink in his armor was an escort whom he met regularly. When the fact that he spent time with a prostitute became public the knives came out so to speak, and Spitzer found himself isolated, resigning the Governorship. At one point, Spitzer recounts the story of a friend who gave him a t-shirt with 'Hubris is Terminal' printed on the front. A fitting epitaph somehow for his political career.","simplePlot":"An in-depth look at the rise and fall of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, including interviews with the scandalized, former politician.","actors":[{"actorName":"Alex Gibney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0316795","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjM5NTI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE3MDA2MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 October 1953","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Philip Alexander Gibney","bio":"Alex Gibney was born on October 23, 1953 in New York City, New York, USA as Philip Alexander Gibney.
