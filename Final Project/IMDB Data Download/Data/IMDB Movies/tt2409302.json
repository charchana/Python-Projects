It appears after Yamato nadeshiko (2000) he has gained much attention in Japan, though his performance in _\"Pure\" (1996)_, in 1996, garnered good attention for his sensitive portrayal of the orphaned journalist Sawatari Toru. Tsutsumi trained for the stage with the theatre project Tokyo in the early '90s after leaving the JAC where he had met his mentors, 'Hiroyuki Ada' and Tamasaburô Bandô, through whom he drew much inspiration. At the JAC, he had started out with the intent of learning how to play action roles, of which we still see much of in his wonderful film roles for the actor/director SABU, but his destiny has since unfolded to deliver more of this talented, unassuming and sincere actor through his sensitive and detailed acting style. Tsutsumi struggled to find his path in his teens, skipping school before returning to complete his high school out of a sense duty and filial piety to his mother. At 18 he left to join the JAC Kyoto, and at 20, he finally arrived in Tokyo to join the JAC branch there. Life was difficult and he worked at other jobs but by 1990 he had joined the theatre project Tokyo, and there met David Leveaux, with whom he trained and honed his skills as an actor. The 1990s was a prolific decade in the theatre for him and aside from the TPT, he worked also with Hideki Noda - their latest collaboration was in June 2001 for the play sakura no mori. At present he is starring in Koi no chikara (2002). Tsutsumi works alongside his close and long time associate and friend Eri Fukatsu. In May, Tsutsumi will move on to his next work, a stage performance in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, which will be directed by the acclaimed Yukio Ninagawa . Later this year, his next film with Sabu, Drive (2002), will be released. in it, he plays a salaryman who is kidnapped by a bunch of bank robbers. Tsutsumi Shinichi is a classically trained actor who has brought his considerable talent to bear in his stage, drama and film roles, but more than all this is his sense of professionalism - his will to create, through being a part of the ensemble, the beauty of the work as a whole.

From an early age, he exhibited excellent motor skills and cat-like reflexes; putting these skills to use and excelling in martial arts such as Judo and boxing. Surprisingly, even with his stunning looks and charisma, Sakaguchi wasn't seeking a career in acting - it sought him. Working as a street fighter, he was chosen by a then unknown director, Ryuhei Kitamura. Kitamura was still accumulating funds and financial resources for his independent film, Versus, and not knowing any established actors, he chose Sakaguchi due to his natural fighting skills and physical prowess. Kitamura felt that Sakaguchi shouldn't have to go to waste fighting in the streets, so why not bring his skills to film instead? Sakaguchi pushed himself physically to the extreme for the film, breaking ribs, bruising and cutting himself, even losing a tooth! Instead of halting production, he had it glued back in! The film proved to be quite a gamble for both star and director, but it also pay off in ways that neither would have expected. Upon its release, Versus was a hit in its native Japan, even with the novice director, reluctant actor, and extremely low-budget. Once released over-seas, the film became a cult hit. Seemingly overnight, both Sakaguchi and Kitamura launched their careers and continued to work together in films such as the Azumi series, Alive, Aragami and Battlefield Baseball. While all film ventures were successful, Sakaguchi had yet to acquire the same success he did with Versus. 2005 would prove to be a bigger year, taking on more mainstream film roles in Shinobi: Heart Under Blade. Then there was Death Trance, with a role similar to that of Versus; it was also in Death Watch that Sakaguchi directed the action scenes. 2007, however, proved to be even busier, acting in both films and television. Sakaguchi has also taken to working behind the camera, writing and directing his first film, Sakigake!! Otako juku (Be a Man! Samurai School). With such a strong dedication to his craft, be it actor, writer, or director, Sakaguchi is unstoppable.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MTcyNDI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQyNDIwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1056120","name":"Tak Sakaguchi","idIMDB":"nm1056120"},"actorId":"nm1056120","character":"Sasaki","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tetsu Watanabe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913880","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1951","placeOfBirth":" Japan","bio":"Tetsu Watanabe was born in 1951 in Japan.
