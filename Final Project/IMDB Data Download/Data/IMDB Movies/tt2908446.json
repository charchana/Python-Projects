The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she's built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica. Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London's West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Créatures célestes (1994). The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics. Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film's star, Emma Thompson, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996). The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations. After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997), Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Hideous Kinky (1998) and Holy Smoke (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \"deprogramming\" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in Quills (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama The Reader (2008), playing a former concentration camp guard. For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015), she received her seventh Academy Award nomination. Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss. In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated, and divorced in October 2010. In 2012, Kate married Ned Rocknroll, with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODgzMzM2NTE0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyMTkyOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000701","name":"Kate Winslet","nicknames":["English Rose","Corset Kate"],"idIMDB":"nm0000701"},"actorId":"nm0000701","character":"Jeanine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0376119","main":true},{"actorName":"Jai Courtney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2541974","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNzE0OTg1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU1MDM0MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 March 1986","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Jai Stephen Courtney","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Born March 15, 1986 in Sydney, Australia, Courtney and his sister were raised in Sydney's leafy northwest suburbs, attending Galston Public School where their mother, Karen, was a teacher.

His father, George, a former police officer, named his daughter, Liberty and son, Justice after vowing to do so while a young soldier in Vietnam. \"My Dad said if he made it back home, he'd give us these names after his love for his country.\" During his childhood, Justice was anything but fond of his name. \"As a kid, you don't want to stick out. And when I was introduced to people, my name was (and still is) a conversation starter, which for me was a nightmare.\" Leak said. \"But as you get older, you realize that it's good to have something that makes you different from everyone else.\" Leak was a shy kid who \"could easily blend into the walls.\" His quiet nature, however, made him a keen observer of human behavior, a skill that has served him well. \"All my life's experiences -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- have been preparing me to do this thing (acting). That's why I'm so thankful that I wasn't a popular kid!\" His first stint in the spotlight came during his senior year at Jefferson Davis High School. He was chosen to lead the marching band, and recalls his experience as drum major as the \"best of both worlds in terms of performing and music.\" \"For the first time, I was in a leadership position,\" Leak said. \"I couldn't hide behind anybody else, and looking back, that was the beginning point for me coming out of my shell.\" After graduation, Leak attended college in Texas and later Auburn University. While there, he became involved in the drama department, mainly working behind the scenes. But that all changed when he helped a classmate with an audition. \"I told the director that I wasn't auditioning and was only helping,\" Leak said. \"Afterwards, he stepped up and said, 'Why aren't you auditioning? You would be great in one of the leads.'\" His first role was the lead in Arthur Miller's, \"The Crucible.\" During his senior year, he starred in every main stage play produced at Auburn and earned two Irene Ryan Award nominations. He was also named \"best actor\" by the university's faculty and students. After earning a degree in theatre arts, Leak moved to Atlanta and was signed to the agency, People Store. He began doing commercials for companies such as Verizon Wireless, and later, had small roles in TV shows and independent films. His agent felt he could do more and sent his resume to the casting directors for \"The Great Debaters,\" a career changing moment. As the buzz of The Great Debaters crossed the country, so did Justice, making his move from the east to the west coast; capitalizing on the momentum of this success. Once in Los Angeles, he was quickly signed by two leading agencies and booked back to back to back guest starring roles on three major network shows within a month's time - and the momentum shows no signs of slowing anytime soon. Leak plans to remain humble, no matter how successful he becomes. \"I want to be known as a good soul with a kind heart, and a great artist who had the chance to make a difference in this world for the better and succeeded.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0OTEzNDQyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk2MjU5NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1495175","name":"Justice Leak","idIMDB":"nm1495175"},"actorId":"nm1495175","character":"Amity Divergent Husband","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0515046","main":true},{"actorName":"Lyndsi LaRose","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4103537","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwOTA2OTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM0MTQ5ODE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Lyndsi LaRose is an actress, known for Insurgent (2015), Ant-Man (2015) and Run.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwOTA2OTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM0MTQ5ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4103537","name":"Lyndsi LaRose","idIMDB":"nm4103537"},"actorId":"nm4103537","character":"Amity Teacher","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlie Bodin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1835107","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDgzNjI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMTU2OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Charlie Bodin is an actor and composer, known for Transformers (2007), Insurgent (2015) and Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse (2012).

She is of half African-American (from her father's mother and her mother's father) and half Ashkenazi Jewish (from her father's father and her mother's mother) descent. Zoe's love and interest in acting developed from classes she began taking while in school. Wasting little time, Zoe started working on two films during her senior year in high school; No Reservations (2007), directed by Scott Hicks, where she worked alongside Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart, and The Brave One (2007), directed by Neil Jordan, starring Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard. In 2008, Zoe completed work on Assassination of a High School President (2008), alongside Bruce Willis. She worked with Susan Sarandon and Pierce Brosnan on The Greatest (2009), which debuted at Sundance. Zoe has just wrapped on the latest Joel Schumacher film, Twelve (2010), co-starring Kiefer Sutherland, 50 Cent, Chace Crawford and Emma Roberts, which will be released in 2010. She recently wrapped shooting in New York on her first lead roles in the films, Beware the Gonzo (2010), opposite Amy Sedaris, Campbell Scott and Ezra Miller, and Yelling to the Sky (2011), the story of \"Sweetness O'Hara\", who has a sometimes-absent father and a present but mentally unstable mother.

Currently starring as President Fitzgerald Grant in Shonda Rhimes' hit series \"Scandal,\" -- now in its fourth season -- Goldwyn has other projects in the works as well. He recently took on the controversial figure Warren Jeffs, starring in the Lifetime movie, \"Outlaw Prophet: Warren Jeffs.\" Produced by Neil Meron and Craig Zadan. He also co-created and executive produced a series \"The Divide\" for AMC Studios. Goldwyn directed the two hour pilot while partner Richard LaGravenese wrote the series. \"The Divide\" had its eight-episode debut in 2014 on WEtv. Previously while on hiatus from \"Scandal,\" Goldwyn filmed the highly feature \"Divergent\" based on the book by Veronica Roth. The Summit Entertainment film was #1 at the box office opening weekend. In addition to acting on the show, Goldwyn has directed episodes of \"Scandal\" in the second, third and fourth seasons of the series. Other television directing credits include prestigious programs such as \"Dexter,\" \"Justified,\" \"Law & Order,\" \"Damages,\" \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"The L Word,\" among others. Goldwyn made an auspicious feature directorial debut with \"A Walk on the Moon\" starring Diane Lane and Viggo Mortensen. The film premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and went on to receive universal praise from critics. Goldwyn first read Pamela Gray's script five years earlier and shepherded it through multiple drafts until Dustin Hoffman came on board as a producer and got the project financed. Coincidentally when Gray originally wrote the screenplay as her Master's Thesis at UCLA Film School, she won the prestigious Samuel Goldwyn Writing Award - an honor established by Goldwyn's paternal grandfather, the legendary film producer. Additional feature directing credits include \"The Last Kiss,\" based on Gabriele Muccino's \"L'Ultimo Bacio,\" for which Goldwyn received Best Director from the Boston Film Festival and the romantic comedy \"Someone Like You.\" His last effort, \"Conviction,\" earned Hilary Swank a SAG Award nomination, won Best Film at the Boston Film Festival and was awarded a Freedom of Expression honor from the National Board of Review. As an actor, Goldwyn first caught audiences' attention with his portrayal of the villain in the box office smash \"Ghost.\" He went on to appear in numerous other films including \"The Pelican Brief\" with Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington, \"Kiss The Girls,\" Oliver Stone's \"Nixon,\" \"The Substance of Fire,\" \"The Last Samurai\" opposite Tom Cruise and the recent remake of Wes Craven's classic \"The Last House on the Left.\" He is also familiar to children as the title voice in Disney's animated feature \"Tarzan.\" His other television acting credits include \"The Good Wife,\" \"Dexter,\" \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent,\" \"Without A Trace,\" \"The L Word,\" the HBO Mini-Series \"From The Earth To The Moon,\" \"Frasier,\" \"Murphy Brown\" and \"Designing Women,\" where he touchingly portrayed the first AIDS victim on a prime time series. Goldwyn began his acting career on the stage, spending seven seasons at the Williamstown Theater Festival. His New York theater credits include \"The Water's Edge\" at the 2nd Stage Theater, \"The Dying Gaul\" at the Vineyard Theater, \"Holiday\" at The Circle in the Square opposite Laura Linney, \"Spike Heels\" with Kevin Bacon at 2nd Stage, \"The Sum of Us\" at the Cherry Lane Theater, for which he earned an Obie Award and \"Digby\" at the Manhattan Theater Club. His most recent stage credit was starring in the revival of the hit musical \"Promises, Promises\" on Broadway. Through his philanthropic work, Goldwyn co-chairs the Artists' Committee for the Innocence Project, is an Ambassador for the humanitarian relief organization Americares and is a Trustee for the Second Stage Theater.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NTI3ODgwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM2NTE2NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001282","name":"Tony
