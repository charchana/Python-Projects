When Broadway proved not quite ready to be conquered yet, she took whatever jobs she could find, including one as an artist's model. In that capacity she heard that the Selwyn Organization, a major producer of Broadway plays, was looking for girls with no stage experience. Since she was more than qualified in that respect, she tried out for the job and before she knew it she was in the chorus line of \"Rock-a-Bye-Baby\" until the show closed three months later. She then got a job in another Selwyn production, \"A Very Good Young Man\", but that show closed not long after opening. It was at this time that a casting director for Goldwyn Pictures hit the Broadway scene looking for new faces. She tested for him and impressed him enough that he finally picked her out of a pool of more than 1000 young girls who tested for the opportunity to go to Hollywood. She made her first film in 1922 and stayed in the business until 1935, when she retired. She was married twice, first to director King Vidor from 1926-1931, then to director Harry d'Abbadie d'Arrast from 1940 to his death in 1968. She died in Santa Barbara, CA, in 1991.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDc5MjU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTYyNzY3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0090187","name":"Eleanor Boardman","nicknames":["The Eastman Kodak Girl"],"idIMDB":"nm0090187"},"actorId":"nm0090187","character":"Fernanda","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pat O'Malley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641776","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJmNjIyYzctNWI5NS00MTBmLWE2YzctZGVjMGUwN2U0YmVlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 September 1890","placeOfBirth":" Forest City, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Patrick H.

Pat O'Malley, who is the better remembered, silent dramatic film star Pat O'Malley had an enduring career that stands on its own. He was of solid Irish-American stock, born in Forest City, Pennsylvania, in 1890. A one-time railroad switchman, he also had circus experience by the time he discovered an interest in movie making. He began with the Kalem Studio in 1913 and appeared in a few Irish films before signing on with Thomas Edison's company in 1914. The following year, he married actress Lillian Wilkes, and three of their children, Eileen, Mary Katherine, and Sheila, would become actors as well. His brother Charles O'Malley was a sometime actor, appearing in westerns on occasion. His first identifiable film is The Alien (1913). He began freelancing in 1916 and from then on, appeared in scores of silents as both a rugged and romantic lead, some classic films being The Heart of Humanity (1918), My Wild Irish Rose (1922), and The Virginian (1923). He did not age well come sound pictures, and he was quickly relegated to supporting parts. He appeared in hundreds upon hundreds of bits (mostly unbilled) until 1956, when he retired. He died a decade later.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJmNjIyYzctNWI5NS00MTBmLWE2YzctZGVjMGUwN2U0YmVlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641776","name":"Pat O'Malley","idIMDB":"nm0641776"},"actorId":"nm0641776","character":"Pat O'Malley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0494115","main":true},{"actorName":"Harrison Ford","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001230","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgxMjc4NTM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM5NTM1MzE@._V1._CR108,134,536,717_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 March 1884","placeOfBirth":" Kansas City, Missouri, USA","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Silent screen leading man in films from 1915-1932.
