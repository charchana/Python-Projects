His parents, recent immigrants, struggled to make a living in the US forcing them to live on the \"wrong side of the tracks\". The movie theatre was the only affordable, safe outlet that the family was able to enjoy together. So they went every Sunday like clockwork. It was during this time that Enrique at a young age developed a passion for Cinema. After graduating high school Enrique knew where his heart lay. With no family or social connection to the film industry, he jumped in with both feet, taking acting and writing classes everywhere he could, eventually landing his first real acting gig on the Latin based TV-show PLACAS. Enrique has since appeared in many feature films such as BRUCE ALMIGHTY with Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH and GANGS OF THE DEAD. He's also had numerous guest star gigs on the hit TV shows CSI MIAMI, THE UNIT, DAYS OF OUR LIVES, LAS VEGAS, BOSTON LEGAL, THE SHIELD, MAD TV, THE MINDY PROJECT and many others. In 2004 he founded the production company Stonehenge Pictures and co-produced the movie SPLINTER with Edward James Olmos and Tom Sizemore. SPLINTER also marked Enrique's debut as a screenwriter. The script attracted a lot of attention because of the heartfelt portrayal of a ruthless, but broken gang member named Dreamer who is trying to come to terms with his brother's brutal death in a gang war. Unable to find a Latino actor who could pull such a multi-faceted role, Enrique decided to play Dreamer himself; he has since become one of the busiest young Latino actors in Southern California. He co-wrote and starred in two independent films that gained world-wide distribution and were screened at over twenty film festivals. The raving reviews for his portrayal of the dark drug lord Tiburon in HITTIN' THE BRICKS and his performance in the socially conscious character piece 25 TO LIFE of which he wrote as well only give a glimpse of his spectrum and abilities as an actor and writer.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1376938","name":"Enrique Almeida","idIMDB":"nm1376938"},"actorId":"nm1376938","character":"Biker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joel Bryant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1071164","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI5ZjY5MTMtMjA2Ni00ZTM0LWE5N2QtYTAyNWIwNjUwNjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Joel Bryant graduated from Pepperdine University with a BA in Theatre and has lived in LA ever since.

Enthused and excited, he pursued his career and enhanced his resume with roles in commercials, music videos, and feature films. Today, you can spot Aldo on popular t.v. shows acting in dramatic and comedic roles, such as Sons of Anarchy and Hard Times of RJ Berger - catering to a wide range of audience.
