Later she became the first female circus clown in France and the founder of the first circus school of the country. Not content to be a big top star, she was also a singer and a stage and movie actress. Of course these activities only came second to her burning passion - circus. Nevertheless she can be remembered on the silver screen for at least two roles, that of Mado Petits Pieds, the waitress in Louis Malle's imaginative illustration of Raymond Queneau's Zazie dans le métro (1960) and of Pierre Étaix's wife (which she was also in real life) in his funnily poetic Le grand amour (1969).
