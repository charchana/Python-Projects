In 1987, Glover partnered with Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon film and went on to star in three hugely successful Lethal Weapon sequels.

Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi's recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. She came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show as Moms Mabley. She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends were Ted Danson and Frank Langella. She was married three times and was once addicted to drugs. Goldberg first came to prominence with her starring role in The Color Purple (1985). She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies like Pie voleuse (1987), The Telephone (1988) and Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986). She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smash Ghost (1990). Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). She admitted to being a huge fan of the original Star Trek (1966) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". Goldberg received another smash hit role in Sister Act (1992). Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and it was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, including Made in America (1993) and Soapdish (1991). Goldberg followed up to her success with Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993), which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first. As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such as Eddie (1996) and The Associate (1996), and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such as The Deep End of the Ocean (1999) and How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998). Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies include Rat Race (2001) and the quietly received Kingdom Come (2001). Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, including The Pagemaster (1994) and Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990), as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (including Theodore Rex (1995)). Whoopi Goldberg is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had. Currently, Whoopi Goldberg is the center square in Hollywood Squares (1998) and frequently hosts the Academy Awards. She also is an author, with the book \"Book\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4ODgzNjQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzczNzc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155","name":"Whoopi Goldberg","nicknames":["Da Whoop","Shuttlehead"],"idIMDB":"nm0000155"},"actorId":"nm0000155","character":"Celie Johnson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012680","main":true},{"actorName":"Margaret Avery","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001923","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNzcwOTUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzM5Nzc4._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 January 1944","placeOfBirth":" Mangum, Oklahoma, USA","bio":"Slender, attractive actress Margaret Avery, spellbinding in her role of Shug in Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple (1985), is certainly no \"one-hit wonder\". Although filmgoers may be able to trace her back only to that once-in-a-lifetime part, Margaret has been a talented player on the large and small screens for well over three decades. Born on January 20, 1944, in Mangum, Oklahoma, this daughter of a Navy man was raised in San Diego, California, where she completed high school in the mid-60s. She demonstrated a certain passion for acting while in her teens but decided to pursue a more stable career in teaching. Graduating from San Francisco State University, she joined the Los Angeles public school system as a substitute teacher, but the \"acting bug\" continued to nibble away at her. Margaret auditioned for commercials on the sly and managed to also segued into stage work and singing jobs. Among her early 1970s L.A. plays were \"Revolution\", \"Sistuhs\" and 1973's \"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?\", the last for which she nabbed the Los Angeles Drama Critics Award. Margaret's sharp skills as an actress helped her to move into TV roles, appearing in such established 1970s and 1980s series as The New Dick Van Dyke Show (1971), Kojak (1973), Sanford and Son (1972), Kolchak: The Night Stalker (1974), The Rookies (1972), Baby, I'm Back (1977), Murder, She Wrote (1984), Miami Vice (1984), Spenser: For Hire (1985), a recurring part in Harry O (1973) and a regular role in the short-lived series A.E.S. Hudson Street (1977). An entrancing, high-cheek-boned beauty, Margaret's film career ignited during the popular \"blaxploitation\" era. She somehow managed to avoid the pitfalls of many a black actress of that time, however, despite her sexy and revealing roles in her first two films, Cool Breeze (1972) starring Thalmus Rasulala and Lincoln Kilpatrick, and Hell Up in Harlem (1973), in which she found herself in the clutches of brawny former footballer Fred Williamson. Margaret carried on with Magnum Force (1973) (as a hooker) and the comedies Which Way Is Up? (1977) and The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh (1979), thereby establishing herself as a solid, reliable actress. Music was never far away from Margaret as attest to her strong roles in Louis Armstrong - Chicago Style (1976), starring Ben Vereen as \"Satchmo\", and Scott Joplin (1977), which showcased Billy Dee Williams as the ragtime great opposite her Belle Joplin. However, it was her riveting supporting turn as the drug-riddled, fly-by-night singer Shug Avery in The Color Purple (1985) that truly put Margaret on the map. Stories have long circulated that Spielberg wanted a star singer in the role and that Margaret received the role only after both Patti LaBelle and Tina Turner were approached and turned it down. Fortunately for Margaret (and filmgoers), she had previously worked with Spielberg in her first TV movie Something Evil (1972). He remembered her from this and cast her. Receiving an Academy Award nomination for \"Best Supporting Actress,\" it was expected that her career would hit major cinematic heights. Unfortunately, Margaret didn't make another film for three years, when she played a jazz singer in the little-seen Blueberry Hill (1988) with Carrie Snodgress. Since then Margaret has been productive but has flown well under the radar of mainstream Hollywood since her \"Color Purple\" heyday. On TV she continued to grace episodes of Amen (1986), The Cosby Show (1984), Roc (1991), \"MacGyver\" (1986)_, _\"JAG\" (1989)_ and Bones (2005), enhanced such commendable made-for-TV movies as Heat Wave (1990) with Cicely Tyson and James Earl Jones, and has been seen sporadically in films. She co-starred in The Return of Superfly (1990)--a nod to her old blaxploitation days--Lightning in a Bottle (1993), White Man (1995) with John Travolta, the Mario Van Peebles feature Love Kills (1998), Waitin' to Live (2006), directed by Travolta's brother Joey Travolta and has completed roles in Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins (2008) and Meet the Browns (2008) with Martin Lawrence and 'Angela Bassett', respectively. Divorced from director 'Robert Gordon Hunt', Margaret has one daughter, Aisha. In retrospect, one cannot help feel that this extremely capable and captivating actress has been shortchanged by Hollywood, but the sun has not set as of yet on the career of this remarkable lady. Margaret currently Co-Stars alongside Gabrielle Union and Richard Roundtree on BET's #1 Hit Drama 'Being Mary Jane' as Matriarch and Lupus Victim Helen Patterson. One is anxiously awaiting another film role for Margaret Avery on the level of \"Color Purple.\" It's certainly long overdue.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNzcwOTUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzM5Nzc4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001923","name":"Margaret Avery","idIMDB":"nm0001923"},"actorId":"nm0001923","character":"Shug Avery","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012684","main":true},{"actorName":"Oprah Winfrey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001856","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzODE3MzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEyNjc4._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 January 1954","placeOfBirth":" Kosciusko, Mississippi, USA","birthName":"Orpah Gail Winfrey","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Oprah Winfrey was born Orpah Gail Winfrey in Kosciusko, Mississippi, to Vernita Lee, a former maid, and Vernon Winfrey, a coal miner, barber, and city councilman.
