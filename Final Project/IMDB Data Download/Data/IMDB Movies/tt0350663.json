This allowed him to explore the world of acting while adventuring into self-expression with the aid of his post-punk band mates. Gratefully sometime later, he was honored with The Yves Montand Best Actor Award, at the 1998 Kiev International Film Festival for his searing performance in the truly indie film \"Burnt Eden\". Subsequently he was nominated for Best Lead Actor in a Dramatic Role at the following events: The 1999 Gemini Awards and the 2000 Gala Metro Star Awards, both for the critically and highly acclaimed TV Series \"Omerta\". In which he also performed speaking in four different languages. Further nominations included the 2006 ACTRA Award in a supporting role for \"Baby For Sale\" and the 2007 Minesota SMMASH Film Festival's Best Male Actor category for \"The Overlookers\". Romano's theatre training began in Montreal at a workshop with Joe Dowling, long standing Artistic Director of the Guthrie and formerly of the Abbey Theatre. Upon completion he moved to New York City to further his studies. In the process he became a bike messenger, construction worker and a bartender. Thankfully for the rest of us, not all at the same time! He collectively dedicated five years of theatre training at The Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, intensive workshops with Ron Stetson in the Sanford Meisner Technique and a workshop with Group Theatre alumni Bobby Lewis. Including a three-year tenure at the Stella Adler Theatre Conservatory. His graduating year being under the guidance of the legendary teacher Stella Adler, and luminary teachers Alice Winston, Jimmy Tripp and Casey Keziah whom instilled the beauty of Shakespeare. This period immensely helped to fortify his blue collar approach, bridging it with the truths of acting. Apart from his work, he is also very passionate for cycling, Kyudo archery, his friends and family. Including his dogs.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwN2RiZWMtMTU2OC00YWU2LTg1NmEtZjgzZDY0M2FlNWZmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjkzMTkzMjQ@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0651451","name":"Romano Orzari","nicknames":["Mano","Romi"],"idIMDB":"nm0651451"},"actorId":"nm0651451","character":"Garcia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephanie Moore","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601890","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNjYzNzI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMwNDE1MDI@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 July 1970","placeOfBirth":" Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","bio":"Stephanie Moore was born on July 14, 1970 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.
