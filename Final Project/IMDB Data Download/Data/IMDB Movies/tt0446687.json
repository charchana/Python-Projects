His brother James was born when Rupert was a year old, Georgina and Samantha were born in 1993 and 1996 respectively, and last, but not least, Charlotte, who was born in 1999. Rupert grew up in Hertfordshire, the English county directly to the north of London, conveniently placed for commuting to Leavesden Film Studios. Before successfully auditioning for the Harry Potter films, Rupert attended Richard Hale Secondary School in Hertford: here he took an active interest in school plays, being cast as Rumplestilskin in the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. He was also a regular attendee at weekend drama classes at Top Hat Stage School, also in Hertford. Time at school was limited, as Rupert was needed on set for the Harry Potter films, where all of the child actors were tutored for four hours a day on set, to keep up with legal requirements. During the summer of 2004, he took his GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) exams and completed his formal education.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MDA3NjA1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDcyMDYzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342488","name":"Rupert Grint","idIMDB":"nm0342488"},"actorId":"nm0342488","character":"Ben","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0103246","main":true},{"actorName":"Fay Cohen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2474419","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Fay Cohen is an actress, known for Driving Lessons (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2474419","name":"Fay Cohen","idIMDB":"nm2474419"},"actorId":"nm2474419","character":"Old Lady 1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ruby Mortlock","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2806938","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ruby Mortlock is an actress, known for Driving Lessons (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2806938","name":"Ruby Mortlock","idIMDB":"nm2806938"},"actorId":"nm2806938","character":"Old Lady 2","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Wetherhead","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2352072","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Don Wetherhead is an actor, known for Driving Lessons (2006) and Hogfather (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2352072","name":"Don Wetherhead","idIMDB":"nm2352072"},"actorId":"nm2352072","character":"Old Man","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Laura Linney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001473","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMDc3Mzc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc5OTcyMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 February 1964","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Laura Leggett Linney","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Laura Leggett Linney was born in New York City on February 5, 1964, into a theatre family. Her father was prominent playwright Romulus Linney, whose own great-grandfather was a congressman from North Carolina. Her mother, Miriam Anderson (Leggett), is a nurse. Although she did not live in her father's house (her parents having divorced when she was an infant), Linney's world revolved, in part, around his profession from the earliest age. She graduated from Brown University in 1986 and studied acting at Juilliard and the Arts Theatre School in Moscow and, thereafter, embarked on a career on the Broadway stage receiving favorable notices for her work in such plays as \"Hedda Gabler\" and \"Six Degrees of Separation\". Linney's film career began in the early 1990s with small roles in Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and Dave (1993). She landed the role of Mary Anne Singleton in the PBS film adaptations of Armistead Maupin's \"Tales of the City\" series, playing her in Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City (1993), Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City (1998) and Chroniques de San Francisco (2001). Linney's first substantial big-screen role was as the ex-girlfriend of Richard Gere's character in Primal Fear (1996) and her superb performance brought her praise and a better selection of roles. Clint Eastwood chose Linney to play his daughter, another prominent role, in 1997's Absolute Power (1997), followed by another second billing in the following year's The Truman Show (1998). Always a strong performer, Linney truly came into her own after 2000, starting the decade auspiciously with her widely-praised, arguably flawless performance in You Can Count on Me (2000). She found herself nominated for an Academy Award for this, her first lead role, for which her salary had been $10,000. Linney won numerous critics' awards for her role as Sammy, a single mother whose life is complicated by a new boss and the arrival in town of her aimless brother. On the heels of this success came her marvelous turn as Bertha Dorset in The House of Mirth (2000), clearly the best performance in a film of strong performances. Since then, Linney has frequently been offered challenging dramatic roles, and always rises to the occasion, such as in Mystic River (2003), in which she worked again with Clint Eastwood, and Kinsey (2004), for which she received another Academy Award nomination.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMDc3Mzc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc5OTcyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001473","name":"Laura Linney","idIMDB":"nm0001473"},"actorId":"nm0001473","character":"Laura","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0470331","main":true},{"actorName":"Oliver Milburn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0586958","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4OTAxOTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgzODk0OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 February 1973","placeOfBirth":" Dorset, England, UK","bio":"Born in Dorset, England, Oliver went to school at the prestigious Eton College, and was member of a drama group called Double Edge Drama.

A bona fide talent, her infectious spirit and self-deprecating sense of humor eventually captured the hearts of international audiences. The small and slender actress with the prominent cheekbones has yet to give an uninteresting performance. She was born Julia Mary Walters on February 22, 1950 in Smethwick, West Midlands, England, the youngest of three children and only daughter of Mary Bridget (O'Brien), an Irish-born postal clerk from County Mayo, and Thomas Walters, an English-born builder, from Birmingham. Convent schooled in Birmingham, she expressed an early desire to act. Her iron-willed mother had other ideas, however, and geared her towards a nursing career. Dutifully applying at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, Julie eventually gave up nursing when the pull to be an actress proved too strong. Studying English and Drama at Manchester Polytechnic, she subsequently joined a theatre company in Liverpool and apprenticed as a stand-up comic. A one-time company member of the Vanload improv troupe, she made her London stage debut in the aptly-titled comedy \"Funny Peculiar\" in 1975, and went on to develop a successfully bawdy act on the cabaret circuit. While at Manchester, Julie befriended aspiring writer/comedienne Victoria Wood and the twosome appeared together in sketch comedy. A couple of their works, \"Talent\" and \"Nearly a Happy Ending,\" transferred to TV and were accompanied by rave reviews. Eventually they were handed their own TV series, Wood and Walters (1981). In 1980, Julie scored a huge solo success under the theatre lights when she made her London debut in Willy Russell's \"Educating Rita.\" For her superlative performance she won both the Variety Critic's and London Critic's Circle Awards as the young hairdresser who vows to up her station in life by enrolling in a university. She conquered film as well when Educating Rita (1983) transferred to the big screen opposite Michael Caine as her Henry Higgins-like college professor, collecting a Golden Globe Award and Oscar nomination. Reuniting with Victoria Wood in 1984, the pair continue to appear together frequently on TV, most recently with the award-winning series Dinnerladies (1998). On stage Julie has impressed in a variety of roles ranging from the contemporary (\"Fool for Love,\" \"Frankie and Johnny at the Clair de Lune\") to the classics (\"Macbeth,\" \"The Rose Tattoo\" and \"All My Sons\"), winning the Olivier Award for the last-mentioned play. Following her success as Rita, she immediately rolled out a sterling succession of film femmes including her seedy waitress-turned-successful brothel-owner in Personal Services (1987); the unsophisticated, small-town wife of Phil Collins in Buster (1988); a boozy, man-chasing mum in Killing Dad or How to Love Your Mother (1990); and Liza Minnelli's abrasive tap student in Stepping Out (1991). Playing a wide variety of ages, she also mustered up a very convincing role as the mother of Joe Orton in the critically-acclaimed Prick Up Your Ears (1987). She capped her career in films as the abrasively stern but encouraging dance teacher in Billy Elliot (2000) which earned her a second Oscar nod and a healthy helping of quirky character parts, including her charming, charity-driven widow who poses à la natural in Calendar Girls (2003), and the maternal witch-wife Molly Weasley in the J.K. Rowling \"Harry Potter\" series. For her work on film and TV, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts has honored Julie five times, including four awards in a row (2001-2004). Married to Grant Roffey since 1997 after a 12-year relationship, the couple tend to a 70-acre organic farm they bought in Sussex. They have one child. Julie was honored with an OBE for her services to drama in 1999. A biography was published in 2003 entitled \"Julie Walters: Seriously Funny.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NDA2NjE0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk2ODIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910278","name":"Julie Walters","idIMDB":"nm0910278"},"actorId":"nm0910278","character":"Evie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chandra Ruegg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0749154","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 September 1984","placeOfBirth":" Zurich, Switzerland","bio":"Chandra Ruegg was born on September 26, 1984 in Zurich, Switzerland.
