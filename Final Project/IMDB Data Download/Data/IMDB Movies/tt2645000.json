Sarno is one of the pioneering directors of the sex-exploitation or \"sexploitation\" film genre. Known for a distinctly economic style and an abiding interest in tense, psycho-sexual character development, Sarno has also come to be recognized as one of the true geniuses to emerge from the sexploitation form. He continued to direct under various pseudonyms in the hardcore-sex feature genre of the 1970s and 1980s, but is best remembered for such pre-pornographic classics as Sin in the Suburbs (1964), Moonlighting Wives (1966), The Bed and How to Make It! (1966) and Inga (1968). Along with Russ Meyer and Radley Metzger, Sarno is one of the few sex-exploitation auteurs to receive critical attention. In recent years his work has been the subject of retrospectives at the New York Underground Film Festival, the Torino Film Festival in Turin, Italy, and the Cinémathèque française in Paris.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0765430","name":"Joseph W.

With his weird counter-culture friends as his cast, he began making silent 8mm and 16mm films in the mid-'60s; he screened these in rented Baltimore church halls to underground audiences drawn by word of mouth and street leafleting campaigns. As his filmmaking grew more polished and his subject matter more shocking, his audiences grew bigger, and his write-ups in the Baltimore papers more outraged. By the early 1970s he was making features, which he managed to get shown in midnight screenings in art cinemas by sheer perseverance. Success came when Pink Flamingos (1972) - a deliberate exercise in ultra-bad taste - took off in 1973, helped no doubt by lead actor Divine's infamous dog-crap eating scene. Waters continued to make low-budget shocking movies with his Dreamland repertory company until Hollywood crossover success came with Hairspray (1988), and although his movies nowadays might now appear cleaned up and professional, they retain Waters' playfulness, and reflect his lifelong obsessions.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE5MTQ1MjkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU1ODIyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000691","name":"John Waters","nicknames":["Pope of Trash","Prince of Puke"],"idIMDB":"nm0000691"},"actorId":"nm0000691","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2505858","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2505858","name":"Giulia D'Agnolo Vallan","idIMDB":"nm2505858"},"actorId":"nm2505858","character":"Herself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Annie Sprinkle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0819810","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 July 1954","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Ellen Steinberg","bio":"Annie Sprinkle was born Ellen F. Steinberg on July 23, 1954, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A self-described \"nice Jewish girl\" whose parents were academics, she grew up in the greater Los Angeles area, and was a bashful girl well into her teens. Of her youth, Annie has said, \"I was not a sexual child. I was very shy and inhibited. It wasn't until I lost my virginity at the age of 17 that I even became interested in sex.\" However, once she surrendered her maidenhead, sex was her lifelong concern, becoming a means of expression, then an art form, and finally a venue for exploring spirituality, First, however, it was a living. The 1960s and early 1970s were times of rebellion, and rebel against her middle-class roots young Ellen did, becoming a prostitute. Her entry into adult entertainment came while she was employed as a cashier at a porn theater. Viewing the movie on the screen fueled her curiosity about what it must be like to be filmed while making love. Initially she worked a variety of behind-the-camera jobs before making her debut as a hardcore-sex actress in Teenage Cover Girls (1976). While the re-christened Annie Sprinkle was never a superstar in adult entertainment, she enjoys the distinction of being one of the few actresses to be denounced by name from the floor of the U.S. Senate. Annie Sprinkle had used hardcore films as a springboard for a much richer, sex-positive career as an author, a lecturer/sex educator and a performance artist. Ultimately, she appeared in approximately 200 porn loops, shorts and feature films. Her niche was the fetish genre catering to paraphillias. In the early 1980s Sprinkle--a feminist--began exerting more control over her projects in her evolution from porn performer to artist. Before setting out on the next phase of her creative life, Sprinkle wrote and directed her first hardcore feature, Deep Inside Annie Sprinkle (1981), which became the #2 top-grossing adult film of 1982. While it was not much different from mainstream porn in terms of style, audiences responded to Sprinkle's warm and playful persona. From the \"nice Jewish girl\" of her teens, she had evolved into the Jewish mother of porn. The openly bisexual Annie (she lives with her life-partner Elizabeth Stephens, a lecturer at UC Santa Cruz) describes herself as a \"Post-Porn Modernist\" and promotes her own conception of a pansexual, spiritual female sexuality. The maturation of Dr. Sprinkle (she received a PhD in human sexuality) as an artist and as a person led her to leave the porn industry to fulfill her artistic pursuits as a performance artist, filmmaker, and writer, creating art and cultural artifacts that promote healthy attitudes toward sexuality and women. Annie Sprinkle, the artist and sexual shaman, challenges the repressive trends that are omnipresent in American culture, which has brought her not only into conflict with the anti-sex, pro-censorship wing of the feminist movement )the likes of Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon) right-wing religious fringe. Jesse Helms, the famously reactionary senator who got his start delivering political commentary on a North Carolina TV station in the days of the Fariness in Broadcasting standard, denounced her live performance art piece in the Senate during the debate over the National Endowment for the Arts. Her performance piece, which had received federal funding, entails inviting audience members to view her cervix with a speculum and flashlight in order to \"demystify the female body.\" Helms denounced her performance piece as pornography, which is besides the point. For Annie Sprinkle, non-misogynistic pornography can be a sex-positive vehicle for banning shame and ignorance while promoting pleasure and feminism. She remains committed to spreading the good news of her pro-sex message, as joyously as possible, that sex should be liberating, fun, free of shame and repression, and infused with creativity, love and spirituality.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0819810","name":"Annie Sprinkle","idIMDB":"nm0819810"},"actorId":"nm0819810","character":"Herself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Raso","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0065638","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NjQyOTM5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEwNTYyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 April 1964","placeOfBirth":" Jersey City, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Michael Louis Raso","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Michael Raso was born on April 20, 1964 in Jersey City, New Jersey, USA as Michael Louis Raso.

Never having made a secret of his bisexuality, Gillis made his first all-gay porn film in 1997, a sado-masochistic video in which he did not actually perform sex acts, but rather issued orders to the other members of the cast.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2ODY2NDEyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIyNjg5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003501","name":"Jamie Gillis","idIMDB":"nm0003501"},"actorId":"nm0003501","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2645000","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2645000","business":{"budget":{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 40 min (100 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color","Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.78 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.6","metascore":"69","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Stockholm, Sweden"}],"rated":"UNRATED","awards":[{"award":"Cleveland International Film Festival 2014","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Nesnady and Schwartz Documentary Competition","categories":[{"category":"Best Documentary","names":[{"name":"Wiktor Ericsson","id":"nm1172024","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"410","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0575653","name":"Anagram"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["film history","sexploitation","director","interview","female sexuality","pornography","old age","aging","female nudity","cult director","grindhouse theater","grindhouse film","grindhouse","filmmaking","screenwriter","filmmaker","marriage","sexuality","nudity","psychotronic"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 06:03:22"}}
