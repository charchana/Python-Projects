He deludes himself into believing that his now twelve year cabbie job is temporary and that someday he will own his own limousine service. He even lies to his hospitalized mother that he already owns one, with a further lie that he tells her as such primarily to make her happy, rather than the truth which is that he won't do anything to achieve that dream.

Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious youngster who was born in 1962 in Syracuse, New York, was destined to be one of the highest paid and most sought after actors in screen history. Tom is the only son (among four children) of nomadic parents, Mary Lee (Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III, an electrical engineer. His parents were both from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has German, Irish, and English ancestry. Young Tom spent his boyhood eternally on the move, and by the time he was 14 he had attended 15 different schools in the U.S. and Canada. He finally settled in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, with his mother and her new husband. While in high school, he developed an interest in acting and abandoned his plans of becoming a priest, dropped out of school, and at age 18 headed for New York and a possible acting career. The next 15 years of his life are the stuff of legends. He made his film debut with a small part in Endless Love (1981) and from the outset exhibited an undeniable box office appeal to both male and female audiences. Though below average height and not particularly handsome in the traditional sense, within 5 years Tom Cruise was starring in some of the top grossing films of the 1980s including Top Gun (1986); The Color of Money (1986), Rain Man (1988) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). By the 1990s he was one of the highest paid actors in the world earning an average 15 million dollars a picture in such blockbuster hits as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Jerry Maguire (1996) for which he received an Academy Award Nomination for best actor. In 1990 he renounced his devout Catholic beliefs and embraced The Church Of Scientology claiming that Scientology teachings had cured him of the dyslexia that had plagued him all of his life. A kind and thoughtful man well known for his compassion and generosity, Tom Cruise is one of the best liked members of the movie community. He was married to actress Nicole Kidman until 2001. Thomas Cruise Mapother IV has indeed come a long way from the lonely wanderings of his youth.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MjM3NTU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTMyMjAyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129","name":"Tom Cruise","nicknames":["TC"],"idIMDB":"nm0000129"},"actorId":"nm0000129","character":"Vincent","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005183","main":true},{"actorName":"Jamie Foxx","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjY1NDg3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA2MTg0MzE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1967","placeOfBirth":" Terrell, Texas, USA","birthName":"Eric Marlon Bishop","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Jamie Foxx is an American actor, singer, and comedian. He won an Academy Award for Best Actor, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, for his work in the 2004 biographical film Ray (2004). The same year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the action film Collateral (2004). Other prominent acting roles include the title role in the film Django Unchained (2012), the super villain Electro in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), and William Stacks in the 2014 version of Annie (2014). Jamie Foxx was born Eric Marlon Bishop in Terrell, Texas, to Louise Annette Talley and Darrell Bishop, who worked as a stockbroker and had later changed his name to Shahid Abdula. His mother was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed, his maternal grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age seven months, adopted Jamie too. He has said that he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, \"Peep This\", and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, Any Given Sunday (1999). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in Roc (1991) and In Living Color (1990). Foxx had his own WB television show from 1996 to 2001, the sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show (1996), in which he played Jamie King Jr. Foxx is also a Grammy Award-winning musician, producing four albums which have charted highly on the US Billboard 200: Unpredictable (2005), which topped the chart, Intuition (2008), Best Night of My Life (2010), and Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses (2015). In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed Django Unchained. Foxx starred alongside his Ray co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in White House Down alongside Channing Tatum. The following year, Foxx appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in Annie, Sony's Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical. He has two children, including Corinne Foxx, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjY1NDg3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA2MTg0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004937","name":"Jamie Foxx","idIMDB":"nm0004937"},"actorId":"nm0004937","character":"Max","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005184","main":true},{"actorName":"Jada Pinkett Smith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000586","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTE1MjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzczNTkwNjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 September 1971","placeOfBirth":" Baltimore, Maryland, USA","birthName":"Jada Koren Pinkett","height":"5' (1.52 m)","bio":"Jada Koren Pinkett Smith was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Robsol Grant Pinkett, Jr., a contractor, and Adrienne Banfield-Jones, a nurse.

His father's ancestry is Italian, and his mother is of half French-Canadian and half Italian descent. Mark moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he lived out most of his teenage years. Following high school, Mark moved with his family to San Diego and soon migrated north, eventually settling in Los Angeles. He took classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory and subsequently co-founded the Orpheus Theatre Company, an Equity-Waiver establishment, where he worked in nearly every capacity. From acting, writing, directing and producing to running the lights and building sets while building his resume. Bartending for nearly nine years to make ends meet and ready to give it all up, a chance meeting and resulting collaboration with playwright/screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan changed everything. Ruffalo won NY success in Lonergan's play \"This Is Our Youth\", which led to the male lead in Lonergan's film You Can Count on Me (2000), playing the ne'er-do-well brother of Laura Linney. The performance drew rave reviews and invited comparisons to an early Marlon Brando. Notable roles in The Last Castle (2001), XX/XY (2002), and Windtalkers (2002) followed, although in 2002 Ruffalo was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor. Though the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery led to a period of partial facial paralysis, from which he fully recovered. In 2003, Ruffalo scored leading roles alongside two popular female stars, playing a police detective opposite Meg Ryan in In the Cut (2003) and the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow in the comedy View from the Top (2003). Though both films were high-profile box office disappointments, Ruffalo went on to four notable (if highly disparate) films in 2004 - We Don't Live Here Anymore (2004), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), 13 Going on 30 (2004), and Collateral (2004) - which solidified his ability to be both a popular leading man and an acclaimed ensemble player in either comedy or drama. After 2004, Ruffalo was consistently at work, with leads in popular Hollywood films and independent productions that continued to solidify him as one of film's most consistently strong actors: Just Like Heaven (2005), Les fous du roi (2006), Zodiac (2007), Reservation Road (2007), and The Brothers Bloom (2008). In 2010 Ruffalo achieved something of a breakthrough, by directing the indie film Sympathy for Delicious (2010), which won him the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and co-starring as the sperm-donor father to lesbian couple Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in The Kids Are All Right (2010). His role in the idiosyncratic domestic comedy/drama earned him Academy Award, Independent Spirit Award, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actor. High-profile roles in Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island (2010) and 'Kenneth Longeran''s long-delayed Margaret (2011) followed before Ruffalo's appearance as Dr. Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, in Joss Whedon's blockbuster The Avengers (2012). Garnering highly positive reviews for a role in which actors Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not find success in previous films made Ruffalo a box office star in addition to a critically-acclaimed actor. He is expected to reprise the role in the upcoming 2015 sequel, and reunited with former co-star Gywneth Paltrow in the sex-addiction comedy-drama Thanks for Sharing (2012); Ruffalo also will take the lead in Ryan Murphy's adaptation of Larry Kramer's AIDS-drama play The Normal Heart (2014). Ruffalo has been married to actress Sunrise Coigney since 2000; the couple have three children, a son and two daughters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MjMwNjAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyNDg1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0749263","name":"Mark Ruffalo","idIMDB":"nm0749263"},"actorId":"nm0749263","character":"Fanning","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005186","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Berg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000916","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzA5Mzk1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY2OTA2Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 March 1964","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Peter Winkler Berg","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Peter Berg is an American actor, director, writer, and producer.

Those around him were amazed at the positive yet radical change in Emilio and realized he had found his true passion in life. In between his time studying Emilio worked as a mechanical engineer. His first feature role was in the TV series Renegade (1992) with Lorenzo Lamas. He left his day job behind after he landed a role in the feature film Con Air (1997) co-starring Nicolas Cage. Emilio has appeared in countless commercials, television programs and feature films including Traffic (2000), The Cable Guy (1996), NYPD Blue (1993), Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), JAG (1995), and ER (1994).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwODc3MDM5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDE2MjAz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0729256","name":"Emilio Rivera","nicknames":["Lefty"],"idIMDB":"nm0729256"},"actorId":"nm0729256","character":"Paco","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0106517","main":true},{"actorName":"Jamie McBride","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1408628","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk5NTQ0NDQ5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM2NzU4MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 April 1969","placeOfBirth":" Venice, California, USA","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Jamie McBride was born on April 6, 1969 in Venice, California, USA.
