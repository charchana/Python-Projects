His father had Irish and English ancestry, and his mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Poland). Matthew initially took up acting at New York's upper-crust Walden School after being sidelined from his athletic pursuits (football and soccer) by a knee injury. His father got him his stage debut at age 17 in a workshop production of the play \"On Valentine's Day\". Matthew's career then accelerated with parts in two Neil Simon projects: the play \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" (1982-83) and the feature film Max Dugan Returns (1983). Broderick reprised the role of Eugene in \"Biloxi Blues\" (1988), the second installment of the Simon trilogy, for both the Broadway production and the film adaptation (Biloxi Blues (1988)). For the third and final installment of the trilogy, he was replaced by Jonathan Silverman. In 1983, the same year as Max Dugan Returns (1983), Broderick had his first big-screen success in the light comedy WarGames (1983). Since then he has had his fair share of hits and misses, with some of his better films including Project X (1987) also starring Helen Hunt, whom he subsequently dated; Addicted to Love (1997); and Inspector Gadget (1999). Other films he has appeared in which may be known but not so much respected include Out on a Limb (1992) with his Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) co-star Jeffrey Jones; The Night We Never Met (1993); The Road to Wellville (1994); and The Cable Guy (1996) with Jim Carrey, which got him an MTV \"Best Fight\" award nomination; and the MTV film Election (1999) with Reese Witherspoon. In 1985 he was involved in a controversial car crash while driving in Ireland with his then fiancée Jennifer Grey. The crash killed a woman and her daughter. Broderick paid a small fine to the family of the victims. He broke his leg in the accident, which happened just as Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), his biggest hit, was coming out in the US. The box office success (but critical flop) and special effects blockbuster Godzilla (1998) gave Broderick his first action role (should any \"Godzilla\" sequels be planned, he is under contract for two more). He has occasionally returned to the stage in New York, either in revivals of old musical warhorses such as \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\" or in revivals of old \"show people\"plays, such as \"Night Must Fall\". In 1996 Broderick attempted to wear three hats as co-producer/director/actor in Infinity (1996), working very closely with his mother, who also wrote the screenplay. It was not a critical or commercial success, and he has not directed or produced since. Since May 1997 he has been married to actress Sarah Jessica Parker. He was previously engaged to both Helen Hunt and dated Lili Taylor. In 1999 he donned a trenchcoat for the children's film Inspector Gadget (1999), alongside Rupert Everett as the evil villain Claw. In March 2001 Broderick returned to Broadway in the musical smash \"The Producers\" (based on the 1968 Mel Brooks film of the same name). He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, which he lost to his co-star, Nathan Lane.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NjA0MzM0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU5ODAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000111","name":"Matthew Broderick","idIMDB":"nm0000111"},"actorId":"nm0000111","character":"Adult Simba","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000504","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Taylor Thomas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001795","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQwNjc0MTYwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzE3NzQz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 September 1981","placeOfBirth":" Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Jonathan Taylor Weiss","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Jonathan Taylor Thomas was born Jonathan Taylor Weiss on September 8, 1981 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to Claudine (Gonsalves) and Stephen Weiss. He has an older brother, Joel, and has Pennsylvania Dutch (German) and Portuguese ancestry. Growing up, he liked the music group Boyz II Men, and his favorite TV shows were Roseanne (1988) and Grace Under Fire (1993), but he also liked watching CNN news, to keep up to date with current events. One thing that Jonathan does not like is meat. He has been a vegetarian since he was four years old, and he doesn't use products that are tested on animals because he believes that it is wrong to hurt them. When Jonathan was four years old, his family moved from Bethlehem to Sacramento, California. At the age of seven, Jonathan was working as a model for print advertisements in Sacramento, and over the next few years, he appeared in TV commercials for Kelloggs cereal, Mattel toys and for many other products. By this time, Jonathan was ready for bigger roles, and in 1989, he landed the part of Greg Brady's son Kevin in the TV special The Bradys (1990). In 1990, he landed his biggest role yet, as Randy Taylor on Home Improvement (1991). Jonathan's audition went well, but what really gave him an edge over the other boys was that the casting directors thought that he looked a lot like his TV dad-to-be, Tim Allen. In 1991, Jonathan's parents divorced. He lived with his mother and his brother. He began work in feature length movies, as the voice of young Simba in Disney's The Lion King (1994), and as Ben Archer in Man of the House (1995) opposite Chevy Chase. Among his other movies are Tom and Huck (1995), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Wild America (1997), and I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQwNjc0MTYwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzE3NzQz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001795","name":"Jonathan Taylor Thomas","nicknames":["JTT","Jon"],"idIMDB":"nm0001795"},"actorId":"nm0001795","character":"Young Simba","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000504","main":true},{"actorName":"James Earl Jones","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000469","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNTg1MzMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQyMDgyMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 January 1931","placeOfBirth":" Arkabutla, Mississippi, USA","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"James Earl Jones was born on January 17, 1931 in Arkabutla, Mississippi, USA.

He is the son of Barbara Anne Brereton (Sharpe) and Paul Dugan Irons, an accountant. Young Jeremy didn't prove very fond of figures. A typical islander, he used to go to mainland England only once a year. He wound up being grounded when his family settled down in Hertfordshire. At the age of 13 he enrolled in Sherborne School, Dorset, where he was happy as he could practise his favorite sport, horse-riding. Before becoming an actor, he had considered a veterinarian surgeon's career. He trained at the Bristol Old Vic School for two years, then joined Bristol Old Vic repertory company where he gained much experience working in everything from Shakespeare to contemporary dramas. He moved to London in 1971 and had a number of odd jobs before landing the role of \"John the Baptist\" in the hit musical \"Godspell\". He went on to a successful early career in the West End theatre and on TV, and debuted on-screen in Nijinsky (1980). In the early 80s, he gained international attention with his starring role in the Granada Television serial adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel Brideshead Revisited (1981), after which he was much in demand as a romantic leading man. He went on to a steady film career. In 1984, he debuted on Broadway opposite: Glenn Close in Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\" and, in the mid-80s, he appeared in three lead roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Once described as 'the thinking woman's pin up', he has made his name in thought provoking films such as David Cronenberg's Faux-semblants (1988), for which he won the New York Critics Best Actor Award. He gained a Golden Globe Award in addition to an Oscar for Best Actor in 1990 for his role as Claus von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune (1990) alongside Glenn Close. Among his many achievements, his role as Professor Higgins in Loewe-Lerner's famous musical \"My Fair Lady\" mustn't be forgotten. It was in London, back in 1987. He is married to actress Sinéad Cusack, with whom he appeared in Waterland (1992) and in the Royal Shakespeare Company plays. He appeared with his son Samuel Irons and his father-in-law Cyril Cusack in the film Roald Dahl's Danny the Champion of the World (1989).

Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi's recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. She came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show as Moms Mabley. She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends were Ted Danson and Frank Langella. She was married three times and was once addicted to drugs. Goldberg first came to prominence with her starring role in The Color Purple (1985). She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies like Pie voleuse (1987), The Telephone (1988) and Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986). She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smash Ghost (1990). Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). She admitted to being a huge fan of the original Star Trek (1966) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". Goldberg received another smash hit role in Sister Act (1992). Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and it was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, including Made in America (1993) and Soapdish (1991). Goldberg followed up to her success with Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993), which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first. As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such as Eddie (1996) and The Associate (1996), and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such as The Deep End of the Ocean (1999) and How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998). Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies include Rat Race (2001) and the quietly received Kingdom Come (2001). Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, including The Pagemaster (1994) and Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990), as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (including Theodore Rex (1995)). Whoopi Goldberg is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had.

His mother Kitty Haywood, a legendary studio singer, was a staple in his young life and encouraged his pursuit of singing as well as acting. In being surrounded by the some of the best entertainers to date, Jason learned some of the most intricate works of the industry and found himself even more intrigued and driven in his goal of stardom. Weaver got his break in acting as a kid named Ernie, in the movie, \"The Kid Who Loved Christmas\". By the age of 12, Jason had appeared in two other projects; \"The Long Walk Home\", a film by Whoopi Goldberg and \"Brewster's Place\", a television series produced by Oprah Winfrey. Having been successful in his previous three roles, it was imminent that this young man's career would be of legendary status. In 1992, Weaver landed the role of a lifetime. He was cast to play the young and most talented Michael Jackson in the small screen film, \"The Jackson's: An American Dream.\" This made for television movie garnered him raved reviews and proved to be a launching pad for other areas of his career. 1993 branded Weaver in one of the two most notable roles of his career. Playing alongside Brandy in the television series \"Thea\", Jason continued his acting success until the abrupt cancellation of the show later that year. Weaver landed a role in one of the top Disney film's in 1994. Jason was blessed with the opportunity to display his other talent; singing. He graced us with his passionate sound as the singing voice of Simba in the box office hit, \"The Lion King\". In 1997, he continued his on screen success as teenage sibling, Marcus Henderson, in the hit television series \"Smart Guy\". After a two year hiatus, Jason was back at it with a role in the civil rights movie, \"Freedom Song\", starring Danny Glover and Loretta Divine, to name a few. The turn of the millennium also brought about a huge turn in Weaver's career. In 2002, he enjoyed a highly successful role as Earnest in the mega hit movie \"Drumline\", opposite Nick Cannon. The movie was set in Jason's hometown of Atlanta. In 2004, Weaver followed the success of \"Drumline\" with a role in \"The Lady Killers\", starring Tom Hank. In 2006, Jason Weaver was back in Atlanta to shoot \"ATL\", starring T.I. The Chris Robinson film was set in a roller rink and depicted the life of a teenage male that deals with the everyday struggles of finance, school, and friendship, but finds solace in a female that he meets at the roller rink he frequents. Let it be known that TI's female costar is not as she appears. The movie was a huge box office success. In addition to Jason's enormous success as an actor, he sets his site on his other love, music. After releasing only one of his two albums with Motown in the early 90s, Weaver enjoyed short lived success from \"Love Ambition\". He has since refocused his energy and dedication to long hours in the studio in pursuit of his musical dreams. The 2004 hit, \"One Call Away\" by Chingy, featured a rejuvenated Weaver singing the hook. This single topped the Billboard 100 chart at #2 in the U.S and #26 in the UK. In late 2006, Jason worked with BG on his new album and did several collaborations with close friend and super producer/writer Roger \"Mista Raja\" Green on his album, \"Chip off the Ol' Block\", due to be released in mid 2007. With Weaver's long list of accomplishments in his star career, many power hitters in the entertainment industry suggest that this Hollywood story is only at its midpoint. Jason is set to release his second album, entitled, \"Declaration of Independance\", in early summer 2007.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NTY4NTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg2MjQzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915868","name":"Jason Weaver","nicknames":["J.
