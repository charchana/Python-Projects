Vincent Bagnall Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Vincent studied Drama at San Francisco State University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. He trained classically at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, England. Vincent began his theater career in Germany playing Tom in Tennessee Williams' 'The Glass Menagerie' and Jerry in Edward Albee's 'The Zoo Story.' He then moved to Massachusetts and performed in plays such as 'Lysistrata'; 'Hedda Gabler'; 'The Miss Firecracker Contest'; The Boor; and 'Henry IV,' directed by Austin Pendleton at the Williamstown Theater Festival. Venturing westward to California, he performed in 'Macbeth,' 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' and 'Measure For Measure' at Shakespeare & Company in San Francisco. His repertoire was further enriched as a member of the San Francisco Mime Troupe. After his stint in California, Vincent moved to New York where he played the lead male character opposite actress-playwright Pamela Sabaugh in the award-winning 'Woman in the Animal Kingdom' at the New York International Fringe Festival. Other New York credits include his portrayal of Malcolm in 'Macbeth'; Algernon in 'The Importance of Being Earnest'; Rosalind in the \"switched-gender\" casting of 'As You Like It'; and Butch in 'The Good Time Boys' at The Wings Theater. While working in New York, Vincent was cast in a national tour with Chamber Theater Productions of Boston playing Roderick in 'The Fall of the House of Usher, General Zaroff in 'The Most Dangerous Game' and Sam in 'The Ransom of Red Chief.' A talented voice-over artist, his extremely versatile voice has earned him numerous roles in feature animation such as 'MD Geist II,' 'Garzey's Wing' and 'Genocyber.' Vincent's extensive acting range landed him lead roles in Bernard and Doris, Tenderness, 'I, Traveller' and 'Fender Saves The World. TV appearances include 'Saturday Night Live,' and 'As The World Turns. In 2007, Vincent recorded a complete audio book of Treasure Island. From 2007 until 2010, Vincent Bagnall is working on a documentary about The Weimar Republic, which took place in Germany from 1918 until 1933.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NTc0MTY0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzY3MTEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1138831","name":"Vincent Bagnall","idIMDB":"nm1138831"},"actorId":"nm1138831","character":" Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Louis Atlas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6619250","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Louis Atlas is an actor, known for Genocyber (1994).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6619250","name":"Louis Atlas","idIMDB":"nm6619250"},"actorId":"nm6619250","character":" Ryu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Berberian","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6619256","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"David Berberian is an actor, known for Genocyber (1994).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6619256","name":"David Berberian","idIMDB":"nm6619256"},"actorId":"nm6619256","character":" Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Colin Bruce","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0115448","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Colin Bruce is an actor, known for The Secret Garden (1993), Chariots of Fire (1981) and Gotham (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0115448","name":"Colin Bruce","idIMDB":"nm0115448"},"actorId":"nm0115448","character":" Sakomizu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shigeru Chiba","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0157133","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 February 1954","placeOfBirth":" Kumamoto, Japan","birthName":"Masaharu Maeda","bio":"Shigeru Chiba was born on February 4, 1954 in Kumamoto, Japan as Masaharu Maeda.
