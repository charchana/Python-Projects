One year after his debut on television in 1993, Lee was cast in his first film, a feature by Bae Chang-ho. His breakthrough came in late 1998 in the award-winning film An Affair by E-J Yong. This was followed up by another success, City of the Rising Sun, for which he received a Best Actor award at the domestic Chungryong Awards ceremony. After starring in the Korean-Japanese coproduction Asako in Ruby Shoes, released in December 2000, Lee found considerable popular success in a melodrama titled Last Present, where he was cast opposite Lee Young-ae, and in the action/mystery/drama The Last Witness directed by Bae Chang-ho. He is also scheduled to appear in an international coproduction to be shot in Korea and directed by Chinese filmmaker Chen Kaige.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxNjA1MTIxODJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQzOTc1NDk@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0497631","name":"Jung-jae Lee","idIMDB":"nm0497631"},"actorId":"nm0497631","character":"Jin-su Lee","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jin-young Jang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0417532","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 June 1974","placeOfBirth":" Jeonju, South Korea","bio":"Jin-young Jang was born on June 14, 1974 in Jeonju, South Korea.
