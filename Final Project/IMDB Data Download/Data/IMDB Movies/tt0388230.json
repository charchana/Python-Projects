While other kids were playing sports, he was making movies. He also spent many years honing his craft as a screenwriter. Stevan's much heralded debut feature, Malevolence, was truly a remarkable achievement. Shot on a shoestring budget, with the actor's and crew all taking deferred payments, including himself, Stevan wrote, produced, directed, edited and even composed the score for Malevolence. When the film was completed, distributors estimated its production cost at 1.5 to 2 million. Discovering the budget was under $200,000 shocked many in the industry. Malevolence went on to win several Film Festivals, including best feature at the Long Island International Film Expo, and Best Feature at the NYC Horror Film Festival. It was awarded best screenplay at the 2004 internet choice awards, and was listed on numerous \"best horror film of the year\" lists. One of Anchor Bay Entertainment's highest selling DVD's in their history of 3500 titles. Stevan followed up that film with a 180 degree turn, writing and directing \"Brutal Massacre: a Comedy\", a mockumentary starring David Naughton and Brian O'Halloran. His latest feature, Bereavement, is a bold departure from the standard cliche ridden horror film, offering genuine scares and shocks. With stellar Performances from Genre Veterans like Michael Biehn(The Abyss, The Terminator, Aliens) and John Savage(Deer Hunter), to rising stars such as Alexandra Daddario (Texas Chainsaw 3D, Percy Jackson), and Peyton List (DIary of a Wimpy Kid 2, Jessie) and Brett Rickaby (The Crazies).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1496042","name":"Stevan Mena","idIMDB":"nm1496042"},"actorId":"nm1496042","character":"Officer at Roadblock","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jay Cohen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169477","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jay Cohen is an actor, known for Seabiscuit (2003) and Malevolence (2003).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169477","name":"Jay Cohen","idIMDB":"nm0169477"},"actorId":"nm0169477","character":"17-Year-Old Martin Bristol","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0151054","main":true},{"actorName":"David K.
