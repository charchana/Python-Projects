Born and bred in Munich, he joined Bayern Munich at the age of 14. In 1965, he debuted in the German Bundesliga and became famous in the role of the team's sweeper. The following years, he won four league championships and four European cups (1966 Cup Winners' Cup, 1972-74 Champions' Cup). During that period, Beckenbauer also joined Germany's national side and had 103 caps in total. He led the team to the historic victories at the 1972 European Championships and the 1974 World Cup. After personal and professional problems, he accepted a contract to play in the North American Soccer Leauge with Cosmos New York. The team won the US championships on three occasions, but Beckenbauer returned to Germany and retired in 1984 after playing a season with Hamburger SV. Some months later, he was appointed manager of the German national team and coached the team until its final victory at the World Cup in 1990. He became one of two men, winning the cup as player and coach. In the 1990s, he returned to Bayern Munich and coached the team for one season, but finally became the club's president. More recently, Beckenbauer has headed Germany's bid to host the FIFA World Cup 2006 and is now chairman of the organization committee. Although the tabloids have always been interested in his turbulent private life, Franz Beckenbauer is considered \"unassailable\" in the public's eye.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0065325","name":"Franz Beckenbauer","nicknames":["The Kaiser","Kaiser","Kaiser Franz"],"idIMDB":"nm0065325"},"actorId":"nm0065325","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Thomas Beheshti","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6903481","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Thomas Beheshti yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6903481","name":"Thomas Beheshti","idIMDB":"nm6903481"},"actorId":"nm6903481","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Georg Behlau","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6903478","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Georg Behlau yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6903478","name":"Georg Behlau","idIMDB":"nm6903478"},"actorId":"nm6903478","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Oliver Bierhoff","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1505654","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 May 1968","placeOfBirth":" Karlsruhe, Germany","height":"6' 3¼\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Oliver Bierhoff was born on May 1, 1968 in Karlsruhe, Germany.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1505654","name":"Oliver Bierhoff","idIMDB":"nm1505654"},"actorId":"nm1505654","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sepp Blatter","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1349808","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 March 1936","placeOfBirth":" Visp, Valais, Switzerland","birthName":"Joseph Blatter","height":"5' 3½\" (1.61 m)","bio":"Sepp Blatter was born on March 10, 1936 in Visp, Valais, Switzerland as Joseph Blatter.
