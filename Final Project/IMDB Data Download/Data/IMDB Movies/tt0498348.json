Recognizable to some as the square-jawed Gillette man, or from numerous designer campaigns including Ralph Lauren and Armani, Merrill began his professional career as a corporate and tax attorney upon graduating with a law degree from University of Florida where he also shined as a pitcher for the Gator baseball team. After a couple of years, his interest in law waned, which lead him to modeling and commercial work in New York and worldwide. His successful run culminated with his role as the hunky window-washing Diet Coke guy, which garnered him an honor for \"Best Actor in an Advertisement\" from the British National Television Awards. The accolades in England eventually drew Merrill to London where he studied Shakespeare at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Classically trained and eager to embark on an acting career, Merrill headed to Los Angeles where he landed a succession of television roles including Charmed (1998), Just Shoot Me! (1997), Grounded for Life (2001), and The Job (2001), which paired him with Elizabeth Hurley as his girlfriend. He also just wrapped a guest spot on the mid-season drama Century City (2004). Merrill most recently completed production on the dramatic film No Regrets (2004) with Janine Turner as his wife, and Brad Johnson and Kate Jackson co-starring. Additional feature credits include his debut in the drama Against All Evidence (2002), a comedic turn in Spanish Fly (2003), and the shorts Infamy (2004), and festival-circuit thriller short Ice Water with William Baldwin and Kimberly Williams-Paisley.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyODMwNzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0998549","name":"Robert Merrill","idIMDB":"nm0998549"},"actorId":"nm0998549","character":"Paramedic","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0129049","main":true},{"actorName":"Cyia Batten","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0061347","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwMzg0NjE0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI3OTg0MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 January 1972","placeOfBirth":" Locust Valley, New York, USA","birthName":"Cynthia Ashley Batten","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Cyia Batten was born on January 26, 1972 in Locust Valley, New York, USA as Cynthia Ashley Batten.
