Being part of a military family meant not staying in one place for very long. Over the course of his childhood, Dennis attended two elementary schools two junior high schools and two different high schools. During his college years, Dennis majored in Accounting while minoring in Theatre. His love of acting was born out of his creative need to release his mind from his studies in accounting. Supporting himself as an Accounting Manager, Dennis moonlighted work in musical theatre. His luck improved when he landed a role in a commercial for Sullivan Bros Toyota which aired all across the southern region of Massachusetts. After that experience, Dennis knew he had to continue getting more work. He moved to Los Angeles to pursue his desire for professional acting. He made his screen debut in 2001 and has appeared across several video-productions, film shorts and documentaries. While not appearing on screen or stage, Dennis still utilizes his knowledge in accounting and has served as an accountant for several productions.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQzNzgwNjA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM1NjA2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1459300","name":"Dennis Luciani","idIMDB":"nm1459300"},"actorId":"nm1459300","character":"Lewis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1766238","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jonathan Williams is an actor, known for Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), Mirrors and Ghosts (2015) and Windstorm (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1766238","name":"Jonathan Williams","idIMDB":"nm1766238"},"actorId":"nm1766238","character":"Trent","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"George Gianozakos","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2942757","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"George Gianozakos is an actor, known for Windstorm (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2942757","name":"George Gianozakos","idIMDB":"nm2942757"},"actorId":"nm2942757","character":"Tim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Billy Kelly","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2942541","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Billy Kelly is an actor, known for Windstorm (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2942541","name":"Billy Kelly","idIMDB":"nm2942541"},"actorId":"nm2942541","character":"Henry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charles O'Hair","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641159","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MDM4OTMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxNTg1MDI@._V1_UY44_CR5,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Charles O'Hair is known for his work on Shamelove (2006), Asparagus (2007) and Across the Tracks (1990).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MDM4OTMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxNTg1MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641159","name":"Charles O'Hair","idIMDB":"nm0641159"},"actorId":"nm0641159","character":"Doctor Goodman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1000020","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1000020","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 17 min (77 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.8","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"26","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0205593","name":"VGK Productions"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:11:58"}}
