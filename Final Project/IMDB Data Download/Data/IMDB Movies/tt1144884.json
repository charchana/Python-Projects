He had long dreamed of becoming a Navy Seal, but all that changed in one afternoon at the cinema. Shortly after that, Zano and his family moved south to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he finished his high school education. Throughout his high school years, he was active in both the drama and TV production departments. In his junior year, Zano and his closest friends produced a weekly television program at Wellington High School. The wildly humorous and offbeat skit comedy show landed Zano in detention quite often, where he would kill time by writing a series of short films. Those shorts, which he starred in and helped to direct, made their way to the JVC Universal Film Competition semifinals 3 years in a row. Shortly after high school, he was offered a position with \"Prelude Pictures\" (Lost in Space (1998), Black Dog (1998)) in Television and Feature Film Development. During that time, he also acted as Associate Producer on the World AIDS Day TV special, Living Positive, hosted by Lou Diamond Phillips. In June 2001, Zano made the move to LA, where he began the daily grind of auditioning. His quick wit and charming sense of humor immediately made him a favorite among casting directors, who would call him in for reads even when the character description was totally opposite to his looks. Zano has a mental Rolodex overflowing with movie knowledge, which helped him land the hosting gig on MTV's Movie House (2002), which premiered on the cable channel in May 2002. After his move to LA, Zano remained close with his sisters and his Mom, who always supported and inspired him. Zano resides in Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NjMxOTc2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgzODIzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1214657","name":"Nick Zano","idIMDB":"nm1214657"},"actorId":"nm1214657","character":"Hunt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Haley Webb","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2251716","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNlNDVkNWYtYTUzZi00MTZhLWFmOGUtMTFjMTYxMWQwMmI0L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIyNjM4MA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 November 1985","placeOfBirth":" Woodbridge, Virginia, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Haley Webb has been working in film and television since she was 15.

Williamson","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Perhaps best remembered for his touching performance as \"Bubba\" opposite Tom Hanks in the Academy Award-winning Forrest Gump (1994), Mykelti Williamson is one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood, who has been steadily honing his craft since he first began acting professionally at the age of 18. This past fall Williamson starred as Lt. Philip Gerard, the hardnosed detective determined to recapture escaped convict Dr. Richard Kimble (Tim Daly) in CBS' update of the classic 1960's action series The Fugitive (2000). The son of an Air Force Staff Sergeant (father) and certified public accountant (mother), Williamson was born in St. Louis, MO, and began performing on the stage at the age of 9. Like many youngsters, he was enamored with the concept of television, and thought that the images he was seeing on the small screen were reality. It wasn't until his mother put him in a church play that he realized that what the people on the small screen were doing was performing. He was instantly hooked. At the age of 15, Williamson and his family settled in Los Angeles. A superb athlete, he excelled at both football and basketball, but the acting bug led him to quit sports and dance with the cheerleading squad, much to the chagrin of his coaches. Following graduation, Williamson began acting professionally, making appearances on television shows such as Starsky and Hutch (1975), Hill Street Blues (1981) and China Beach (1988), among others. He made his film debut in the Walter Hill-directed feature Streets of Fire (1984), opposite Diane Lane, Michael Paré and Willem Dafoe. He would subsequently appear in the feature The First Power (1990) with Lou Diamond Phillips, Miracle Mile (1988) with Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham, Number One with a Bullet (1987), Wildcats (1986) and Free Willy (1993). Following his critically acclaimed performance in Forrest Gump (1994), Williamson starred in Forest Whitaker's Waiting to Exhale (1995); partnered with Al Pacino in Michael Mann's Heat (1995); Sauvez Willy 2 (1995), and starred alongside Nicolas Cage in Con Air (1997). Williamson was also seen in Mike Nichols' political drama Primary Colors (1998) (a cameo appearance which he did as a personal favor to Nichols and John Travolta) and Three Kings (1999), opposite George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube. In 1996 Williamson returned to television when he starred opposite Delroy Lindo and Blair Underwood in the critically acclaimed HBO telefilm Soul of the Game (1996) and received rave reviews for his stirring portrayal of legendary Negro League baseball legend Josh Gibson. Williamson also starred in Buffalo Soldiers (1997) for TNT and 12 Angry Men (1997) for Showtime, as well as starring in the cable network's series The Hoop Life (1999). On stage Williamson starred with Samuel L. Jackson, D.B. Sweeney, Ellis Williams, Matt McGrath and Richard Reilly in Clark Gregg's (\"What Lies Beneath\") 1995's ensemble drama \"Distant Fires\", which earned the cast a prestigious L.A. Theatre Award. An avid sports fan and devoted family man, Williamson enjoys restoring classic cars and rodeoing in his free time. He currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two of his three daughters. Named by his grandfather for 'Spirit' or 'Silent Friend' in the language of Blackfeet Indians, Mykelti Williamson has quietly built a reputation in Hollywood as one of the most consistently proven actors in the business, delivering stirring and honest performances that always capture audiences.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MDY1NzU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYyNDUyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0932112","name":"Mykelti Williamson","idIMDB":"nm0932112"},"actorId":"nm0932112","character":"George","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Krista Allen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0020739","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM4OTc2ODEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTUwODEyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 April 1971","placeOfBirth":" Ventura, California, USA","birthName":"Krista J.
