Perhaps best known for work in farcical comedies, the tall, handsome actor has appeared in some of France's more outrageous films over the course of his prolific career. Born in Paris on November 24, 1952, Lhermitte began his career as one of the founding members of the comedy troupe Le Splendid. Among the troupe's other founders were Patrice Leconte, Josiane Balasko, and Michel Blanc, all of whom Lhermitte would collaborate with on future films. After his film debut in Bertrand Blier's Les Valseuses (1974) and a supporting role in Bertrand Tavernier's Que La Fête Commence... (1975), Lhermitte had his first screen collaboration with his Le Splendid colleagues, co-writing and acting in Leconte's Les Bronzés (1978). A farcical satire about a group of French tourists vacationing in Africa, the film proved to be phenomenally popular in France, inspiring a sequel the next year and a dedicated cult following. Lhermitte subsequently made his mark starring in a number of comedies, including Les Hommes Preferent les Grosses (1981) with Balasko, Jean-Loup Hubert's L'Année Prochaine...Si Tout Va Bien (1981) with Isabelle Adjani, and Blier's La Femme De Mon Pote (1983). He maintained a prolific work schedule throughout the '80s and '90s, continuing to play the romantic lead in comedies of every possible variety for a diverse array of directors. Lhermitte also continued to collaborate with his Le Splendid colleagues, starring in Leconte's 1993 Tango as a man intent on murdering his wife after she leaves him, and alongside Balasko in Grosse Fatigue, a comedy that featured Michel Blanc both directing and acting in a double role. In 1998, Lhermitte had one of his greatest successes to date as one of the stars of Francis Veber's Le Dîner de Cons. A witty comedy of manners, it featured the actor in top form as an arrogant publisher put in his place by the seemingly moronic man (Jacques Villeret) he has invited to his weekly dinner of idiots. One of the most popular films to be released in France in years, it was a phenomenal hit with critics and audiences alike. In addition to acting, Lhermitte has continued to work as a screenwriter and producer. In 1994, he wrote, produced, and starred in the children's comedy Un Indien dans la Ville; three years later he served as the associate producer for its American remake, Jungle 2 Jungle. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi Children: Victor Lhermitte, Louise Lhermitte, Astree Lhermitte-Soka Father: Andre Lhermitte","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTA0NzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ4MzAz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0508293","name":"Thierry Lhermitte","idIMDB":"nm0508293"},"actorId":"nm0508293","character":"Stephen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Timsit","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0863816","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 July 1959","placeOfBirth":" Alger, France","birthName":"Patrick Simon Timsit","bio":"Patrick Timsit was born on July 15, 1959 in Alger, France as Patrick Simon Timsit.

Her father was a gendarme, her mother was a sales-woman. Young Miou-Miou was selling strawberries helping out at her mother's fruit and vegetable stand at a street market. There she was spotted by actor-director Romain Bouteille, who invited her to work at Cafe de la Gare, a popular Parisian theatre, where Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere were principal actors. There she began as a cleaning lady, then became a dresser, then an actress. She was nicknamed Miou-Miou by Coluche because she was always nice, quiet, and clean as a kitty. In 1971, Miou-Miou made her film debut in La vie sentimentale de Georges le tueur (1971) (The Sentimental Life of George Le Tueur 1971). At that time she became romantically involved with the fellow actor Patrick Dewaere. Their daughter, named Angele, was born in 1974, but their relationship ended few years later, after their work in several films. Their relationship was portrayed in F comme Fairbanks (1976), and later was documented in _Patrick Dewaere (1992 documentary)_. Miou-Miou has been an unusual personality in the French cinema. She once refused to take the Cesar Award for Best Actress, which she won for the title role in Memoirs of a French Whore (1979). She explained that refusal citing her belief that artists should not compete against each other. Her career was hardly affected by such a gesture. She was nominated for Cesar nine times. Her better known works were made with Gérard Depardieu in Going Places (1974), This Sweet Sickness (1977), Ménage (1986), and Germinal (1993), an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Émile Zola.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MTQwNjQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk4ODgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591877","name":"Miou-Miou","idIMDB":"nm0591877"},"actorId":"nm0591877","character":"Patricia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Arielle Dombasle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0231319","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2ODk0NDA2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjQ0MTM1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 April 1953","placeOfBirth":" Hartford, Connecticut, USA","birthName":"Arielle Sonnery de Fromental","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Arielle Laure Maxime Sonnery, later known as Arielle Dombasle, was born to French parents in Hartford, Connecticut. After their mother's death in 1964, Dombasle and her brother were raised in Mexico by their maternal grandparents; she attended Lycée Franco-Mexicain, a private school. She decided to pursue a career in acting and singing after attending the Conservatoire International de Musique de Paris. Dombasle released five singles in the 1980s: \"Paris m'a séduit\" (1980), \"Cantate 78\" (1985), \"Je te salue mari\" (1986), \"Nada más\" (1988), and \"Amour symphonique\" (1989). She made her feature film debut in the French-language drama Perceval le Gallois (1978), and has gone on to appear in over 70 movies, most of which are French. Dombasle was nominated for a César Award for her supporting performance in the romantic drama L'ennui (1998), but lost to Dominique Blanc for Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train (1998). As well as acting, Dombasle has also directed and penned three films: Chassé-croisé (1982), Les pyramides bleues (1988), and Opium (2013).
