However, as the son of musicians, Marc acknowledges, \"Performing is in our blood.\" Of the four Singer children, oldest brother Claude is the only non-performer. The three boys were hell raisers, but Marc says sister Lori Singer held her own. \"She's an amazing girl and we're very close,\" he adds. Marc, who has fond memories of his childhood, was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, lived briefly in New York and grew up in Corpus Christi, TX, and in Oregon before going to college in the Midwest and Washington state. \"I've got a lot from each city which I've lived in,\" he observes. In Seattle, he met his future wife, Hawaiian-born actress Haunani Minn. They lived a California casual lifestyle, and Marc enjoys running, sailing, martial arts, boxing, skiing, and motorcycling in his spare time, as well as playing some Western classical piano every day. Marc's wife, Haunani Minn passed away on November 23, 2014 in Studio City, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNjUyNTg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc2MDM0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001743","name":"Marc Singer","nicknames":["Karen L.

Irene started her thespian career in Rome, and indeed thinks of that city as her most cherished home. Her acquaintance with Michelangelo Antonioni led to her first principal film role with director Aldo Lado and to her running with a fast crowd of European filmmakers. She received worldwide acclaim for her work in the smash Midnight Express (1978), for which she won the Golden Globe. Since then she has worked in numerous films, television shows and theater productions in the US and Europe, as well as working behind the camera with set design, costume design, development, writing, co-producing and producing. What's next? She's just acquired the rights to Jane Alison's magnificent novel \"The Love Artist\", has written the screen adaptation and plans to direct it. The story's hero is the great Roman poet Ovid, as seen through the eyes of a pagan priestess with whom he falls in love while adventuring along the Black Sea. Unfortunately for him, as we know from the story's opening, the Black Sea is where he will eventually be sent into exile for the remainder of his life. This film is a bird's-eye view of his tragic demise. Did his love for the exotic creature, Xenia, trigger the wrath of the moralistic Emperor Augustus? Or did his genius and desire for literary immorality blind him to the dangers of untrustworthy friends? This rich story, in crude movie terms, is a bit of Amadeus (1984) meets Dangerous Liaisons (1988) meets Shakespeare in Love (1998). The story's atmosphere even echoes Gladiator (2000), though in this case the arena is the human heart.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591968","name":"Irene Miracle","idIMDB":"nm0591968"},"actorId":"nm0591968","character":"Sarah Ferguson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mary Woronov","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001862","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4MzY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUxOTM2NA@@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 December 1943","placeOfBirth":" Palm Beach, Florida, USA","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Mary Woronov was born on December 8, 1943, at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Florida (some sources cite New York as her birthplace). She was raised by her mother, Carol (Eschholz), and her stepfather, Victor D. Woronov, a surgeon, who adopted her. She grew up in Brooklyn Heights and attended Cornell University as a sculpting major. After a class trip to Andy Warhol 's Silver Factory, she joined Warhol's entourage and starred in a number of his underground films and appeared as a go-go dancer in the Velvet Underground's Exploding Plastic Inevitable shows. She left the Factory in the late 1960s and, after recovering from a heavy methamphetamine addiction, spent two years in Europe with a friend; during this time, Warhol was shot by Valerie Solanas, and with the altered Factory dynamic, \"there was nothing to go back to.\" She supported herself with work in off-Broadway and off-off- Broadway theater, then \"got scared and got married\" to director/producer Theodore Gershuny. She appeared in three of his films, Kemek (1970), Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972), and Sugar Cookies (1973). After the marriage broke up, Woronov moved to Los Angeles at the invitation of friend Paul Bartel, where she appeared on the daytime soap Somerset (1970) and had a memorable role in Bartel's Death Race 2000 (1975). Her best and most famous role came in 1982, with the part of Mary Bland in Bartel's black comedy Eating Raoul (1982). A major cult figure as an actress, she is also an accomplished painter and writer, having published three books--Wake for the Angels: Paintings and Stories, the autobiography Swimming Underground: My Years in the Warhol Factory, and the novel Snake.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4MzY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUxOTM2NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001862","name":"Mary Woronov","nicknames":["Penny Arcade","Mary Might"],"idIMDB":"nm0001862"},"actorId":"nm0001862","character":"Dr. Glatman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tom Poster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692926","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tom Poster is known for his work on First Contact (1996), The Shadow Men (1997) and The Vivero Letter (1999).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692926","name":"Tom Poster","idIMDB":"nm0692926"},"actorId":"nm0692926","character":"Outsider","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Pugsley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0700130","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1OTY1OTM3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjcxNTUyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Don Pugsley was born in Des Moines, Iowa, USA.
