At the Almeida Theatre, her productions have included \"The Triumph of Love\" opposite Chiwetel Ejiofor and the radical verse production, \"Five Gold Rings\", opposite Damian Lewis. Helen has also worked extensively at the Donmar Warehouse playing lead roles in \"How I Learnt to Drive\", \"Old Times\" directed by Roger Michel, and in Sam Mendes' farewell double bill of \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Uncle Vanya\" (a triumph in both London and New York). For her performance in \"Twelfth Night\", Helen was nominated for the Evening Standard Best Actress Award, and the New York Drama Desk Awards. Helen also found time to found the production company \"The Public\" with Michael Sheen, producing new work at the Liverpool Everyman, The Ambassadors and the Donmar (in which she also starred). With over twenty productions under her belt, Mike Coveney recently wrote \"We celebrate the careers of great actors Olivier, Ashcroft, Richardson, Gielgud, Dench, the Redgraves, Gambon, Walter, Sher, Russell Beale and McCrory\". On the small screen, Helen's first television film, Karl Francis' Screen Two: Streetlife (1995) with Rhys Ifans, won her the Welsh BAFTA, Monte Carlo Best Actress Award and the Royal Television Society's Best Actress Award, for her extraordinary performance as \"Jo\".
