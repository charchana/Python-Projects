He is the son of Sadie Virginia (Arnett), a homemaker, and Delmar Lloyd Busey, a construction design manager. He has English, as well as Irish, Scottish, and German, ancestry. He graduated from Nathan Hale High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1962 and for a while was a professional musician. A talented drummer, he played in several bands, including those of country-and-western legends Leon Russell, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson. Busey's first film appearance was as a biker in the low-budget Angels Hard as They Come (1971) and, over the next few years, he landed several film roles generally as a country hick/redneck or surly, rebellious types. His real breakthrough came in the dynamic film The Buddy Holly Story (1978), with Busey taking the lead role as Buddy Holly, in addition to playing guitar and singing all the vocals! His stellar performance scored him a Best Actor nomination and the attention of Hollywood taking overcasting agents. Next up, he joined fellow young actors William Katt and Jan-Michael Vincent as surfing buddies growing up together in the cult surf film Big Wednesday (1978), directed by John Milius. However, a string of appearances in somewhat mediocre films took him out of the spotlight for several years, until he played the brutal assassin Mr. Joshua trying to kill Los Angeles cops Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the runaway mega-hit Lethal Weapon (1987). Further strong roles followed, including alongside Danny Glover once again in Predator 2 (1990). He was back on the beaches, this time tracking bank robbers with FBI agent Keanu Reeves, in Point Break - Extrême limite (1991) and nearly stole the show as a psychotic Navy officer in league with terrorists led by Tommy Lee Jones taking over the USS Missouri in the highly popular Piège en haute mer (1992). The entertaining Busey has continued to remain busy in front of the cameras and has certainly developed a minor cult following among many film fans. Plus, he's also the proud father of accomplished young actor Jake Busey, whose looks make him almost a dead ringer for his famous father.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjM5NjE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTk3MjUz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000997","name":"Gary Busey","nicknames":["Barry Goosey"],"idIMDB":"nm0000997"},"actorId":"nm0000997","character":" Tony O'Neil","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Johnny Delgado","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0216975","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 February 1948","placeOfBirth":" Manila, Philippines","birthName":"Juan Marasigan Feleo","bio":"Johnny Delgado was born on February 29, 1948 in Manila, Philippines as Juan Marasigan Feleo.

With his broad, mirthful grin, beady dark brown eyes, trim black goatee and mustache, swarthy complexion, thinning hair, protuberant sagging belly, and smooth, oily baritone voice, Diaz was a steady, scuzzy, often sinister and always charismatic presence in an alarmingly large volume of horror films and delectably down'n'dirty 70s drive-in features alike. He has been often described as the Filipino equivalent to Peter Lorre. Born in Manila in 1932, Diaz initially planned on being a lawyer (his father was Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal). After four years of practicing law Diaz became dissatisfied and decided to pursue an acting career instead. He started performing in amateur theater in 1949. In the late 50s he began his extremely lengthy and prolific film career, making his debut in the war picture \"Day of the Trumpet.\" Diaz soon amassed a huge number of credits, frequently appearing in movies for directors Eddie Romero and Cirio H. Santiago. Among his most noteworthy roles are a sneaky, ruthless diamond smuggler in Monte Hellman's \"Flight to Fury,\" a cunning and devious Satan in \"Beast of the Yellow Night,\" an amiable mechanic in Jack Starrett's terrific \"The Losers,\" a mute, whimpering, buck-toothed, hunch-backed village idiot in \"Night of the Cobra Woman,\" and a flamboyant homosexual prison guard in Jack Hill's hilarious chicks-in-chains send-up \"The Big Bird Cage\". Moreover, Diaz has also acted on stage in plays, portraying a broad range of parts that include Iago in Shakespeare's \"Othello\" and the King of Siam in \"The King and I.\" Alas, in 2001 he had to voluntarily quit acting because of old age and ill health. However, despite his retirement Vic Diaz's many delightful cinematic contributions shall continue to amuse and entertain B-movie fans for countless years to come.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225055","name":"Vic Diaz","idIMDB":"nm0225055"},"actorId":"nm0225055","character":" Maj.

Her grandmother is pre-World War II actress Rosita Rivera. She has two children by comedian Vic Sotto, who are now also interested in acting. She began her schooling in St. Theresa's College, Manila, but finished her elementary and secondary education at St. Agnes' Academy in Legaspi City, where she was very active in drama guilds. In 1980 she enrolled in Communication Arts at the Ateneo de Manila University and, later, the University of the Philippines. Introduced by young actor Alfie Anido to director 'Joey Gosiengfiao, she first appeared in teen dramas Under-age (1980) and Temptation Island (1980), but her launching movie was _Katorse (1984)_ with Anido and Gabby Concepcion. This film established her as one of the \"Regal Babies\" (named after the studio, Regal Films). She then appeared in a longer slew of teenage love or growing-pains dramas. Bakit ba ganyan (1981) was a film where she herself sang the theme song and popularized it thus. In 1985 she ventured into dramatic roles, starting with 'Mike de Leon''s Hindi nahahati ang langit (1985). Her other films are A Dangerous Life (1988), with American actor Gary Busey; Les insoumis (1989), Pangarap na ginto (1990), Huwag mong salingin ang sugat ko (1991) and Your Dream Is Mine (1992). In Ang babaeng nawawala sa sarili (1989), Bonnevie sizzled and wowed critics and audiences alike in the role of a possessed woman. She also portrayed real-life characters, such as in Eskapo (1995), as the wife of Geny Lopez; as one of the accused parents in the child-molestation drama, Minsan May Pangarap: The Guce Family Story (1995), shot in New York City; as the girlfriend of activist Leopoldo Mabilangan in Ka Hector (1994); and as Governor Chavit Singson's wife in Chavit (2003), opposite Cesar Montano. Other notable films where Bonnevie showed maturity as an actress of the highest calibre include: Tinik sa dibdib (1985), for which she won Best Supporting Actress at the Film Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) and Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP) awarding ceremonies; Magdusa ka! (1986), for which she was given Best Actress awards by FAMAS, FAP and Catholic Mass Media Awards; Gumapang ka sa lusak (1990), directed by Lino Brocka, for which she was nominated by FAMAS and URIAN Awards for Best Actress; and Sa kabila ng lahat (1991), for which she was nominated by FAMAS, FAP and Urian Awards for Best Actress. Other acting nominations are for Kung kasalanan man (1989), FAMAS; A Moment Too Long (1990), FAP; Tanging yaman (2000), which won Best Picture in nearly all the local awards ceremonies and gave her an URIAN Best Supporting Actress nomination; American Adobo (2001), URIAN Best Actress nomination; and Bridal Shower (2004), URIAN Best Actress nomination again. Bonnevie also appeared in bright comedies with her ex-husband, Vic Sotto, in Hindi pa tapos ang labada, darling (1994) and Bakit ba ganyan? (Ewan ko nga ba, Darling) (2000). When they were still married they also appeared together in Ride on Baby (1985) and Mama Said, Papa Said I Love You (1985). Bonnevie also topbilled Tatarin (2001), based on the short story \"Summer Solstice\" by Nick Joaquin; critics nearly panned the movie but appreciated Bonnevie's nuanced characterization of Lupe Moreta. A dramatic actress who chooses her roles wisely and a loving mother of two, Bonnevie is sorely missed from present-day Filipino movies. Except for her stints on soap operas and for judging a recent TV talent contest (and just recently, appearing unclothed as the cover of FHM Magazine), Bonnevie disappeared from the limelight during 2005 and 2006; she was in the United States for business purposes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYyMzU2YjAtMjczMi00ZWRiLTllOWYtMjhiN2YxMTM2OWU3L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI5NjIyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095007","name":"Dina Bonnevie","idIMDB":"nm0095007"},"actorId":"nm0095007","character":" Celie Balamo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dave Brodett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0110862","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Dave Brodett is an actor and writer, known for Wating (1994), Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection (1990) and Six Million Centavo Man (1980).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0110862","name":"Dave Brodett","idIMDB":"nm0110862"},"actorId":"nm0110862","character":" Galman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Leah Cabusi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0127931","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Leah Cabusi is an actress, known for A Dangerous Life (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0127931","name":"Leah Cabusi","idIMDB":"nm0127931"},"actorId":"nm0127931","character":" 'Kris' Aquino","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0101004","main":true},{"actorName":"Alexander Cortez","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181332","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Alexander Cortez was born in Far Rockaway Queens New York.
