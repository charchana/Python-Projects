Eventually these dance classes lead to acting and music classes. Paul's experience covers an eclectic range of roles in TV, films, commercials and theater. His film credits includes the just released, The Human Race, Rogue Pictures' Altered, Happiness, From the Head, Ambush at Dark Canyon, Showtime's Free, The Outside, and The Gundown. TV credits include Awake, Law & Order L.A., The Whole Truth, CSI Miami, The Shield, Crossing Jordan, Criminal Minds, Alias, Medium, and The West Wing.
