His maternal grandfather, Stanley Wemyss, was a cinematographer. Crowe's recent ancestry includes Welsh (where his paternal grandfather was born, in Wrexham), English, Irish, Scottish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Maori (one of Crowe's maternal great-grandmothers, Erana Putiputi Hayes Heihi, was Maori). Crowe's family moved to Australia when he was a small child, and Russell got the acting bug early in life. Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell's first big break came with two films ... the first, Romper Stomper (1992), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, The Sum of Us (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Romper Stomper (1992) and wanted him for her film, Mort ou vif (1995). But filming on The Sum of Us (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With Mort ou vif (1995) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. Virtuosity (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Virtuosity (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers. L.A. Confidential (1997), Russell's third American film, brought him the US fame and attention that his fans have felt he deserved all along. Missing the Oscar nod this time around, he didn't seem deterred and signed to do his first film with The Walt Disney Company, Mystery, Alaska (1999). He achieved even more success and awards for his performances in Gladiator (2000) and A Beautiful Mind (2001).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTExNTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg1NzkzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000128","name":"Russell Crowe","nicknames":["Rusty","Russ"],"idIMDB":"nm0000128"},"actorId":"nm0000128","character":"Maximus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002127","main":true},{"actorName":"Joaquin Phoenix","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAzNjg5MDE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIxNzU0OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 October 1974","placeOfBirth":" San Juan, Puerto Rico","birthName":"Joaquin Rafael Bottom","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Joaquin Rafael Phoenix was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Arlyn (Dunetz) and John Bottom, and is the middle child in a brood of five. His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family in New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe. The family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin's first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River's sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982). He worked with his brother again on the afterschool special ABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp SpaceCamp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Russkies (1987). In the late '80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River's film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn't sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Parenthood (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world. His parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman's obsessive devotee in To Die For (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics' darling in his own right. His follow-up turn in Inventing the Abbotts (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to future fiancée Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone's U Turn - Ici commence l'enfer (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Return to Paradise (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Clay Pigeons (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8 mm (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Gladiator (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe's swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role. Later that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade's asylum in Quills (2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musician Johnny Cash in the biography Walk the Line (2005). He also recorded an album, the film's soundtrack, for which he received the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAzNjg5MDE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIxNzU0OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618","name":"Joaquin Phoenix","nicknames":["Kitten","Joaq","Leaf"],"idIMDB":"nm0001618"},"actorId":"nm0001618","character":"Commodus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002128","main":true},{"actorName":"Connie Nielsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001567","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwOTQ5NTc3OTVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY4MDc1MDYx._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 July 1965","placeOfBirth":" Elling, Frederikshavn, Denmark","birthName":"Connie Inge-Lise Nielsen","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Danish beauty Connie Nielsen consistently lights up the screen with an eclectic bevy of film roles. She was born in Frederikshavn, Denmark, to a mother who worked as an insurance clerk, and a father, Bent Nielsen, who was a bus driver. Nielsen began her acting career working alongside her mother on the local revue and variety scene. At 18, she headed to Paris to continue her pursuit of acting, which led her to further work and study in Rome and Milan. In addition to being an accomplished actress, Nielsen is also a trained singer, dancer and is fluent in English, German, Danish, Swedish, French and Italian. She resides in New York. However, it was Nielsen's portrayal of \"Princess Lucilla\", opposite Russell Crowe's Maximus in Ridley Scott's Academy Award-winning Gladiator (2000), which first garnered a mass appeal. She won Best Actress Awards from the Danish Academy Awards and from the San Sebastian Film Festival for her role in the Danish drama Brothers (2004) (aka Brothers), which was released by Focus Features and IFC Films. She then appeared in the World War II epic The Great Raid (2005) opposite Benjamin Bratt, Joseph Fiennes and James Franco for director John Dahl and produced by Miramax; the dramatic thriller Return to Sender (2004) directed by Bille August, which premiered at The Toronto Film Festival in 2004; and the black comedy The Ice Harvest (2005) with John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton and Randy Quaid, directed by Harold Ramis for Focus Features. In 2003, Nielsen starred as an industrial spy in a corporate war in the critically acclaimed suspense thriller Demonlover (2002), directed by Olivier Assayas and co-starring Chloë Sevigny and Gina Gershon. Her other lead roles range from The Hunted (2003) by director William Friedkin (with Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro; to Basic (2003) by director John McTiernan (opposite John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson); to One Hour Photo (2002) where she starred opposite Robin Williams; to Mission to Mars (2000) opposite Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins and Don Cheadle; to The Devil's Advocate (1997) starring Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves. Additionally, Nielsen has received a Best Actress Award from the Empire Awards for her role in Gladiator (2000), and has given unforgettable performances as a German heroin junkie in Permanent Midnight (1998) opposite Ben Stiller and as an unmatronly Texas mother in Rushmore (1998) opposite Bill Murray. Other film credits include Innocents (2000) (aka The Innocents) opposite Jean-Hugues Anglade, Voyage (1993) with Rutger Hauer and Eric Roberts.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwOTQ5NTc3OTVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY4MDc1MDYx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001567","name":"Connie Nielsen","idIMDB":"nm0001567"},"actorId":"nm0001567","character":"Lucilla","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002129","main":true},{"actorName":"Oliver Reed","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001657","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NDg5MDg1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEwODkyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 February 1938","placeOfBirth":" Wimbledon, London, England, UK","birthName":"Robert Oliver Reed","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Oliver Reed was born on February 13, 1938 in Wimbledon, London, England as Robert Oliver Reed.

He was the son of Mildred Josephine (Harty) and Ivan John Harris, and was an excellent rugby player, with a strong passion for literature. Unfortunately, a bout of tuberculosis as a teenager ended his aspirations to a rugby career, but he became fascinated with the theater and skipped a local dance one night to attend a performance of \"Henry IV\". He was hooked and went on to learn his craft at The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, then spent several years in stage productions. He debuted on screen in L'épopée dans l'ombre (1959) and quickly scored regular work in films, including The Wreck of the Mary Deare (1959), The Night Fighters (1960) and a good role as a frustrated Australian bomber pilot in The Guns of Navarone (1961). However, his breakthrough performance was as the quintessential \"angry young man\" in the sensational drama This Sporting Life (1963), which scored him an Oscar nomination. He then appeared in the WW II commando tale The Heroes of Telemark (1965) and in the Sam Peckinpah-directed western Major Dundee (1965). He next showed up in Hawaii (1966) and played King Arthur in Camelot (1967), a lackluster adaptation of the famous Broadway play. Better performances followed, among them a role as a reluctant police informer in The Molly Maguires (1970) alongside Sir Sean Connery. Harris took the lead role in the violent western A Man Called Horse (1970), which became something of a cult film and spawned two sequels. As the 1970s progressed, Harris continued to appear regularly on screen; however, the quality of the scripts varied from above average to woeful. His credits during this period included directing himself as an aging soccer player in the delightful The Hero (1971); the western The Deadly Trackers (1973); the big-budget \"disaster\" film Juggernaut (1974); the strangely-titled crime film 99 and 44/100% Dead (1974); with Connery again in Robin and Marian (1976); Gulliver's Travels (1977); a part in the Jaws (1975) ripoff Orca (1977) and a nice turn as an ill-fated mercenary with Richard Burton and Roger Moore in the popular action film The Wild Geese (1978). The 1980s kicked off with Harris appearing in the silly Bo Derek vanity production Tarzan the Ape Man (1981) and the remainder of the decade had him appearing in some very forgettable productions. However, the luck of the Irish was once again to shine on Harris' career and he scored rave reviews (and another Oscar nomination) for The Field (1990). He then locked horns with Harrison Ford as an IRA sympathizer in Patriot Games (1992) and got one of his best roles as gunfighter English Bob in the Clint Eastwood western Unforgiven (1992). Harris was firmly back in vogue and rewarded his fans with more wonderful performances in Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993); Pleure ô pays bien-aimé (1995); The Great Kandinsky (1995) and This Is the Sea (1997). Further fortune came his way with a strong performance in the blockbuster Gladiator (2000) and he became known to an entirely new generation of film fans as Albus Dumbledore in the mega-successful Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002). His final screen role was as \"Lucius Sulla\" in Caesar (2002). A diverse, vigorous and captivating actor, Richard Harris passed away from Hodgkin's Disease on October 25, 2002.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNTA5ODg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU3MTU5Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001321","name":"Richard Harris","idIMDB":"nm0001321"},"actorId":"nm0001321","character":"Marcus Aurelius","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002130","main":true},{"actorName":"Derek Jacobi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001394","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMDkwNzI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkxODgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 October 1938","placeOfBirth":" Leytonstone, London, England, UK","birthName":"Derek George Jacobi","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Preeminent British classical actor of the first post-Olivier generation, Derek Jacobi was knighted in 1994 for his services to the theatre, and, in fact, is only the second to enjoy the honor of holding TWO knighthoods, Danish and English (Olivier was the other). Modest and unassuming in nature, Jacobi's firm place in theatre history centers around his fearless display of his characters' more unappealing aspects, their great flaws, eccentricities and, more often than not, their primal torment. Jacobi was born in Leytonstone, London, England, the only child of Alfred George Jacobi, a department store manager, and Daisy Gertrude (Masters) Jacobi, a secretary. His paternal great-grandfather was German (from Hoxter, Germany). His interest in drama began while quite young. He made his debut at age six in the local library drama group production of \"The Prince and the Swineherd\" in which he appeared as both the title characters. In his teens he attended Leyton County High School and eventually joined the school's drama club (\"The Players of Leyton\"). Derek portrayed Hamlet at the English National Youth Theatre prior to receiving his high school diploma, and earned a scholarship to the University of Cambridge, where he initially studied history before focusing completely on the stage. A standout role as Edward II at Cambridge led to an invite by the Birmingham Repertory in 1960 following college graduation. He made an immediate impression wherein his Henry VIII (both in 1960) just happened to catch the interest of Olivier himself, who took him the talented actor under his wing. Derek became one of the eight founding members of Olivier's National Theatre Company and gradually rose in stature with performances in \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun,\" \"Othello\" (as Cassio) and in \"Hay Fever\", among others. He also made appearances at the Chichester Festival and the Old Vic. It was Olivier who provided Derek his film debut, recreating his stage role of Cassio in Olivier's acclaimed cinematic version of Othello (1965). Olivier subsequently cast Derek in his own filmed presentation of Chekhov's Three Sisters (1970). On TV Derek was in celebrated company playing Don John in Much Ado About Nothing (1967) alongside Maggie Smith and then-husband Robert Stephens; Derek had played the role earlier at the Chichester Festival in 1965. After eight eventful years at the National Theatre, which included such sterling roles as Touchstone in \"As You Like It\", Jacobi left the company in 1971 in order to attract other mediums. He continued his dominance on stage as Ivanov, Richard III, Pericles and Orestes (in \"Electra\"), but his huge breakthrough would occur on TV. Coming into his own with quality support work in Man of Straw (1972), The Strauss Family (1972) and especially the series The Pallisers (1974) in which he played the ineffectual Lord Fawn, Derek's magnificence was presented front and center in the epic BBC series I, Claudius (1976). His stammering, weak-minded Emperor Claudius was considered a work of genius and won, among other honors, the BAFTA award. Although he was accomplished in The Day of the Jackal (1973) and The Odessa File (1974), films would place a distant third throughout his career. Stage and TV, however, would continue to illustrate his classical icon status. Derek took his Hamlet on a successful world tour throughout England, Egypt, Sweden, Australia, Japan and China; in some of the afore-mentioned countries he was the first actor to perform the role in English. TV audiences relished his performances as Richard II (1978) and, of course Hamlet, Prince of Denmark (1980). After making his Broadway bow in \"The Suicide\" in 1980, Derek suffered from an alarming two-year spell of stage fright. He returned, however, and toured as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company (1982-1985) with award-winning results. During this period he collected Broadway's Tony Award for his Benedick in \"Much Ado about Nothing\"; earned the coveted Olivier, Drama League and Helen Hayes awards for his Cyrano de Bergerac; and earned equal acclaim for his Prospero in \"The Tempest\" and Peer Gynt. In 1986, he finally made his West End debut in \"Breaking the Code\" for which he won another Helen Hayes trophy; the play was then brought to Broadway. For the rest of the 80s and 90s, he laid stage claim to such historical figures as Lord Byron, Edmund Kean and Thomas Becket. On TV he found resounding success (and an Emmy nomination) as Adolf Hitler in Inside the Third Reich (1982), and finally took home the coveted Emmy opposite Anthony Hopkins in the WWII drama The Tenth Man (1988). He won a second Emmy in an unlikely fashion by spoofing his classical prowess on an episode of \"Frasier\" (his first guest performance on American TV), in which he played the unsubtle and resoundingly bad Shakespearean actor Jackson Hedley. Kenneth Branagh was greatly influenced by mentor Jacobi and their own association would include Branagh's films Henry V (1989), Dead Again (1991), and Hamlet (1996), the latter playing Claudius to Branagh's Great Dane. Derek also directed Branagh in the actor's Renaissance Theatre Company's production of \"Hamlet\". In the 1990s Derek returned to the Chichester Festival, this time as artistic director, and made a fine showing in the title role of Uncle Vanya (1996). More heralded work of late include profound portrayals of the anguished titular painter in Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998), the role of Gracchus in the popular, Oscar-winning film Gladiator (2000), and sterling performances in such films as Two Men Went to War (2002), Bye Bye Blackbird (2005), The Riddle (2007), Endgame (2009), The King's Speech (2010), Jail Caesar (2012), and as the King in Cinderella (2015). Continuing to mesmerize on the stage, he has turned in superb performances in \"Uncle Vanya\" (2000), Friedrich Schiller's \"Don Carlos\" (2005), _A Voyage 'Round My Father (2006), \"Twelfth Night\" (2009) and the title role in \"King Lear\" (2010). On the British TV series front, he has commanded more recent attention in the title role of a crusading monk in the mystery series Mystery!: Cadfael (1994), as Lord Pirrie in Titanic: De sang et d'acier (2012), as Alan in Last Tango in Halifax (2012), and as Stuart Bixby in Vicious (2013). He and his life-time companion of three decades, Richard Clifford, filed as domestic partners in England in 2006. Clifford, a fine classical actor and producer in his own right, has shared movie time with Jacobi in Little Dorrit (1987), Henry V (1989), and the TV version of Cyrano de Bergerac (1985).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMDkwNzI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkxODgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001394","name":"Derek Jacobi","idIMDB":"nm0001394"},"actorId":"nm0001394","character":"Gracchus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002132","main":true},{"actorName":"Djimon Hounsou","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005023","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ2NTM4MzI4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkxMjcxNA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 April 1964","placeOfBirth":" Cotonou, Benin","birthName":"Djimon Gaston Hounsou","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"Djimon Hounsou was born in Cotonou, Benin, West Africa, to Albertine and Pierre Hounsou, a cook.

He was educated at Glyn College, Epsom, but while still a child, Hemmings made his first forays into the world of entertainment. An accomplished singer, he toured as a boy soprano with the English Opera Group, famed for his performances of the works of Benjamin Britten. Britten, who befriended the youngster, wrote some roles specifically for Hemmings, including that of \"Miles\" in \"The Turn of the Screw\". Hemmings subsequently took up painting after his career as a soprano was ended by his transit through puberty. He studied painting at the Epsom School of Art, where he staged the first exhibition of his work at the school when he was 15 years old. Hemmings made his film debut in 1954, with The Rainbow Jacket (1954) for Ealing Studios. He also had bit part in Otto Preminger's 1957 version of Saint Joan (1957). In his 20s, he returned to singing, appearing at nightclubs before concentrating on the stage and the cinema. As the youth culture hit Britain in the late 50s (the Notting Hill race riots of August 1958 limned in Julien Temple's 1986 film Absolute Beginners (1986) being a kind of bookmark signaling its arrival), Hemmings was in the right place at the right time to capitalize on his skills and looks. Boyish-looking, with large, protuberant blue eyes covered with heavy lids, his face was at once startling and decadent while simultaneously conveying an air of fragility. He starred in pop music movies Sing and Swing (1963) and Be My Guest (1965), as well as co-starring in one of Michael Winner's first films, The Girl-Getters (1964), with Oliver Reed. The 24-year-old Hemmings desperately wanted what would become his career-defining role, as the morally jaded fashion photographer Thomas in master-director Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-Up (1966). He was up against the crème of British actors, including Terence Stamp, who already had an Oscar nomination under his belt and was conventionally handsome. Hemmings thought he had blown his audition as Antonioni shook his head constantly throughout his audition. However, he later found out the great director had a mild form of Tourette's which caused him to move his head from side to side. The role made him a star and, for a while, a darling of the pop culture filmmaking that was expected to revolutionize the English-speaking cinema in the 1960s, after the 1964 Best Picture Oscar-win of Tony Richardson's Tom Jones (1963). He was cast as Mordred in the big-screen adaptation of Lerner & Lowe's musical Camelot (1967) with Richard Harris and Hemmings Blow-Up (1966) co-star Vanessa Redgrave to critically panned results. The same year that \"Camelot\" was released (1967), he put out a pop single (\"Back Street Mirror\") and an album, \"David Hemmings Happens\", recorded in Los Angeles. His album was produced by Jim Dickinson, the early producer of The Byrds, and featured instrumental backing by several members of group. It was re-released on CD in 2005. In 1968, he appeared as Dildano opposite Jane Fonda (in her incarnation as a sexpot) in Roger Vadim's kitsch klassic Barbarella (1968). However, to reduce stereotyping and his identification with pop culture filmmaking, he took on the role of the anti-hero Captain Nolan in Tony Richardson's masterful satire The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968) and later, the eponymous role in Alfred the Great (1969). While both films were imbued with the counter-cultural attitudes of their times, the roles themselves were rather straightforward. Hemmings had reached the summit of his career as an actor. These were the heights he never reached again. As the quality of his roles declined, Hemmings turned more to directing. He had directed his first film in 1972, helming the thriller Running Scared (1972) which starred Gayle Hunnicutt, his wife from 1968 to 1974. Hemmings also co-wrote the script. In the 1970s, he had relocated to Malibu, California to live with Hunnicutt, and the fabled beach community which was his home for the next generation. In 1975, he starred as Bertie Wooster in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, \"Jeeves\", one of Lord Webber's few flops. Hemmings formed the independent production company Hemdale Corp. with his business partner, John Daly, in the early 1970s as a tax shelter. He was able to use Hemdale and his role as a producer to vivify his directing career. In 1979, Hemmings the director first attracted major attention with Just a Gigolo (1978), but the film was a flop in spite of its interesting cast. After directing the 1981 adventure film Treasure of the Yankee Zephyr (1981) and an adaptation of James Herbert's novel \"The Survivor\", he focused on TV directing. He soon became one of the top directors of American action TV programs, including The A-Team (1983), Airwolf (1984), Magnum, P.I. (1980) and Quantum Leap (1989). However, in the nineties, he abandoned directing, and returned to live in the UK. The role of \"Cassius\" in Gladiator (2000) heralded his full-time return to acting. He was also memorable in a small role in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002). But it was his last major role, in the cinema adaption of Graham Swift's Last Orders (2001), that showed Hemmings at the top of his talent. Unrecognizable from the boy-man of 1966-70, he was memorable as the ex-boxer who ruefully remembers the past with his remaining buddies as they travel to throw the ashes of a departed friend into the sea. That two of the other major roles were filled by Michael Caine and Tom Courtenay, two other British actors whose careers first flourished in the 1960s, added to the poignancy of this tale of men trying to recapture lost time. He also appeared, less memorably, in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) opposite the ultimate 60s male British cinema icon, Sean Connery. David Hemmings died of a heart attack on December 3, 2003, in Bucharest, Romania, on the set of Blessed (2004), after playing his scenes for the day. He was 62 years old. His autobiography, \"Blow Up... and Other Exaggerations\" was published in 2004.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3OTY3Mjk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTkyNTM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376101","name":"David Hemmings","idIMDB":"nm0376101"},"actorId":"nm0376101","character":"Cassius","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0190217","main":true},{"actorName":"Tommy Flanagan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281107","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxOTQxMzA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMwOTY1MjE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 July 1965","placeOfBirth":" Glasgow, Scotland, UK","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Tommy Flanagan was born and raised in Glasgow, Scotland. In his twenties, Tommy made his living as a DJ for local dance clubs until a violent attack nearly ended his life. In hospital, his friend Robert Carlyle persuaded Tommy to give acting a try. Mr. Flanagan joined Carlyle's Raindog Theatre Company where he made his stage debut in such productions as 'Wasted I and II', 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', and 'MacBeth'. Tommy worked in various local and smaller film and television projects until he landed a small role in Mel Gibson's epic 'Braveheart' in 1995. Mr. Gibson was so impressed that he expanded the role of rebel Morrison specifically for Tommy, exposing a worldwide audience to Mr. Flanagan. Following this, Tommy went on to work with an array of top directors in films such as Phillip Noyce's 'The Saint', John Woo's 'Face/Off', and David Fincher's 'The Game'. In 1999, he would get the chance to once again work with Robert Carlyle in 'Plunkett and MacCleane'. That same year, Tommy earned critical praise and numerous 'Best Actor' nominations for his role as 'Da', the troubled father in Lynne Ramsay's 'Ratcatcher'. The film earned 'Best Director' awards by many European film festivals including the London Film Critics Circle and the BAFTA 2000 awards. In 2000, Tommy displayed more facets as an actor, starring in Art Linson's 'Sunset Strip' for director Adam Collis, where he played a mysterious 1970's hearth-throb, rock star. He then played the role of 'Cicero', a faithful retainer of Russell Crowe's character in the Academy Award-winning 'Gladiator' for director Ridley Scott. Tommy's focused and intense portrayal once again earned him praise and recognition. Tommy followed this up with roles in the indie features 'Dead Dogs Lie' and 'Strictly Sinatra', as well as the USA Network mini-series 'Attila' opposite Gerard Butler, New Line's 'All About the Benjamins' opposite Ice Cube, and 'Trauma' opposite Colin Firth. In 2004, Tommy starred in 20th Century Fox's 'Alien vs. Predator' for director Paul W.S. Anderson, and followed that up in 2005 with Miramax films 'Sin City' for director Robert Rodriguez. And in 2006, Tommy played the pivotal role of the 'Stranger' terrorizing Camilla Belle in Simon West's re-make of 'When a Stranger Calls'. Tommy then played the enigmatic hit man 'Lazlo Soot' in Joe Carnahan's 'Smokin' Aces'. In 2008, Tommy joined Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal in FX Network's drama, 'Sons of Anarchy' (SOA), one of the highest rated shows for the network, running for seven seasons. A huge success with a devoted following, SOA was initially based upon Hamlet by creator / show-runner Kurt Sutter. Often criticized for graphic violence, SOA was snubbed by award panels despite praise by critics and viewers. Mr. Flanagan portrayed Filip 'Chibs' Telford, a stalwart member of the, \"Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original\" (SAMCRO). Scottish by birth and raised in Belfast, Ireland, Chibs joined the IRA and the Belfast Chapter of Sons of Anarchy before events necessitated his transition to SAMCRO. The name Chibs refers to Scottish slang for a knife/ \"street knife\" (per Mr. Flanagan), a choice by Kurt Sutter referencing the real facial scarring Mr. Flanagan received in a near-fatal attack in his native Glasgow. Known as a \"Glasgow smile\" or \"Glasgow grin\" it is a highly distinctive regional form of violence and Sutter utilized it within the show. Mr. Flanagan himself is often questioned about his scarring and was quoted in Vulture 11/12/2014, \"I don't see the scars anymore. They're just ancient history now. It was a horrible thing that happened 20 years ago. I don't give it a second thought. It's just like a big wrinkle on my face.\" Tommy continues to create great roles in other hit series and films, gaining greater visibility and wider dramatic roles, including critically acclaimed UK drama ' Winter' by Heidi Greensmith, in which he plays an emotionally tortured painter trying to keep his family together after the sudden loss of his wife. Among other notable roles, Mr. Flanagan stars in 'The Jesuit' opposite Tim Roth and fellow Braveheart alum Brian Cox. In 2016 he adds 'Sand Castle, set during the Iraq War and 'Running Wild' with Sharon Stone.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxOTQxMzA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMwOTY1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281107","name":"Tommy Flanagan","idIMDB":"nm0281107"},"actorId":"nm0281107","character":"Cicero","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0190218","main":true},{"actorName":"Sven-Ole Thorsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861752","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MTI2OTg5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYyOTUwOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 September 1944","placeOfBirth":" Copenhagen, Denmark","height":"6' 5\" (1.96 m)","bio":"Born in Denmark, Sven-Ole Thorsen has a remarkable sporting background as a champion bodybuilder, champion power-lifter, and karate black belt that made him an obvious choice for movies roles as \"muscle for hire.\" The hulking 6' 5\" actor first came to attention as one of Thulsa Doom's bodyguards...
