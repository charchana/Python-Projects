His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside (1967), The Virginian (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Witness (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope. On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4Mjg0NjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM2NTI3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148","name":"Harrison Ford","nicknames":["Harry"],"idIMDB":"nm0000148"},"actorId":"nm0000148","character":"Rick Deckard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002841","main":true},{"actorName":"Rutger Hauer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000442","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY4MjI0MjgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0MDkyODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 January 1944","placeOfBirth":" Breukelen, Utrecht, Netherlands","birthName":"Rutger Oelsen Hauer","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"Blonde, blue-eyed, tall and handsome Dutch actor Rutger Hauer has an international reputation for playing everything from romantic leads to action heroes to sinister villains. Hauer was born in Breukelen, a town in the province of Utrecht, the Netherlands. He is the son of Teunke (Mellema) and Arend Hauer, both actors. Because his parents were often touring, he and his three sisters were raised by a nanny. A bit of a rebel during his childhood, he chafed at the rules and rigors of school and was often getting into mischief. His grandfather had been the captain of a schooner and at age 15, Hauer ran away to work on a freighter for a year. Like his great-grandfather, Hauer is color-blind, which prevented him from furthering his career as a sailor. Upon his return he attended night school and started working in the construction industry. When he again bombed at school, his parents enrolled him in drama classes. Fancying himself a poet, he spent most of his time writing poetry and hanging out in Amsterdam coffee houses instead of studying. He was expelled for poor attendance and afterward spent a brief period in the Dutch navy. Deciding he didn't like military life, he convinced his superiors that he was mentally unfit and was sent to a special home for psych patients. It was an unpleasant place, but Hauer remained there until he convinced his ranking officers that the military really did not need him.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY4MjI0MjgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0MDkyODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000442","name":"Rutger Hauer","nicknames":["The Dutch Paul Newman"],"idIMDB":"nm0000442"},"actorId":"nm0000442","character":"Roy Batty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002845","main":true},{"actorName":"Sean Young","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000707","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlNjAxZTctMGJlNS00ZWYwLWFiYTctNGJmM2FhNTZiNjQyL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIzODg1ODM@._V1_UY44_CR23,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 November 1959","placeOfBirth":" Louisville, Kentucky, USA","birthName":"Mary Sean Young","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Mary Sean Young was born on November 20, 1959 in Louisville, Kentucky. She is the daughter of Lee Guthrie (née Mary Lee Kane), an Emmy-nominated producer, screenwriter, public relations executive, and journalist, and Donald Young, Jr., an Emmy award winning television news producer and journalist. She has Irish, English, and Swiss-German ancestry. She grew up with an older brother Donald Young III and a sister Cathleen Young in Cleveland, Ohio. She attended Cleveland Heights High School, and then transferred to and graduated from Interlochen Arts Academy. A trained dancer, she studied at the School of American Ballet in New York City, and did some modeling. Sean Young began a promising film career by acting in a Merchant-Ivory film Jane Austen in Manhattan (1980) for Academy Award nominated director James Ivory, She followed that up in the comedy hit film Stripes (1981) for Academy Award nominated producer-director Ivan Reitman. Soon, important directors were casting her in their films, such as Garry Marshall in Young Doctors in Love (1982), Academy Award nominee David Lynch in Dune (1984), and Academy Award nominee Ridley Scott in Blade Runner (1982) in what is her most respected film. 1987 was a big year for her, since she appeared in two big movies. Academy Award winner Oliver Stone cast her in the hit film Wall Street (1987) but she clashed openly with him and with co-star Charlie Sheen and her role was drastically cut. However, her other hit film No Way Out (1987), which involved a famous steamy scene in the backseat of a limousine with Kevin Costner, gave her star status. She was at the height of her fame, which led to her being cast as Vicky Vale in Batman (1989). She had an accident while she was training for the film. As a result, she lost the role to Kim Basinger for what turned out to be the biggest hit of 1989. Young's loss didn't stop there. In 1988, she made a flop film with James Woods titled The Boost (1988). Woods accused her of exotic harassment, including leaving a disfigured doll outside his home and leaving scary phone calls to his then-fiancée. Young denied an affair with him or of harassing him, since she was in a long relationship with actor/singer Robert Lujan, whom she had met on a TV mini-series in 1985. They settled out of court, but the bad publicity hurt her career very deeply while Woods remained unscathed. Hollywood producers now saw her as unstable and a loose cannon and stopped considering her for big movies. She was dropped from Dick Tracy (1990) in favor of Glenne Headly. The \"Batman\" franchise decided to make a sequel to the 1989 blockbuster with Batman Returns (1992), but the producers wouldn't see Young for the role of Catwoman, She was outraged and went on national television, dressed up as Catwoman, and complained about how the producers should have had the courtesy to see her especially since she had been part of the original cast of the first Batman movie before her accident had her being replaced. This stunt, too, turned into a public relations mess, and the role of Catwoman went to Michelle Pfeiffer. Young put on a brave face and gamely moved on to do comedies Fatal Instinct (1993) for director Carl Reiner, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), the latter's box office success made Jim Carrey a star, who immediately landed the role of the Riddler in the Batman sequel. The film also raised Courteney Cox's profile, since she soon landed the hit TV show \"Friends\" which made her a household name. Sean thought the film's success would benefit her as well, especially since Academy Award-nominated directors such as Gus Van Sant and Ismail Merchant cast her in their films. However, these films weren't hits, and Hollywood kept giving her lackluster roles in mediocre films. Heartbroken, she married Lujan and moved to Arizona, where she had two sons, but they divorced in 2002. She suffered other losses as well, bearing the painful deaths of her father (in 1995) and her mother (in 2012). There were some bizarre incidents along the way: her heckling a winner at the Director's Guild of America Award show in 2008, her arrest at the 2012 Academy Award after-party when she slapped a security guard. She went to rehab for her alcohol problem and also appeared on the reality show \"Celebrity Rehab\". Since then, she has mellowed, because she had reconciled with her ex-husband and her children are now grown. She branched out to do stage work, including the Los Angeles production of \"Stardust\" and the Northport production of \"Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike\" for which she received a good review from the \"New York Times.\" In her 50s, she is keeping busy, by acting in several projects and trying to start a directing career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlNjAxZTctMGJlNS00ZWYwLWFiYTctNGJmM2FhNTZiNjQyL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIzODg1ODM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000707","name":"Sean Young","idIMDB":"nm0000707"},"actorId":"nm0000707","character":"Rachael","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002844","main":true},{"actorName":"Edward James Olmos","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001579","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzODQzODQ4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDczMTkxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 February 1947","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Edward James Olmos was born in Los Angeles, California, to Eleanor (Huizar) and Pedro Olmos, who was a mail carrier and welder. His family was of Mexican descent. If Olmos had followed the first love of his life, he would have been a professional baseball player. But by age 13, another love entered his life: rock music. By age 15, he was already an experienced rock singer, forming and reforming several \"garage bands\" along the way. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he played the most famous clubs on Sunset Strip, including Gazzarri's and The Factory. But a friend suggested that, with his flair for the dramatic, he consider a career in acting. Throughout the 1970s, he divided his time between rock music gigs, acting classes, bit parts in television, Off-off-off Broadway plays and his business of moving fine furniture (which kept body, soul and family together). His first big break was a starring role in Luis Valdez's play, \"Zoot Suit\", in 1978. The play moved to Broadway and led to a Tony Award nomination and great critical acclaim. Perhaps best known for his role as Lt. Martin Castillo in the NBC television series Miami Vice (1984) (1984-1989), Olmos has been seen in numerous film and television productions. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his starring role in Stand and Deliver (1988). Most notable of his recent offerings is American Me (1992), which was also his directing debut. But acting, directing and screenwriting are only parts of what he does. Olmos contends he would much rather be known as an activist than an actor. He devotes much of his time to causes, particularly those focusing on the needs and rights of children. He makes, on average, some 150 personal appearances a year to places where he can reach kids at risk; juvenile halls, detention centers, boys/girls clubs, schools. Anywhere he can get across his message that \"we all have a choice\" about where life takes us. Olmos stresses the importance of education, the risks of gang life and tries to promote the notion of taking responsibility for one's own actions and one's own happiness in life. Using his own \"disadvantaged background\" as an example (he grew up in East Los Angeles, infamous for its gang problems), he tells the kids, \"If I can do it, so can you\". And he tries to point them in a positive direction. He has served as an ambassador for UNICEF and has received numerous accolades for his activism. He will long be remembered for getting out in the thick of the Los Angeles Riots of 1992 with his broom: one calm, reasonable presence in the midst of chaos and gunfire. Edward James Olmos was married to actress Lorraine Bracco. Between them they have 6 children, ages 10 - 25.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzODQzODQ4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDczMTkxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001579","name":"Edward James Olmos","nicknames":["EJO","Ed","Eddie"],"idIMDB":"nm0001579"},"actorId":"nm0001579","character":"Gaff","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002842","main":true},{"actorName":"M.

Emmet Walsh has made a solid career of playing corrupt cops, deadly crooks, and zany comedic roles since the early 1970s. Michael Emmet Walsh was born in Ogdensburg, to Agnes Katharine (Sullivan) and Harry Maurice Walsh, a customs agent. He is of Irish descent. Walsh first appeared in a few fairly forgettable roles both on TV and onscreen before cropping up in several well remembered films, including a courtroom police officer in What's Up, Doc? (1972), as the weird Dickie Dunn in Slap Shot (1977), and as a loony sniper hunting Steve Martin in The Jerk (1979). On-screen demand heated up for him in the early 1980s with attention-grabbing work in key hits, including Brubaker (1980), Reds (1981), and as Harrison Ford's police chief in the futuristic thriller Blade Runner (1982). Walsh then turned in a stellar performance as the sleazy, double-crossing private detective in the Joel Cohen and Ethan Coen film noir Blood Simple. (1984), and showed up again for the Coens as a loud-mouthed sheet-metal worker bugging Nicolas Cage in the hilarious Raising Arizona (1987). As Walsh moved into his fifties and beyond, Hollywood continued to offer him plenty of work, and he has appeared in over 50 movies since passing the half-century mark. His consistent ability to turn out highly entertaining portrayals led film critic Roger Ebert to coin the \"Stanton-Walsh Rule,\" which states that any film starring Walsh or Harry Dean Stanton has to have some merit.

His mother was an elementary school teacher and his father was a landscape designer. William served two years in the US Army. Following his military service he attended Southern Methodist University. He earned both a BBA degree and a JD law degree from Memphis State University. William went to New York to try his luck as an actor. He studied his craft with Herbert Berghof and William Hickey. Sanderson began his acting career in off-Broadway stage productions and appeared in several independent pictures. He gave a superbly lively and intense performance as vicious racist and escaped convict Jessie Lee Kane in the brutal exploitation feature Fight for Your Life (1977). William was likewise marvelous as gentle toymaker J.F. Sebastian in the fantastic science-fiction cult favorite Blade Runner (1982). He has played his fair share of loathsome bad guys (he refers to these particular characters as \"prairie scum\"), such as nasty lout Calvin in Raggedy Man (1981), lowlife hick Lee Dollarhide in Coal Miner's Daughter (1980) and weaselly criminal Snow in Lone Wolf McQuade (1983). Not surprisingly, considering his distinctive Southern drawl, he has also appeared in such westerns as the comedy Wagons East (1994), Crossfire Trail (2001), Monte Walsh (2003), Andersonville (1996), Gods and Generals (2003) and the acclaimed TV mini-series Lonesome Dove (1989) (one of several projects in which Sanderson has acted alongside Tommy Lee Jones). Sanderson gave a lovely and touching portrayal in a rare lead role as emotionally dysfunctional recovering alcoholic ukulele minstrel Stanley Myer in the poignant indie drama Stanley's Gig (2000). He achieved his greatest popularity, however, as flaky backwoodsman Larry on the hit sitcom Newhart (1982) on which he uttered the memorable catchphrase, \"I'm Larry. This is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl.\" More recently Sanderson had a terrific role as conniving hotel proprietor E.B. Farnum on the sensationally gritty cable western TV series Deadwood (2004).

She grew up in a creative environment as the daughter and granddaughter of artists. At an early age she engaged in painting and sculpture and went on to major in art at Syracuse University in New York. During her time there she married Kennard C. Kobrin in 1964, a doctor in residency, and found work as a fashion model to help work his way to a degree. The couple eventually moved to San Francisco, where her husband set up a psychiatric practice; Joanna continued modeling and gave birth to a son and daughter. Following their divorce ten years later, she decided to move to Los Angeles in a bid for an acting career. In between modeling chores and occasional commercial gigs, the reddish-haired beauty found minor, decorative work as an actress in such action fare as Steve McQueen's thriller Bullitt (1968), the Jason Robards drama Fools (1970), The Laughing Policeman (1973) starring Walter Matthau and The Outfit (1973) with Robert Duvall. Her first co-starring role came opposite George C. Scott in the offbeat comedy caper Bank Shot (1974). Television became an important medium for her in the late 1970s, with guest parts on all the popular shows of the time, both comedic and dramatic, including Dallas (1978). Trapper John, M.D. (1979), Taxi (1978), Starsky and Hutch (1975), Charlie's Angels (1976), Lou Grant (1977) and a recurring role on Falcon Crest (1981). A regular on the sketch/variety show Shields and Yarnell (1977), which showcased the popular mime couple, Joanna languished in three failed series attempts--The Roller Girls (1978), 240-Robert (1979) and The Family Tree (1983)--before hitting the jackpot with the sitcom Buffalo Bill (1983) opposite Dabney Coleman, in which she finally had the opportunity to demonstrate her flair for offbeat comedy. The show became that's season's critical darling, with Coleman playing a vain, sexist, obnoxious talk show host (a variation of his popular 9 to 5 (1980) film character) and Joanna received a Golden Globe for her resourceful portrayal of Jo Jo White, the director of his show and romantic foil for Coleman, who stood toe-to-toe with his antics. The 1980s also brought about positive, critical reception for Joanna on film as well, especially in a number of showy portrayals, notably her snake-dancing replicant in the futuristic sci-fi thriller Blade Runner (1982), her radio journalist involved with Nick Nolte and Ed Harris in the political drama Under Fire (1983) and her co-starring role in a wacky triangle with Bob Hoskins and a hyperkinetic hare in the highly ambitious part toon/part fantasy film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Back on the TV front she was seen in recurring roles on L.A. Law (1986), Diagnosis Murder (1993), The District (2000) and Boston Legal (2004). Since then Joanna has juggled a number of quality film and TV assignments, a definitive highlight being her Emmy-nominated recurring role as a quirky, capricious mother/psychiatrist in the cult cable series Six Feet Under (2001). More recently she has taken part in more controversial film work that contain stronger social themes such as Anthrax (2001), a Canadian political thriller whose storyline feeds on the fear of terrorism; The Virgin of Juarez (2006), which chronicled the murders of hundreds of Mexican women; and the gay-themed pictures Kiss the Bride (2007) and Anderson's Cross (2010). Off-camera Joanna is devoted to her art (painting, sculpting) and is a dedicated animal activist as well as golfer and antique collector. She presently resides in the Los Angeles area with her dogs.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMTc0MzMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYwODgwNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001026","name":"Joanna Cassidy","idIMDB":"nm0001026"},"actorId":"nm0001026","character":"Zhora","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002848","main":true},{"actorName":"James Hong","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393222","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MTQxOTA4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE1OTcyMjE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 February 1929","placeOfBirth":" Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"James Hong was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

He majored in theater at the UCLA in the 60s, appearing in numerous student films, including one for Ray Manzarek, keyboardist of The Doors. From the UCLA, Pyke continued to a career as a character actor in low-budget, independent, films in the 70s and 80s, such as Dolemite and The First Nudie Musical. He specialized in manic, hysterical and borderline insane characters, going out of his way to steal every scene he appeared in. His long monologue scene in Richard Blackburn's Lemora: A Child's Tale of the Supernatural (1975), otherwise a somber, underplayed film, is arguably Pyke's greatest scenery-chewing moment. In the 70s, Pyke's physical appearance was as distinctive as his acting. He was very short, overweight, moustached and had rapidly balding Einstein hair. A character born to play Sancho Panza, which he eventually did, in The Erotic Adventures of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (1976). Pyke also appeared in some bigger-budgeted mainstream films, most notably as the bar owner Taffey Lewis in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982). He also had a small role in the Grace Jones vehicle Vamp (1986). The majority of Pyke's mainstream appearances were very brief. During the 80s, his acting career slowed down and he moved over to TV commercials, making only occasional film appearances. His last larger part to date was in the horror movie Hack-o-Lantern (1990). He is now living in Los Angeles, California, and is still performing as a comedian at clubs and parties. Pyke has also contributed pieces about his experiences working in low-budget films to two books: Gods In Polyester, A Survivors' Account Of 70's Cinema Obscura (Succubus Press/2004), and Gods In Spandex, A Survivors' Account Of 80's Cinema Obscura (Succubus
