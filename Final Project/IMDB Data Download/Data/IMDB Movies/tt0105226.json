He is of Italian (father) and Polish, German, and English (mother) descent. Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s. Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career. His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984). In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage (b.1992). In 2004, he married Alice Kim Cage, with whom he has a son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDM4Nzk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwNjExOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115","name":"Nicolas Cage","nicknames":["Nick"],"idIMDB":"nm0000115"},"actorId":"nm0000115","character":"Michael","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020758","main":true},{"actorName":"Craig Reay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714198","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNjY1ODg0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAwMzgy._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Craig Reay is an actor, known for Red Rock West (1993), El Diablo (1990) and Checkered Flag (1991).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNjY1ODg0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAwMzgy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714198","name":"Craig Reay","idIMDB":"nm0714198"},"actorId":"nm0714198","character":"Jim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Vance Johnson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0426390","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Vance Johnson is an actor, known for Red Rock West (1993) and Lady Mary (1995).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0426390","name":"Vance Johnson","idIMDB":"nm0426390"},"actorId":"nm0426390","character":"Mr. Johnson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Apel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0031987","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Robert Apel is an actor, known for Red Rock West (1993) and The Last Hard Men (1976).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0031987","name":"Robert Apel","idIMDB":"nm0031987"},"actorId":"nm0031987","character":"Howard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bobby Joe McFadden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0568658","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Bobby Joe McFadden is an actor, known for Red Rock West (1993), Tombstone (1993) and Sunstroke (1992).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0568658","name":"Bobby Joe McFadden","idIMDB":"nm0568658"},"actorId":"nm0568658","character":"Old Man","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"J.T.

Hopper was born on May 17, 1936 in Dodge City, Kansas, to Marjorie Mae (Davis) and James Millard Hopper. The young Hopper expressed interest in acting from a young age and first appeared in a slew of 1950s television series, including Medic (1954), Cheyenne (1955) and Sugarfoot (1957). His first film role was in Johnny Guitar (1954), which was quickly followed by roles in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Giant (1956) and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). Hopper actually became good friends with James Dean and was shattered when Dean was killed in a car crash on September 30, 1955. Hopper portrayed a young Napoléon Bonaparte (!) in the star-spangled The Story of Mankind (1957) and regularly appeared on screen throughout the 1960s, often in rather undemanding parts, usually as a villain in westerns such as True Grit (1969) and Hang 'Em High (1968). However, in early 1969, Hopper, fellow actor Peter Fonda and writer Terry Southern, wrote a counterculture road movie script and managed to scrape together $400,000 in financial backing. Hopper directed the low-budget film, titled Easy Rider (1969), starring Fonda, Hopper and a young Jack Nicholson. The film was a phenomenal box-office success, appealing to the anti-establishment youth culture of the times. It changed the Hollywood landscape almost overnight and major studios all jumped onto the anti-establishment bandwagon, pumping out low-budget films about rebellious hippies, bikers, draft dodgers and pot smokers. However, Hopper's next directorial effort, The Last Movie (1971), was a critical and financial failure, and he has admitted that during the 1970s he was seriously abusing various substances, both legal and illegal, which led to a downturn in the quality of his work. He appeared in a sparse collection of European-produced films over the next eight years, before cropping up in a memorable performance as a pot-smoking photographer alongside Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He also received acclaim for his work in both acting and direction for Garçonne (1980). With these two notable efforts, the beginning of the 1980s saw a renaissance of interest by Hollywood in the talents of Dennis Hopper and exorcising the demons of drugs and alcohol via a rehabilitation program meant a return to invigorating and provoking performances. He was superb in Rumble Fish (1983), co-starred in the tepid spy thriller The Osterman Weekend (1983), played a groovy school teacher in My Science Project (1985), was a despicable and deranged drug dealer in River's Edge (1986) and, most memorably, electrified audiences as foul-mouthed Frank Booth in the eerie and erotic David Lynch film Blue Velvet (1986). Interestingly, the offbeat Hopper was selected in the early 1980s to provide the voice of \"The StoryTeller\" in the animated series of \"Rabbit Ears\" children's films based upon the works of Hans Christian Andersen! Hopper returned to film direction in the late 1980s and was at the helm of the controversial gang film Colors (1988), which was well received by both critics and audiences. He was back in front of the cameras for roles in Super Mario Bros. (1993), got on the wrong side of gangster Christopher Walken in True Romance (1993), led police officer Keanu Reeves and bus passenger Sandra Bullock on a deadly ride in Speed (1994) and challenged gill-man Kevin Costner for world supremacy in Waterworld (1995). The enigmatic Hopper has continued to remain busy through the 1990s and into the new century with performances in The Night We Called It a Day (2003), The Keeper (2004) and Land of the Dead - Le territoire des morts (2005). As well as his acting/directing talents, Hopper was a skilled photographer and painter, having had his works displayed in galleries in both the United States and overseas. He was additionally a dedicated and knowledgeable collector of modern art and has one of the most extensive collections in the United States. Dennis Hopper died of prostate cancer on May 29, 2010, less than two weeks after his 74th birthday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNTQ5Nzg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2MDE4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000454","name":"Dennis Hopper","idIMDB":"nm0000454"},"actorId":"nm0000454","character":"Lyle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0105226","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105226","business":{"budget":{"money":"$8,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/1991/\">1991</a>"}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 38 min (98 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Stereo"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.37 : 1 (negative ratio)","1.66 : 1 (intended ratio)"],"camera":["Arriflex Cameras"],"laboratory":["DeLuxe, USA"],"filmLength":["2,596 m"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Texas Canyon, Arizona, USA"}],"rated":"R","awards":[{"award":"Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA 1995","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Saturn Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film","names":[]}]}]},{"award":"Film Independent Spirit Awards 1995","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Independent Spirit Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Director","names":[{"name":"John Dahl","id":"nm0001093","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Screenplay","names":[{"name":"John Dahl","id":"nm0001093","role":null},{"name":"Rick Dahl","id":"nm0196967","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"16,384","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0058765","name":"Propaganda Films"},{"idCompany":"co0106129","name":"PolyGram Filmed Entertainment"},{"idCompany":"co0007149","name":"Red Rock Films"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["surprise ending","hitman","texan","wyoming","money","hairy chest","bare chested male","running out of gas","cowboy boots","cowboy hat","stealing from a dead body","false identity","horse riding","oil rig","moose head","embezzlement","hidden gun","tequila","body landing on a car","kicked in the face","slamming a car door on someone's hand","country music","whiskey","wanted poster","wallet","unemployment","stolen money","stabbed in the throat","shot repeatedly","shot in the forehead","shootout","ranch","psychopath","police siren","police dispatching","office","loss of job","lie","knocked out","knife throwing","junk food","impound yard","impostor","honesty","hiding in a closet","hiding in a bathroom","held at gunpoint","floor safe","driver's license","deception","contract killer","coffee","cigarette smoking","car keys","beer","beating","ex marine","ceiling fan","vietnam veteran","rooftop","extramarital affair","police officer killed","roustabout","war injury","cemetery","mistaken identity","fugitive","small town","convenience store","texas","jail break","arson","marine veteran","motel","murder","murder for hire","black comedy","sheriff","gun","hospital","hit by a car","neo noir","chase","impalement","fire","freight train","gas station","car racing a train","bar","theft","independent film"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 02:06:37"}}
