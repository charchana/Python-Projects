On the left a large bay window through which may be seen the Grand Canal of the city of Venice. In the centre a colonnade and a hemicycle; to the right is a statue of the Madonna. At the beginning of the scene Romeo in his gondola sings to Juliet a sentimental song, then goes away. Hardly has he departed when the colonnade falls to pieces, disclosing the devil. Juliet, frightened, runs to the window and calls Romeo. The latter attempts to enter and protect his fiancée, but at a gesture from the devil the window is instantly covered with a grating and Romeo makes frantic efforts to break it. The devil begins to dance a wild dance before Juliet, who is beside herself from terror. The devil gradually becomes the size of a giant (a novel effect).

Méliès was an especially prolific innovator in the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color. His films include A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films. Méliès died of cancer on 21 January 1938 at the age of 76. In 2016, a Méliès film long thought lost, A Wager Between Two Magicians, was discovered in a Czechoslovak film archive.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNzM5MzEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3NzMyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0617588","name":"Georges Méliès","idIMDB":"nm0617588"},"actorId":"nm0617588","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0225504","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0225504","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 min"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["39.62 m"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"5.9","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"373","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0023239","name":"Georges Méliès"},{"idCompany":"co0015284","name":"Star-Film"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["devil","venice italy","romeo and juliet"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 02:51:41"}}
