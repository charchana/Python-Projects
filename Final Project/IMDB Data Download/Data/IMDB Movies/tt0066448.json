His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He only appeared in a handful of minor Broadway productions before joining the US Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama I Walk Alone (1948), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Seven Days in May (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Tough Guys (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: \"I've finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I've got nice-looking girls in my films now\". After appearing in \"I Walk Alone\", Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Champion (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955 Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti-war epic Paths of Glory (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas' insistence Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives. Douglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films,. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Lonely Are the Brave (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story In Harm's Way (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Cast a Giant Shadow (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western The War Wagon (1967). Additionally, in 1963 he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\", but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk's talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s Douglas wasn't as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy The Villain (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn 3 (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama L'homme de la rivière d'argent (1982). Unknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded in 1981 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 1983 with the Jefferson Award. Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remains active and continues to appear in front of the camera.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDc0MjI5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDE1MjM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000018","name":"Kirk Douglas","idIMDB":"nm0000018"},"actorId":"nm0000018","character":"Paris Pitman, Jr.","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0550270","main":true},{"actorName":"Henry Fonda","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000020","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEwNjQ2ODQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEwMTM2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 May 1905","placeOfBirth":" Grand Island, Nebraska, USA","birthName":"Henry Jaynes Fonda","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"Henry Jaynes Fonda was born in Grand Island, Nebraska, to Elma Herberta (Jaynes) and William Brace Fonda, who worked in advertising and printing.

Oates was born in Depoy, a very small Kentucky town. He was the son of Sarah Alice (Mercer) and Bayless Earle Oates, a general store owner. He attended high school in Louisville, continuing on to the University of Louisville and military service with the U.S. Marines. In college he became interested in the theatre and in 1954 headed for New York to make his mark as an actor. However, his first real job in television was, as it had been for James Dean before him, testing the contest gags on the game show Beat the Clock (1950). He did numerous menial jobs while auditioning, including serving as the hat-check man at the nightclub \"21\". By 1957 he had begun appearing in live dramas such as Studio One in Hollywood (1948), but Oates' rural drawl seemed more fitted for the Westerns that were proliferating on the big screen at the time, so he moved to Hollywood and immediately stared getting steady work as an increasingly prominent supporting player, often as either craven or vicious types. With his role as one of the Hammond brothers in the Sam Peckinpah masterpiece Ride the High Country (1962), Oates found a niche both as an actor and as a colleague of one of the most distinguished and distinctive directors of the period. Peckinpah used Oates repeatedly, and Oates, in large part due to the prominence given him by Peckinpah, became one of those rare character actors whose name and face is as familiar as those of many leading stars. He began to play roles which, while still character parts, were also leads, particularly in cult hits like Two-Lane Blacktop (1971) and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974). Although never destined to be a traditional leading man, Oates remained one of Hollywood's most valued and in-demand character players up until his sudden death from a heart attack on April 3, 1982 at the age of 53. His final two films, Tough Enough (1983) (filmed in late 1981) and Blue Thunder (1983) (filmed in early 1980), were released over one year after his death and were dedicated to his memory.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDUwMDkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3NDcyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643105","name":"Warren Oates","idIMDB":"nm0643105"},"actorId":"nm0643105","character":"Floyd Moon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Burgess Meredith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580565","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxOTk3MzY2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI3NTMyNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 November 1907","placeOfBirth":" Cleveland, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Oliver Burgess Meredith","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"One of the truly great and gifted performers of the century who often suffered lesser roles, Burgess Meredith was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1907 and educated in Amherst College in Massachusetts before joining Eva Le Gallienne's stage company in New York City in 1933.

Meredith served in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II, reaching the rank of captain. He continued in a variety of dramatic and comedic roles until being named an unfriendly witness by the House Un-American Activities Committee in the early 1950s, whereupon studio work disappeared. His career picked up again, especially with television roles, in the 1960s, although younger audiences know him best for either the Rocky (1976) or Grumpy Old Men (1993) films. Meredith also did a large amount of commercial work, serving as the voice for Skippy Peanut Butter and United Air Lines, among others. He was also an ardent environmentalist who believed pollution one of the greatest tragedies of the time, and an opponent of the Vietnam War.

The balding performer may not have been a household name, but he was a regular face in movies and TV for over four decades. Randolph was born Emanuel Cohen in New York City, New York, to Jewish immigrants from Romania and Russia, Dorothy (Shorr), an insurance agent, and Louis Cohen, a hat manufacturer. When his father died and his mother remarried, his stepfather, Joseph Lippman, renamed him Mortimer. He began his dramatic training in the '30s, studying under Stella Adler and changing his name to the less ethnic moniker of \"John Randolph\". He served in the Army Air Force during WWII and married actress Sarah Cunningham in Chicago in 1945 while performing in Orson Welles's stage production of \"Native Son\". They had two children, Martha and Harrison. After the war, Randolph become one of the original members of the Actors Studio. After making his film debut with The Naked City (1948), his passionate, outspoken leftist views and defense of other accused figures led to Randolph and his wife being blacklisted. In 1955, they were both called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and pleaded the Fifth Amendment. Although Randolph lost many jobs during this 15-year blacklist, he continued to find work onstage, mainly in New York. Finally, director John Frankenheimer broke the Hollywood blacklist after casting Randolph, along with fellow \"marked\" actors Will Geer and Jeff Corey, in Seconds (1966), in which he played a disillusioned older man surgically made to look decades younger (now played by Rock Hudson). Randolph continued to flourish in films and TV following this breakthrough with important roles in Serpico (1973), Frances (1982), Prizzi's Honor (1985) and You've Got Mail (1998), along with the TV movies The Missiles of October (1974) and \"Lincoln\" (1975) (mini). He also played the recurring role of Roseanne Barr's father on her popular sitcom. In 1987, he was the recipient of both Tony and Drama Desk awards for his close-to-home portrayal of a Communist, left-wing grandfather in Neil Simon's \"Broadway Bound\". Randolph continued his activism into the 1980s, heading the Council of American-Soviet Friendship, a cultural exchange organization. He died of natural causes at age 88.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxOTc1MzQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTMzNDk3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0709907","name":"John Randolph","idIMDB":"nm0709907"},"actorId":"nm0709907","character":"Cyrus McNutt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lee Grant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0335519","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NTQxMzI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMzMDU4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 October 1926","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Lyova Haskell Rosenthal","height":"5' 3¾\" (1.62 m)","bio":"Academy Award winner Lee Grant was born Lyova Haskell Rosenthal on October 31, 1926 in Manhattan, New York City, to Witia (Haskell), a teacher and actress, and Abraham Rosenthal, an educator and realtor. Her father was of Romanian Jewish descent, and her mother was a Russian Jewish immigrant. Lee made her stage debut at age 4 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, playing the abducted princess in \"L'Orocolo\". After graduating from high school, she won a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre, where she studied acting with Sanford Meisner. When she was a teenager Grant established herself as a formidable Broadway talent when she won The Critics' Circle Award for her portrayal of the shoplifter in \"Detective Story\". She reprised the role in the film version (Detective Story (1951), a performance that garnered her the Cannes Film Festival Citation for Best Actress as well as her first Academy Award Nomination. Immediately following her screen debut, however, Lee became a victim of the McCarthy-era blacklists in which actors, writers, directors, etc., were persecuted for supposedly \"Communist\" or \"progressive\" political beliefs, whether they had them or not. Except for an occasional role, she did not work in film or television for 10 years. In 1966 Lee re-started her acting career in the TV series Peyton Place (1964), for which she won an Emmy Award as Stella Chernak, and she later garnered her first Academy Award for Shampoo (1975), also receiving Academy Award nominations for The Landlord (1970) and Voyage of the Damned (1976). Since 1980 Lee has been concentrating on her directorial career, which began as part of the Women's Project at The Americal Film Institute (AFI); her adaptation of August Strindberg's, \"Stronger, The\" was consequently selected as one of the 10 best films ever produced for AFI. In 1987 she received an Academy Award for the HBO documentary, Down and Out in America (1986) and directed Nobody's Child (1986) for CBS, for which she received the Directors Guild Award. In 1983 she received the Congressional Arts Caucus Award for Outstanding Achievement in Acting and Independent Filmmaking. Subsequently, Women in Film paid tribute to her in 1989, with its first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award. Both the New York City Council and the County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors have recognized Ms. Grant for the contribution her films have made to the fight against domestic violence.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NTQxMzI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMzMDU4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0335519","name":"Lee Grant","idIMDB":"nm0335519"},"actorId":"nm0335519","character":"Mrs. Bullard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Arthur O'Connell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640023","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMjk0OTAyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgxMjcwOA@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 March 1908","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Though veteran character actor Arthur O'Connell was born in New York City in 1908, he looked as countrified as apple pie, looking ever more comfy in overalls than he ever did in a suit. He made his stage debut in the mid 1930s and came into contact with Orson Welles' Mercury Theatre. As a result, he earned the bit role of a reporter in the final scenes of Citizen Kane (1941). Making little leeway in films, O'Connell returned to the Broadway lights where he played Polonius in \"Hamlet\" and Banquo in \"Macbeth\", finally gaining considerable attention as the amiable bachelor storekeeper in \"Picnic\" in 1953. He transferred the role successfully to film three years later and began a series of flawed and forlorn characters on TV and the screen from then on. A particular standout was as James Stewart's boozed up attorney and mentor in Anatomy of a Murder (1959) for which he won his second Oscar-nomination for \"best supporting actor\" (the first was for Picnic (1956) three years earlier). The mustachioed O'Connell usually played wise, helpful and friendly, and he also inhabited crafty villains from time to time, but there was always an unhappy ambiance and 'loser' quality in his elderly gents, which made you feel sorry for him. He played Monte Markham's \"son\" (Markham had been frozen in an iceberg, which explains Markham's young appearance) in the 1967 sitcom \"The Second Hundred Years\" but the series was short-lived. A popular guest star on all the major shows in the 70s, he was forced to curtail his work load as the progression of Alzheimer's began to steadily creep in. At the time of his death in 1981, O'Connell was appearing solely in toothpaste commercials.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMjk0OTAyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgxMjcwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640023","name":"Arthur O'Connell","idIMDB":"nm0640023"},"actorId":"nm0640023","character":"Mr. Lomax","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Martin Gabel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0300010","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MzU1MTc5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 June 1912","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Martin Gabel was born on June 19, 1912 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.

Hale did his first movie as a baby and continued to act until his death. Unlike other child actors, Hale made a smooth transition in the movies and starred in several classics like Up Periscope (1959), The Lady Takes a Flyer (1957) and The West Point Story (1950), as well as many westerns. He did a lot of television guest appearances as well before getting his role as The Skipper on the cult comedy Gilligan's Island (1964). After the show went off the air, Hale continued to act and even teamed up with Gilligan co-star Bob Denver in the The Good Guys (1968), a CBS-TV comedy that lasted only two years. After that ended, Hale kept busy acting in guest shots and maintained his business interests which included a restaurant and travel agency.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMjY1ODIyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ1NDg5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001308","name":"Alan Hale Jr.","nicknames":["The Skipper"],"idIMDB":"nm0001308"},"actorId":"nm0001308","character":"Tobaccy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Victor French","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294229","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAyMjQ2NDk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyNTcxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 December 1934","placeOfBirth":" Santa Barbara, California, USA","birthName":"Victor Edwin French","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Victor French was the son of a stuntman. His debut was a small role in Lassie (1954), uncredited. He had his first real acting experiences in western-films, where he usually played the \"bad guy\" due to his rather gruff look. This changed with Little House on the Prairie (1974), (as Isaiah Edwards). In 1977, he left Little House on the Prairie (1974) to play in his own sitcom Carter Country (1977), which lasted for two seasons. French then teamed up again with Michael Landon in Highway to Heaven (1984), as (Mark Gordon). French, along with Leonard Nimoy, founded LA's \"Company of Angels\", one of the area's earliest attempts to establish LA as a type of \"Off-Broadway-West Coast\". Its limited seating arrangement (99 seats) served as the prototype of LA's Equity-Waiver code. After he left the company in the mid 1970s, he went on to teach acting privately. He was well sought-after, and it became apparent that he had to take students on \"by referral only\". His philosophy and style was gentle and encouraging to young actors just entering the field. He directed in LA Theaters and won the Critics Circle Award for \"12 Angry Men.\" In the 1980s, he declined to play \"bad guys.\" Victor French died 1989 after finishing the last episode of Highway to Heaven (1984).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAyMjQ2NDk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyNTcxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294229","name":"Victor French","nicknames":["Uncle Eddie"],"idIMDB":"nm0294229"},"actorId":"nm0294229","character":"Whiskey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Claudia McNeil","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0573871","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 August 1917","placeOfBirth":" Baltimore, Maryland, USA","bio":"Claudia McNeil was born on August 13, 1917 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

He played a lot of tough cops--sometimes crooked ones, sometimes racist ones, sometimes violent ones, sometimes a combination of all three--and a lot of tough soldiers, but he could also play a jovial family patriarch when called upon. Born and raised in New York, Freed began acting while attending Penn State University, and made his Broadway debut in 1942. His film debut occurred, oddly enough, in a musical--Carnegie Hall (1947)--and he went on to play everything from a gangster in a Ma and Pa Kettle movie (Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1950)) to a French army sergeant--a first-rate job, too--in the classic Paths of Glory (1957). It seems as if he appeared in just about every cop and detective series on TV at one time or another. He retired from acting in 1981, and died of a heart attack in Canada in 1994 while on a fishing trip with his son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NTE2NjA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5MTYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293099","name":"Bert Freed","idIMDB":"nm0293099"},"actorId":"nm0293099","character":"Skinner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0066448","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066448","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"03","month":"07","year":"1969","remarks":null},"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"10","month":"02","year":"1969","remarks":null},null],"copyrightHolder":"Warner Bros. - Seven Arts Inc."},"technical":{"runtime":["2 hr 6 min (126 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color (Technicolor)"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Technicolor"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Panavision (anamorphic)"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.1","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Mojave Desert, Arizona, USA"}],"rated":"R","awards":[],"votes":"2,899","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0026840","name":"Warner Bros."}],"keywords":{"keywords":["male taking bath in barrel","arizona","prison","warden","desert","escape","slapstick comedy","long brown hair","brunette","gunfight","shootout","sex in bed","kissing while having sex","bare breasts","bar shootout","opening action scene","five word title","ellipsis in title","broken spine","schoolteacher","governor","revenge","mexican border","integrity","jail break","gatling gun","rio grande","dining hall","food fight","saying grace","ex sheriff","american southwest","town council","1880s","reference to george armstrong custer","shot in the stomach","mule","solitary confinement","rolling a cigarette","corruption","bribery","music box","urinal","cell mate","zoom lens","betrayal","reference to moses","parrot","pool hall","camaraderie","loyalty","stabbed to death","judge","brothel madam","peephole","african american","chinese american","home robbery","interrupted whipping","poetry reading","shotgun","poetry recitation","clothes torn off","interrupted sex","caught having sex","long johns","sex on a billiard table","widow","voyeur","thief","theft","stealing","snake bite","sheriff","sex","rock pile","pursuit","prostitute","prison riot","prison break","peeping tom","peep hole","outlaw","nudity","money","male rear nudity","male nudity","horse","gun","gay","gay couple","ex gunfighter","caught with pants down","bordello","bloomers","bare butt","sweat","bare chested male","bare chested male bondage","punctuation in title","title based on poem","snake","horse riding","homosexual","harassment","censorship","back stabbing","artist","american frontier","whipping post","hard labor","beating","abuse","whipping","flogging","corporal punishment","rattlesnake","prison reform","jailbreak","brothel","hidden gold","penitentiary"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/13 19:02:43"}}
