For three years he was a financial analyst in the City in his native London but, on his own admission, hated it and applied almost simultaneously for the law and the stage. He had a place at bar school beginning on the same day as the start of his three year course at the Webber Douglas Academy - but the lure of the stage prevailed and he chose the academy,where he won the Amherst Webber Scholarship. His finals role was in 'Charley's Aunt' directed by Michael Fry,for whom he first worked professionally with the Lincolnshire touring company Great Eastern Stage playing an assassin in 'Shoot the Archduke'. Since then he has appeared on many stages,the Royal Court,the National,the Old Vic and on Broadway in Tom Stoppard's 'The Real Thing'. With a range extending from Pinter to musicals - most notably under layers of green make-up in the title role of 'Shrek - the Musical - he also took the Whatsonstage award as best supporting actor in 2011 for 'Broken Glass'. On television he has been nice,as Sally Phillips' kindly boyfriend in comedy 'Jam and Jerusalem', and nasty,as a sinister policeman investigating one of the 'Midsomer Murders' and on film as a fervent white Muslim in the black farce 'Four Lions'.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwOTUwMjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM5MDU3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512283","name":"Nigel Lindsay","idIMDB":"nm0512283"},"actorId":"nm0512283","character":"Mr. Heath","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rachael Spence","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5031557","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY2ZGEwMmItY2I3Mi00NWZjLWJjMjItYjc2NWM3ZWM5YjFkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI2ODE1NTQ@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Rachael Spence is an actress, known for The Best of Men (2012), Thirteen (2016) and EastEnders (1985).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY2ZGEwMmItY2I3Mi00NWZjLWJjMjItYjc2NWM3ZWM5YjFkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI2ODE1NTQ@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5031557","name":"Rachael Spence","idIMDB":"nm5031557"},"actorId":"nm5031557","character":"Mrs. Heath","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tracy Ann Oberman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643322","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NjA1NDY4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTEyNzUyMTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"August1966","placeOfBirth":" Brent, London, England, UK","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Tracy Ann Oberman was born in August 1966 in Brent, London, England.
