She moved to Los Angeles, CA when she was freshly 18 after filming her first feature film in Arizona. The film, The Crypt, was released in 2009 in select theaters all over of the US. Sarah played the lead character, PJ, and fell in love with on-camera acting after studying theater for so long. Sarah began acting when she was 13 in her school's theater program and was cast as a principal role in every single main stage production there on after. Her first acting performance was in a one-act show based on the book \"Go Ask Alice\" and she played the role of Alice. She was thrown into the acting world pretty abruptly, performing a live suicide by ODing on sleeping pills for her first ever role. And from then, Sarah was hooked. Sarah has also been singing and dancing since she was a little girl and still finds joy in practicing both. She grew up in the spot light and finds nothing more spiritually fulfilling than to perform. Sarah can be seen films such as in Lifetime movie Dirty Teacher (2013), Altergeist (2014), and Capture (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3446620","name":"Sarah Oh","idIMDB":"nm3446620"},"actorId":"nm3446620","character":"PJ","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mike Ranallo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3420911","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Mike Ranallo is an actor, known for The Crypt (2009), Paradise Hotel (2003) and Parallax (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3420911","name":"Mike Ranallo","idIMDB":"nm3420911"},"actorId":"nm3420911","character":"Perry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Abra May","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3571534","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Abra May is an actress, known for The Crypt (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3571534","name":"Abra May","idIMDB":"nm3571534"},"actorId":"nm3571534","character":"Gina","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cristen Irene","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2336412","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MjQwODg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk0NzgwMTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Cristen Irene Erber","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Cristen Irene was born as Cristen Irene Erber.
