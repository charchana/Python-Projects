Joseph was raised in a Jewish family with his late older brother, Dan Gordon-Levitt, who passed away in October 2010. His parents worked for the Pacifica Radio station KPFK-FM and his maternal grandfather, Michael Gordon, had been a well-known movie director. After working for several years as a child actor, Joseph became better known for starring on the hit television series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996), for which he earned two Hollywood Reporter Young Star Awards. In addition, the show earned three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for Outstanding Peformance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Prior to his success on television, Joseph had already worked steadily in feature films, debuting in the Robert Redford film A River Runs Through It (1992). He won a Young Artist Award for the latter film. During the 1990s, he also co-starred in the films Angels in the Outfield (1994), The Juror (1996), Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998), and 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). Following his work on 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996), Joseph took time off from acting to attend Columbia University. In the early 2000s, he broke from the mold of his television and film comedy supporting roles by appearing in a string of intense dramatic roles, mostly in smaller, independent films such as Manic (2001), with Don Cheadle; Mysterious Skin (2004), for writer/director Gregg Araki; Rian Johnson's award-winning debut film, Brick (2005); Lee Daniels' Shadowboxer (2005); the crime drama The Lookout (2007), which marked Scott Frank's directorial debut; John Madden's Killshot (2008), with Diane Lane and Mickey Rourke; and the controversial drama Stop-Loss (2008), in which he starred with Ryan Phillippe, under the direction of Kimberly Peirce. By 2009, Joseph was officially established as one of the leading men of indie cinema with his Golden Globe-nominated role in the comedy-drama 500 Days of Summer (2009), for which he also received an Independent Spirit Award nod. He also adapted the Elmore Leonard short story Sparks into a 24-minute short film that he directed (Sundance Film Festival 2009). In 2010, he headlined the indie drama Hesher (2010) and also established himself as a mainstream star in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010). Balancing both independent and Hollywood film, Joseph scored another Golden Globe nod for the cancer drama 50/50 (2011), directed by Jonathan Levine and also starring Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, and Bryce Dallas Howard. He worked again with director Nolan on The Dark Knight Rises (2012) (for which he received a People's Choice Award nomination for Favorite Movie Actor), and snagged leading roles in both Premium Rush (2012), directed by David Koepp, and Looper (2012), for which he reunited with his Brick director, Rian Johnson, and starred opposite Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt. Also in 2012, he played Abraham Lincoln's son Robert in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-nominated Lincoln (2012), with Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field. In 2013, Joseph Gordon-Levitt starred in his critically-acclaimed feature film directorial debut, Don Jon, from a script he wrote, opposite Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for \"Best First Screenplay\" for the film. Gordon-Levitt provided the voice of Jiro Horikoshi in the 2014 English-language version of Hayao Miyazaki's Academy Award-nominated animated feature The Wind Rises, and appeared in Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014), in which he played Johnny, a character Miller created for the film. Gordon-Levitt founded and directs hitRECord, an open collaborative production. hitRECord creates and develops art and media collectively using their website where anyone with an internet connection can upload their records, download and remix others' records, and work on projects together. When the results of these RECords are produced and make money, hitRECord splits the profits 50/50 with everybody who contributed to the final production. hitRECord has published books, put out records, gone on tour and has screened their work at major festivals including Sundance and TIFF. \"RegularJOE\" (as he's known on the site) is leading the community of over 300, 000 artists in its biggest collaboration yet, a new take on a variety show called \"HitRecord on TV!\" The half hour series, which Gordon-Levitt hosts, premiered in January on Participant Media's new cable network, Pivot and has been renewed for a second season.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzOTg0NTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4MTcwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","nicknames":["Joe","Joey","JGL","Regular Joe"],"idIMDB":"nm0330687"},"actorId":"nm0330687","character":"Jirô Horikoshi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0384979","main":true},{"actorName":"John Krasinski","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1024677","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MzY3MjQ3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI3NjQxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 October 1979","placeOfBirth":" Newton, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"John Burke Krasinski","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Tall, handsome American film and television star John Krasinski is probably best known for his role as sardonic nice guy \"Jim Halpert\" on NBC's popular TV series, The Office (2005), for which he won a 2007 and 2008 Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series. Born John Burke Krasinski on October 20, 1979, in Newton, Massachussetts, USA, he is the youngest of three brothers.

His first stage experience was starring in a satirical high school play, written and cast by B.J. Novak. Also good at sports, he played on the same Little League baseball team as B.J. Novak, now a writer and co-star on The Office (2005). After graduating from Newton South High School in 1997, Krasinski planned to be an English major and deferred his first semester of college to teach English in Costa Rica. He attended Brown University, graduating in 2001, as a playwright with honors, then studied at the Eugene O'Neill National Theatre Institute in Waterford, Connecticut. During the summer of 2000, he worked as a script intern on Late Night with Conan O'Brien (1993).

Blunt was born on February 23, 1983, in Roehampton, South West London, England, the second of four children in the family of Joanna Mackie, a former actress and teacher, and Oliver Simon Peter Blunt, a barrister. Her grandfather was Major General Peter Blunt, and her uncle is MP Crispin Blunt. Emily received a rigorous education at Ibstock Place School, a co-ed private school at Roehampton. However, young Emily Blunt had a stammer, since she was a kid of 8. Her mother took her to relaxation classes, which did not do anything. She reached a turning point at 12, when a teacher cleverly asked her to play a character with a different voice and said, \"I really believe in you\". Blunt ended up using a northern accent, and it did the trick, her stammer disappeared. From 1999 - 2001, Blunt went to Hurtwood House, the top co-ed boarding school where she would excel at sport, cello and singing. She also had two years of drama studies at Hurtwood's theatre course. In August 2000, she was chosen to perform at the Edinburgh Festival. She was signed up by an agent, Kenneth Mcreddie, who led her to the West End and the BBC, scoring her roles in several period dramas on stage as well as on TV productions, such as Foyle's War (2002), Henry VIII (2003) and Empire (2005). In 2001, she appeared as \"Gwen Cavendish\" opposite Dame Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of \"The Royal Family\" at Haymarket Theatre. For that role, she won the Evening Standard Award for Best Newcomer. In 2002, she played \"Juliet\" in \"Romeo and Juliet\" at the prestigious Chichester Festival. Blunt's career ascended to international fame after she starred as \"Isolda\" opposite Alex Kingston in Warrior Queen (2003). A year later, she won critical acclaim for her breakout performance as \"Tamsin\", a well-educated, cynical and deceptive 16-year-old beauty in My Summer of Love (2004), a story of two lonely girls from the opposite ends of the social heap. Emily Blunt and her co-star, Natalie Press, shared an Evening Standard British Film award for Most Promising Newcomer. In 2005, she spent a few months in Australia filming Irresistible (2006) with Susan Sarandon and Sam Neill. Blunt gave an impressive performance as \"Mara\", a cunning young destroyer who acts crazy and surreptitiously provokes paranoia in others. She also continued her work on British television, starring as \"Natasha\" in Stephen Poliakoff's Gideon's Daughter (2005), opposite Bill Nighy, a role that won her a 2007 Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role. She continued the line of playing manipulative characters as \"Emily\", a caustic put-upon assistant to Meryl Streep's lead in The Devil Wears Prada (2006). Blunt's performance with a neurotic twist added a dimension of sarcasm to the comedy, and gained her much attention as well as new jobs: in two dramas opposite Tom Hanks, then in the title role in the period drama, The Young Victoria (2009). Her most recent works include appearances as antiques dealer \"Gwen Conliffe\" in The Wolfman (2010) and as the ballerina in The Adjustment Bureau (2011). Emily Blunt is a highly versatile actress and a multifaceted person. Her talents include singing and playing cello; she is also skilled at horseback riding. She was in a relationship with Canadian singer Michael Bublé, whom she met at the Australian Logie Awards in 2005 and, again, a few months later, backstage at his Los Angeles concert. Their relationship ended in 2008. Blunt's friend, Anne Hathaway, introduced her to John Krasinski, and they have been together since November 2008. On August 28, 2009, Blunt and Krasinski announced their engagement. The couple married on July 10, 2010, at the estate of their friend, George Clooney, on Lake Como in Italy. Emily Blunt and John Krasinski are living in the Los Angeles area, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNDY4MTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg5NzM2Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434","name":"Emily Blunt","nicknames":["Em"],"idIMDB":"nm1289434"},"actorId":"nm1289434","character":"Nahoko Satomi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0407849","main":true},{"actorName":"Martin Short","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001737","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MDIyMDY1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzMDE5NTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 March 1950","placeOfBirth":" Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Martin Hayter Short","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Martin Short was born on March 26, 1950 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada as Martin Hayter Short.
