Sherry subsequently moved to Rome, Italy, where she established herself as a model prior to making her acting debut in the giallo La lame infernale (1974). Buchanan continued to act in both movies and TV commercials, but decided to take a hiatus from acting after she found out that a body double was used without her knowledge or consent for explicit hardcore insert scenes for the low-grade exploitation outing Deux supersensuelles (1979). Sherry returned to America to study sociology at Layola University in New Orleans and eventually moved back to Italy so she could resume acting in minor parts in a few movies prior to calling it a day as an actress in 1987.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjM2NDk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAxNTIzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0118076","name":"Sherry Buchanan","idIMDB":"nm0118076"},"actorId":"nm0118076","character":"Susan Kelly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter O'Neal","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641933","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Peter O'Neal is an actor, known for Zombie Holocaust (1980), Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) and Il Passatore (1977).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641933","name":"Peter O'Neal","idIMDB":"nm0641933"},"actorId":"nm0641933","character":"George Harper","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Donald O'Brien","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639521","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 September 1930","placeOfBirth":" Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France","birthName":"Donal O'Brien","bio":"Donald O'Brien was born on September 15, 1930 in Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France as Donal O'Brien.
