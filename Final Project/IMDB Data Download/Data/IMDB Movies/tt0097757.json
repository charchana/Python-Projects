René was born into an already artistic family, which included his grandfather, a well-known Swiss painter, and his father Fernand, a writer. The Auberjonois family moved to Paris shortly after World War II, and it was there that René made an important career decision at the age of six. When his school put on a musical performance for the parents, little René was given the honor of conducting his classmates in a rendition of \"Do You Know the Muffin Man?\". When the performance was over, René took a bow, and, knowing that he was not the real conductor, imagined that he had been acting. He decided then and there that he wanted to be an actor. After leaving Paris, the Auberjonois family moved into an Artist's Colony in upstate New York. At an early age, René was surrounded by musicians, composers and actors. Among his neighbors were Helen Hayes, Burgess Meredith and John Houseman, who would later become an important mentor. Houseman gave René his first theater job at the age of 16, as an apprentice at a theater in Stratford, Connecticut. René would later teach at Juilliard under Houseman. René attended Carnegie-Mellon University and studied theater completely, not only learning about acting but about the entire process of producing a play. After graduating from CMU, René acted with various theater companies, including San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater and Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum. In 1969, he won a role in his first Broadway musical, \"Coco\" (with Katharine Hepburn), for which he won a Tony Award. Since then, René has acted in a variety of theater productions, films and television presentations, including a rather famous stint as Clayton Endicott III on the comedy series Benson (1979), not to mention seven years on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) as Odo. René has also done dramatic readings of a variety of books on tape. René's most recent projects have included The Patriot (2000), starring Mel Gibson, and Sally Hemings: An American Scandal (2000). In the fall of 2000, he also appeared on NBC's Frasier (1993) and ABC's The Practice (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNjQ0NDc4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM3NTk0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041281","name":"Rene Auberjonois","idIMDB":"nm0041281"},"actorId":"nm0041281","character":"Louis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0044520","main":true},{"actorName":"Christopher Daniel Barnes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055549","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ0Y2NkZGItMTg0OS00OTlmLWIzZjAtNWM5YTJkN2VjMTA4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU0MjcwMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 November 1972","placeOfBirth":" Portland, Maine, USA","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Christopher Daniel Barnes was born on November 7, 1972 in Portland, Maine, USA.

At age 80 plus, the plucky comedienne shows no signs of stopping any time soon. The riotous Pat Carroll was born in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1927, the daughter of Kathryn Angela Meagher and Maurice Clifton Carroll. Her family moved to Los Angeles when Pat was five, and there began performing in local stage productions. She graduated from Hollywood's Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girls Catholic school, then attended Immaculate College, also in Los Angeles, and Catholic University of America. Following her college graduation, she began performing comedy in nightclubs and gained early experience with appearances in resort areas. Her stage debut in 1947 with a role in \"The Goose and the Gander\" starring Gloria Swanson led to hundreds of stock roles. She made her off-Broadway debut in the play \"Come What May\" in 1950. Also a talented singer, she earned a Tony nomination for her Broadway work in the singing revue \"Catch a Star\" in 1955, and then enjoyed a number of brash showcases in such musicals as \"On the Town,\" \"Once Upon a Mattress\" and \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\". It was, however, the \"golden age\" of TV that truly took advantage of Pat's adroit talents. An initial \"second banana\" regular on the variety programs The Red Buttons Show (1952) and The Saturday Night Revue (1953), she copped an Emmy award for her work on Caesar's Hour (1954) as Howard Morris' wife and earned fine reviews from her recurring role on the sitcom Make Room for Daddy (1953) playing Bunny Halper, the pert and plucky wife of Danny Thomas' nightclub manager Charlie Halper (Sid Melton). Pat's down-to-earth demeanor, chummy disposition and hearty, infectious laugh made her a popular guest on all the major talkfests and a welcomed panelist on such game shows as \"You Don't Say,\" \"To Tell the Truth,\" \"I've Got a Secret\" and \"Password\". In 1965, she co-starred on TV as one of the wicked stepsisters in the endearing Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical Cinderella (1965), which starred Lesley Ann Warren as the princess-to-be. In later years she won recurring/regular roles on the last season of Too Close for Comfort (1980) [retitled in 1986 as \"The Ted Knight Show\"] and the Suzanne Somers' sitcom She's the Sheriff (1987). As a character actress, the cropped-blond comedienne never made much of a dent in film, which included supporting roles in With Six You Get Eggroll (1968) with Doris Day and The Brothers O'Toole (1973) with John Astin. In the late 1970s her career received a huge shot in the arm with the award-winning, one-woman show \"Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein\", which she also produced and won multiple theater awards, including the Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk trophies. A complete departure from her usual comedy antics, audiences saw a burgeoning dramatic actress in the making. Taking the show on the road for four years, she also won a Grammy for her recorded version of the performance in 1981. She then returned to Broadway after thirty years to appear in the play \"Dancing in the End Zone\" (1985). Pat surprised her fans by continuing vigorously in this vein. She began taking on Shakespearean roles and earning critical acclaim. For her interpretations of Sir John Falstaff in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" and the Nurse in \"Romeo and Juliet\" she won bookend Helen Hayes awards. A life member of The Actors Studio, other challenging stage roles over the years have included Volpone, Mother Courage (another Helen Hayes award), the Stage Manager in \"Our Town\" and the Chorus in a Broadway revival of \"Electra\". Still interested in tickling the funny bone on occasion, she has performed in a number of adaptations of the wacky musical comedy \"Nunsense\" playing the Reverend Mother. If this weren't enough, she has extended herself into directing, helming a musical version of \"Alice in Wonderland\" for The Kennedy Center, as well as productions of \"Private Lives and \"The Supporting Cast\". Since the late 1980s Pat has become a voice-over favorite on numerous animated programs -- notably for Disney as the sea witch Ursula in The Little Mermaid (1989). She has three children (oldest son Sean and daughters Kerry and Tara) by late husband Lee Karsian, a one-time manager and talent agent. Tara Karsian is a character actress from stage, film and TV. Kerry Karsian' is a casting director.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMDkxNzc3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE4NjIzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140946","name":"Pat Carroll","idIMDB":"nm0140946"},"actorId":"nm0140946","character":"Ursula","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000627","main":true},{"actorName":"Paddi Edwards","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0250252","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0NzYzNTQ5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyNzQyOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 March 1931","placeOfBirth":" Bristol, England, UK","birthName":"Patricia Mary Ursula Edwards","bio":"Paddi Edwards was born on March 8, 1931 in Bristol, England as Patricia Mary Ursula Edwards.

Hackett always referred to himself as a \"saloon comic\" and preferred the intimacy of his stage act--where he would often bring members of the audience up on stage with him--to films and television. He, along with Lenny Bruce, pioneered \"blue\" comedy, although Hackett's career did not suffer nearly as much as Bruce's did because of it. Hackett's act was noted for its, at the time, \"adult\" content, and at one point he was sued by a woman who attended one of his shows and said she was \"shocked and offended\" at the language (she lost the suit). However, contrary to his nightclub image, Hackett's appearances in films were mostly of the family type, such as his roles in the \"Herbie\" series of comedies for Disney about a Volkswagen Bug with a mind of its own and as Robert Preston's sidekick in The Music Man (1962). In 1954, Hackett was paired by Universal Pictures with Hugh O'Brian as a potential comedy team to replace the studio's reigning team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, They actually did replace the famous team in the film Fireman Save My Child (1954), due to Costello's illness (Bud and Lou can still be glimpsed in long shots). Hackett took the part that Costello was playing (an eerie coincidence considering that more than 20 years later he would actually play Costello in the movie Bud and Lou (1978)) and O'Brian took Abbott's place, but the film was not successful and Universal dropped its plans to make a team out of the two. Hackett also had a showy part in the ensemble comedy It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963), partnered with Mickey Rooney. However, despite his success in movies, he still preferred his nightclub work and played Las Vegas and clubs in other cities whenever possible. He had a reputation among his fellow comics as a brilliant ad-libber and someone who knew exactly how far to take a joke before it ran its course, something not all comedians managed to do. Buddy Hackett died at age 78 of natural causes at his beach house in Malibu, CA, on June 30, 2003.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NjI1OTU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTgxNTcz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004983","name":"Buddy Hackett","idIMDB":"nm0004983"},"actorId":"nm0004983","character":"Scuttle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000590","main":true},{"actorName":"Jason Marin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0547465","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 July 1974","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","bio":"Jason Marin was born on July 25, 1974 in Brooklyn, New York, USA.

She retired when the dance teacher was arrested on a morals charge for \"dating\" the tall and lissome, yet underage, star dancer in the troupe. That girl's big number culminated with a back-bend where Edie drank a soda upside down (of course). Edie has a Master of Science from Syracuse and taught radio at the University of Missouri/Kansas City for eight years. There she re-entered the entertainment field as a DJ, newswoman and producer for the NPR affiliate KCUR-FM. Her proudest moment was portraying John Ehrlichman in Conversation 26 of the NPR national broadcast of the Nixon Tape Transcripts. Thus did Edie contribute to the peaceful overthrow of the government of an unindicted co-conspirator. Her career-long devotion to satirical improvisation included an impressive tenure with The Groundlings. She went on to create original characters, performed on the daytime The David Letterman Show (1980): Mrs. Marv Mendenhall, Dot Duncan, Whirly June Pickens, Officer Jeanelle Archer, 105-year-old Edie, etc. TV has been a home to many of Edie's characters--on The Richard Pryor Show (1977); as Lucille Tarlek, wife of mega-obnoxious ad salesman Herb Tarlek on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978); and as Mrs. Poole on Valerie (1986). Her movie career growth paralleled her ten years with The Groundlings. Her first film was the teen horror favorite Carrie (1976). She did several John Hughes films, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), She's Having a Baby (1988) and _Curly Sue (1990)_. Offbeat cult faves are Eating Raoul (1982), Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988), HBO's The Pee Wee Herman Show (1981) and Martin Mull's The History of White People in America (1985). In more mainstream films, she received a National Media Award for her portrayal of a mentally disabled woman in Bill: On His Own (1983), starring Mickey Rooney. She's acted for Robert Redford in A River Runs Through It (1992), for Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers (1994), for Diane Keaton in Raccroche!

At 16, he entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts where classmates included such future stars as Ida Lupino. Upon graduating, he acted in several West End stage productions. When WWII broke out, he enlisted and served in the Kings Royal Rifle Corps. He came to America in 1946 to attend a cousin's wedding and settled in Hollywood. He began his American acting career in radio, establishing himself as a master of dialects with such roles as Hey Boy, the Chinese servant, on \"Have Gun, Will Travel\" with John Dehner. His talent for dialects also kept him busy in the many WWII-related films and TV shows of the 1950s and '60s wherein he played countless Germans and Frenchmen as well as a variety of Englishmen for which he ensured the dialects were accurate depending on which part of England they were from. After years of radio, TV, stage and film work, he entered semi-retirement in the late 1970s, accepting occasional voice work and small guest appearances on TV. On June 16, 1989, after completing his last role, providing the voice of Grimsby in Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), he entered St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank for quadruple bypass surgery from which he never recovered. He died of heart failure July 2, 1989.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MmZlMjAtMzczMS00ZjQ4LWJiYzktOTBhZTY4NTQ1ODdmL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA4NDY2Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942220","name":"Ben Wright","idIMDB":"nm0942220"},"actorId":"nm0942220","character":"Grimsby","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000680","main":true},{"actorName":"Samuel E.

Their influential album, 'Gibson and Camp at the Gate of Horn', was recorded in Chicago in 1961. When they broke up, Camp continued to work as a solo act. He began using the name Hamilton Camp musically around the time his solo album 'Paths of Victory' was released in 1964. After working as a child actor, Camp began acting again in 1961 with the Second City in Chicago, and with The Committee in San Francisco in the mid-60s. This lead to television and theatre work, and the occasional film. During the 70s (after his acceptance into Subud, a spiritual community) he was sometimes credited as Hamid Hamilton Camp. He has occasionally returned to music over the years, and released a new album in 1999 called 'Mardi's Bard', dedicated to the late Mardi Arquette (the wife of Lewis, and mother of Rosanna, Patricia, David, Alexis & Richmond)","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0131985","name":"Hamilton Camp","idIMDB":"nm0131985"},"actorId":"nm0131985","character":"Additional Voices","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Debbie Shapiro Gravitte","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0336408","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 September 1954","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Debbie Shapiro","bio":"Debbie Shapiro Gravitte was born on September 29, 1954 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Debbie Shapiro.
