A liaison with Baron Balsan gives her an entrée into French society and a chance to develop her gift for designing increasingly popular hats. When she falls in love with English businessman Arthur Capel further opportunities open up, though life becomes ever more complicated.","simplePlot":"The story of Coco Chanel's rise from obscure beginnings to the heights of the fashion world.","actors":[{"actorName":"Audrey Tautou","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0851582","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTgyNjk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMwMjI1OQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 August 1976","placeOfBirth":" Beaumont, Puy-de-Dôme, France","birthName":"Audrey Justine Tautou","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Audrey Justine Tautou was born on August 9, 1976 in Beaumont, France, to Evelyne Marie Laure (Nuret), a teacher, and Bernard Tautou, a dental surgeon. Audrey showed an interest for comedy at an early age and started her acting lessons at 'Cours Florent'. In 1998 she won the best young actress award in the ninth 'Jeune Comedien de Cinema Festival' in Bezier. Then, she came to the attention of Tonie Marshall who gave her a role in her film Venus Beauty (1999) for which she won a Best New Actress Cesar. It came as a surprise to even Audrey: \"I was so certain I could not be chosen that I told her that she probably dialled a wrong number.\" The director chose her for her natural nature: \"She came, she gaffed, she turned reddish, her ears were in a funny position and her hair was relaxed. In five minutes, she gave me the heart of the character, a petite young girl who would like to be a lady and will become a woman.\" In 2000, Audrey was again nominated for a Cesar and her movie Amélie (2001) has been a phenomenal success worldwide.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzOTgyNjk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMwMjI1OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0851582","name":"Audrey Tautou","idIMDB":"nm0851582"},"actorId":"nm0851582","character":"Gabrielle Chanel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0048815","main":true},{"actorName":"Benoît Poelvoorde","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688143","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxODYxMDU4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc0OTUxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 September 1964","placeOfBirth":" Namur, Wallonia, Belgium","height":"6' 0¼\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Benoît Poelvoorde was born on September 22, 1964 in Namur, Wallonia, Belgium.
