Vernon, New York on March 26, 1966. His film work began in the late 1980s. An early part that brought him recognition was in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), as Spider, a local kid who works for the gangsters and has a run-in with a psychopathic mob soldier played by Joe Pesci. He worked throughout the 1990s in the New York independent film industry, especially as a regular in Spike Lee's movies, appearing in Jungle Fever (1991), Malcolm X (1992), Clockers (1995), Girl 6 (1996) and Summer of Sam (1999), generally playing working-class Italian-Americans from the \"outer boroughs.\" While rooted in the New York movie scene, Imperioli also worked in Hollywood in the mid-'90s, in the formulaic movies Bad Boys (1995) and Last Man Standing (1996). In 1999, Imperioli was cast in The Sopranos (1999) as Christopher Moltisanti, a low-ranking soldier in the Soprano crime organization whose family connections to street boss Tony Soprano move him up the ladder in the organization. Imperioli's multi-layered portrayal of such an unappealing character is a real highlight of the series and earned him an Emmy and a SAG award. Imperioli has long been active in the New York theater scene as well, having written, directed, produced or starred in numerous plays. He was a founder, along with Lili Taylor (his then-girlfriend and co-star in Household Saints (1993)) of the downtown theater company Machine Full. He has also written several episodes of \"The Sopranos\" and was a writer on Lee's \"Summer of Sam,\" which he also executive-produced. Although most famous for his prominent part in \"The Sopranos,\" Imperioli has worked on other television programs as well, including Law & Order (1990), New York Undercover (1994) and NYPD Blue (1993). He is married and has two children and one stepdaughter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1Nzk2MDg2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk4NzQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0408284","name":"Michael Imperioli","idIMDB":"nm0408284"},"actorId":"nm0408284","character":"Michael Todd","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0419071","main":true},{"actorName":"Alejandra Prado","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0695005","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"Teresa Alejandra Prado Guerrero","height":"5' 7¾\" (1.72 m)","bio":"Alejandra Prado was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico as Teresa Alejandra Prado Guerrero.
