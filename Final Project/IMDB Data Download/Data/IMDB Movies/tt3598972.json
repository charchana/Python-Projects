In the early 1960s, the BBC interviewed 280 eye-witnesses of the First World War for the landmark series, 'The Great War'. But only a tiny fraction of the recorded interviews made it to air. The film negatives were preserved by the Imperial War Museum and fifty years after they were filmed, this documentary presents a selection of the original interview material. Most of it has never been broadcast before. The film is a tribute to the human face of war - from the horrors of artillery bombardment and the anguish of young men forced to become killers, to fleeting outbreaks of peace on the battlefield, and the heart-breaking stories of the women on the home front who feared for those closest to them.","simplePlot":"In the early 1960s, the BBC interviewed 280 eye-witnesses of the First World War for the series, 'The Great War'.
