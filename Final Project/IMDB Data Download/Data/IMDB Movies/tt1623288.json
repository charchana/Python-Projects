Influenced by the comedians of his childhood (such as Richard Pryor, Woody Allen, and Shelley Berman), Garlin enjoys telling stories, exploring his personal foibles and exposing his innermost thoughts for all to hear. Garlin both co-stars and executive produces the critically acclaimed HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000). The unique comedy, which is one of the rare television shows to become part of the national zeitgeist, stars Seinfeld (1989) creator Larry David with Garlin portraying his loyal manager. The series recently won the Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy, The Danny Thomas Producer of the Year Award from the Producers Guild of America and the AFI comedy series of the year award. Previously, Garlin was a series regular for three seasons on Mad About You (1992) in the role of Marvin. He also had his own self titled half hour special on HBO. Born and raised in Chicago and then South Florida, Garlin studied filmmaking and began performing stand-up comedy while at the University of Miami. He has toured the country as a stand-up comedian, is an alumnus of Chicago's Second City Theatre, and has written and starred in three critically acclaimed solo shows (\"I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With,\" \"Uncomplicated\" and \"Concentrated\"). As a director he has directed Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000) and both Jon Stewart (\"Unleavened\") and Denis Leary (\"Lock-n-Load\") in their HBO specials.

Having stolen so many moments on stage that she could be convicted of grand larceny, this tough old broad broaching 80 with the still-shapely legs, puffy blonde hairdo and deep, whiskey voice isn't quitting anytime soon - or so it seems. Born in Detroit in 1925 and educated at a finishing school, she prepared for the stage at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School and made her debut in 1944. She made it to Broadway two years later and has since become the toast of both Broadway and London's West End, collecting a number of trophies on both continents over the years for such award-winning turns as \"Bus Stop\", \"Sail Away\", \"A Delicate Balance\", \"Show Boat\" and \"Company\". Through sheer personality alone, her cacophonous singing voice has miraculously taken classic songs from Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart to Noël Coward and Stephen Sondheim and put her indelible stamp on them. She was a supporting player in several films, including A Farewell to Arms (1957) with Rock Hudson and Jennifer Jones, and dabbled on comedy TV, with the series My Sister Eileen (1960), but never made a strong name for herself in either of those mediums. In the early 1970's she married English actor John Bay and moved to London. She scored first on stage, then on TV with Donald Sinden in Two's Company (1975). Returning to America alone, she offered sly, abrasive cameos in both sitcoms and dramatic features. At age 76 Elaine is still throwing out zingers on stage and recently copped the Tony, Drama Desk, Obie, Outer Circle Critics and New York Drama Critics awards for her candid one-woman musical memoir Elaine Stritch at Liberty (2002). The show chronicles her notorious private life, which included a long bout with the bottle (to curb her stage fright) and a destructive relationship with fellow alcoholic Gig Young. Add to that a fair share of Hollywood gossip all cleverly packaged up with a still razor-sharp wit and show-stopping patter songs and you have what Elaine Stritch is all about. Truly one of a kind.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyOTIyNTc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMTMyMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834626","name":"Elaine Stritch","idIMDB":"nm0834626"},"actorId":"nm0834626","character":"Grandma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0325034","main":true},{"actorName":"Bernard Hill","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0384060","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTI3MzE1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODgzMDk1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 December 1944","placeOfBirth":" Manchester, England, UK","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Bernard Hill was born on December 17, 1944 in Manchester, England.

He began his professional career as a member of Boston's seminal improvisational company \"The Proposition\". It was in his last year at \"The Proposition\" that a Paramount casting director spotted him and put him in the Emmy award- winning television film The Defection of Simas Kudirka (1978) with Alan Arkin. Soon, Jack moved to New York City, but didn't stay long. After another TV movie, Women at West Point (1979) with Linda Purl, Jack moved to Los Angeles. After two years of episodic television, a Roger Corman film, and the infamous Heaven's Gate (1980), Jack landed his first television series. It was a half-hour from Disney TV for CBS called Small & Frye (1983). Darren McGavin played \"Nick Small\" and Jack played \"Chip Frye\". Besides Small & Frye (1983), Jack has starred in several other series. With George C. Scott, Jack starred in the Fox series Mr. President (1987) and in what is probably his most visible role, Jack played \"MacGillicuddy\" in the last two seasons of the television classic Moonlighting (1985). Jack also played \"Mr. Donner\" in the Téa Leoni series The Naked Truth (1995) and \"Jack Powers\" on George Lopez (2002). His roles in episodic TV number more than 100 and have included performances in some of television's landmark shows, including M*A*S*H (1972), China Beach (1988), Thirtysomething (1987), Roseanne (1988), Northern Exposure (1990), NYPD Blue (1993), the The X-Files (1993) and \"CSI\" (2010)_. Jack has starred in numerous films for TV including LBJ: The Early Years (1987) with Randy Quaid, Amos (1985) with Kirk Douglas, Joshua's Heart (1990) with Melissa Gilbert, and the HBO film The Last of His Tribe (1992) with Graham Green and Jon Voight. Besides his on camera work, Jack has lent his voice to over 3000 movies and television shows. He lives in Chatsworth, California, with his wife Lora. They have two sons, Ian and Christopher.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNjY2NzQ1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg3NTI2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088269","name":"Jack
