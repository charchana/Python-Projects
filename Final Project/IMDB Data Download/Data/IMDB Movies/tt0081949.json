His interest in acting began during his school years, when he took part in many amateur productions. This led to him being spotted by the BBC, and that led to work in such radio shows such as \"Children's Hour\" followed. However, by age 15 he left school and went to work for Rolls-Royce. However, when some film producers were looking for a young Scot for a role in The Foreman Went to France (1942), \"The Beeb\" hadn't forgotten Gordon (even if he had forgotten them) and recommended him. His abilities as an actor really came to the forefront at age 20 with his appearance as an airman in Millions Like Us (1943). Although his roles were limited by his Scottish accent, his versatility won him many film and TV roles in a career spanning almost 50 years. He was a very prolific actor and, although not always starring in high-profile films, he was rarely out of work. His early career also included work in radio and repertory theater in Glasgow, Worthing and Perth. He made his London stage debut in 1951, in the long-running farce \"Seagulls Over Sorrento\". Later stage roles included Horatio in \"Hamlet\", Banquo in \"Macbeth\", Ishmael in \"Moby Dick\" directed by Orson Welles and a range of other parts both classical and modern. In 1949 he starred in the film Floodtide (1949) alongside Rona Anderson, whom he married two years later. The couple had two children, Graham and Roddy. His film work remained steady throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In 1969 he played Horatio in Tony Richardson's production of \"Hamlet\" at the Round House, and won the Clarence Derwent Award for Best Supporting Actor. However, the public didn't really \"discover\" him until 1971 with London Weekend Television's classic Upstairs, Downstairs (1971). This series set in the 1910s and 1920s concerned the contrast between the lives of a wealthy family (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs). He played the \"middleman\" butler, Hudson. The series lasted five years and aired in dozens of countries worldwide, and was particularly popular in the US. In 1974 he was awarded British Actor of the Year award and a Supporting Actor Emmy in 1975 for \"Upstairs, Downstair\". In 1977 came the long-running The Professionals (1977), an action-based crime series in which he played the tough, ruthless, wily head of a government agency called Criminal Intelligence (essentially a cross between MI6, Special Branch and the SAS). This was a complete (if temporary) change of direction for his career and he appeared to relish the challenge of playing an entirely different role. Despite the controversial depiction of violence, the series was hugely successful all over the world (except America, as the TV network executives there felt it too violent). Reportedly the British royal family were fans of the series, and in 1979 he was awarded OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) for his services to drama. Shortly after completion of the series in 1981, he appeared in the Australian mini-series A Town Like Alice (1981).. He won Australia's Logie award for this role. Yet despite his success, he claimed that he did not enjoy his own performances and never watched himself on screen, stating that he never felt very confident or comfortable in front of the camera or on stage. Throughout the remainder of the 1980s he generally took small roles in TV and film projects. Tragically his career was cut short when, in 1989, it was discovered he had irreversible bone cancer. He passed away on 14 January 1990 at the Cromwell Hospital in South Kensington, London.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg1NDA3NjgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAzNzQwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413561","name":"Gordon Jackson","idIMDB":"nm0413561"},"actorId":"nm0413561","character":" Noel Strachan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0536563","main":true},{"actorName":"Dorothy Alison","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019704","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjdiOTZlZDYtMjNjMS00ZTEwLWI4ZmYtY2QxMWY3YWFkODUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 April 1925","placeOfBirth":" Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Dorothy Dickson","bio":"Dorothy Alison was born on April 4, 1925 in Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia as Dorothy Dickson.

Lewis was born and raised in South Eastern Arnhem Land, Northern Territory amongst the Murrungun tribe where today their lands are federally protected. For much of his early life he worked as a bricklayer and stockman in order to make ends meet. However this was only a front for his real drive and ambition to pursue a life of artistic merit. Most notably, Tom has shown his talents in both the musical and theatrical arena. He has worked with many renowned theatrical companies such as Playbox and Melbourne Theatre Company and has produced internationally recognised work. But the real success story for Tom was his transition from theatre into film earning his first breakthrough role as the title character in the film \"Chant Of Jimmie Blacksmith\" (1978); a film which won itself a Palme d'Or nomination no less at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. Tom's film career has been as broad as at has been long with him playing a multitude of complex, realistic and mostly recognisable indigenous characters. One of his most noticeable characters included Two Bob, an outlaw in the commercially and critically successful \"The Proposition\" (2005) and Jimmy Conway in the film \"Red Hill\" (2010) in which he played the main antagonist, an escaped and extremely vengeful convict. Tom E. Lewis' acting abilities have slowly over the years begun to shine more and more on the international film circuit. With the release of his new film \"Red Hill\" (2010), which is being hailed as the next No Country for Old Men, it seems that Tom's day in the sunlight is just around the corner and perhaps even bigger character roles for him to sink his teeth into?","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDk0NTI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA3MjQwMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507835","name":"Tommy Lewis","idIMDB":"nm0507835"},"actorId":"nm0507835","character":" Bourneville","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0536571","main":true},{"actorName":"Syd Heylen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382256","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1922","placeOfBirth":" Renmark, South Australia, Australia","birthName":"Harold Charles Sydney Heylen","bio":"At 16, he joined the Army, eventually serving on the Kokoda Trail in the 39th Infantry during WW2.

In 1948, she made her acting debut on ABC Radio Adelaide. At 23, she left Australia for the UK to pursue an acting career and further stage training, but found the competition so great that she ended up working for Kellogg's, and soon returned. Unfortunately, her life was plagued with ill health, and she suffered a heart attack in 1979; underwent heart operations in 1982 and '83. Further complications were stomach cancer and kidney problems in 1996, and a major hip operation. She made her name on TV in 'Sons and Daughters', 'Prisoner' and 'Playschool', and of course on the stage. Without doubt her greatest contribution to acting was her portrayal of Helen Daniels - glamorous mother-in-law, grandmother and great-grandmother, and Grundy TV's 'Neighbours' matriarch. From the show's inception in 1985, she played an intelligent and sympathetic character with whom every other character was able to talk and discuss their problems. Haddy saw cast members come and go, becoming the longest-serving member of the cast in 1993 after the departure of Alan Dale. She was also able to enjoy working with her real-life husband James Condon, who played the guest parts of both Douglas Blake and Reuben White on the show. Her character's life often mirrored her own, with Helen suffering ill health throughout the 12 years of her time on the show. In 1997, Haddy's poor health forced her to take time off from the show. When doctors told her that she had narrowly avoided death from stomach cancer that year, she made the difficult decision to quit, and Helen Daniels died peacefully with her family around her in Episode 2,965 in October 1997. Sadly, Anne continued to experience ill health, and died peacefully with her husband beside her in a Melbourne hospital in July 1999. She had five children and six grandchildren.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352760","name":"Anne Haddy","idIMDB":"nm0352760"},"actorId":"nm0352760","character":" Aggie Topp","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[{"yearSeason":1981,"episodes":[{"episode":1,"title":"Episode #1.1","date":"4 Oct. 1981","plot":"Know what this is about?
