After that he was hooked and wormed his way into every show he could until graduation. He managed to acquire a few awards along the way including a Best Male Performance Award in for his role as \"The Most Evil Man in Washington Courthouse Ohio\" in Live Spelled Backwards at the ABCI One Act Festival in Saskatchewan and the Most Promising Acting Talent Award from the University Hill Drama Department for his work as \"Cliff\" in The Woolgatherer. After his graduation he spent the summer as part of the now defunct Impulse Theatre Society that culminated with his first Fringe Festival appearance as \"Pere Ubu\" in Ubu Roi. This naturally led to a decision to study sound engineering at Columbia Academy and Simon dropped out of the acting scene to pursue a career in the music industry. After graduating from Columbia he was hired as the Jr. A&R Assistant at Nettwerk Records; a position that afforded him an opportunity to wear many hats, including audio editor, archivist, demo tape adjudicator, sound engineer, road crew, studio manager, special event organizer, and won him one gold and two platinum albums that although he doesn't necessarily feel he really earned he'll still hang on his wall none the less. When Simon left Nettwerk, he briefly managed his own label prior to his band Speedbuggy, signing with Squirtgun Records in Toronto. Two albums and two cross country tours later he had had enough of the music industry and found himself with nothing to do. It was at this point Simon reconnected with his brother Desmond Hussey who had just graduated from the Capilano College theatre program and along with Des, set designer Blake Drezet, and fellow Impulse Theatre member Justin Clow, formed Spectral Theatre Society. In the 12 plus years since its formation, Simon has authored over a dozen scripts and directed and produced as many more. More recently, Simon has authored scripts for the VanArts Full-Time Acting class' final film projects, and had one of his previously written stage plays adapted by the Department of Film and Theatre at UBC for their term end project as well. As of October of 2014, Simon has been involved with producing Spectral Theatre's monthly presentation of Late-Night Double Feature at Skinny Fat Jack's on Main Street in Vancouver.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNjM2MTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU5NjIyNTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2318823","name":"Simon C.
