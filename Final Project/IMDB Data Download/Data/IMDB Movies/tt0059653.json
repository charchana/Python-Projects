Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received Oscar nomination in every decade from the 1960s through the early 2000s. Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937 in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a showgirl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian-American showman, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show-business. Jack's mother's ancestry was Irish, English, as well as German, Scottish and Welsh. Nicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including The Little Shop of Horrors (1960). Nicholson's first turn in the director's chair was for Drive, He Said (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for The Trip (1967), and co-wrote Head (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Easy Rider (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson's film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Five Easy Pieces (1970). Nicholson's other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski's noir masterpiece Chinatown (1974) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar. The 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel The Shining (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including Terms of Endearment (1983) which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; Prizzi's Honor (1985) and The Witches of Eastwick (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton's Batman (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as A Few Good Men (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Mars Attacks! (1996). Although a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson's acting range reappeared in The Departed (2006), the actor's most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets (1997), for which he won his third Oscar. Shades of this persona are apparent in About Schmidt (2002), Something's Gotta Give (2003) and The Bucket List (2007). In addition to his Academy Awards and Oscar nominations, Nicholson has seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. He also became one of the youngest actors to receive the American Film Institute's Life Achievement award in 1994. Nicholson has five children: Eldest daughter Jennifer Nicholson (b. 1963), from his marriage to Sandra Knight which ended in 1968; Caleb James Goddard (b. 1970) with Susan Anspach; Honey Hollman (b. 1981) with Danish supermodel, Winnie Hollman; and Lorraine Nicholson (b. 1990) and Ray Nicholson (b. 1992) with Rebecca Broussard. Nicholson's longest relationship was the seventeen years he spent with actress Anjelica Huston; this ended when Broussard become pregnant with his child.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3OTY0ODk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzE4Njc4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197","name":"Jack Nicholson","nicknames":["Mulholland Man","Nick"],"idIMDB":"nm0000197"},"actorId":"nm0000197","character":"Wes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0161766","main":true},{"actorName":"Katherine Squire","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0820096","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 March 1903","placeOfBirth":" Defiance, Ohio, USA","bio":"Katherine Squire was born on March 9, 1903 in Defiance, Ohio, USA.

Stanton was born in West Irvine, Kentucky, to Ersel (Moberly), a cook, and Sheridan Harry Stanton, a barber and tobacco farmer. Stanton served as a cook in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and was on board an LST during the Battle of Okinawa. He then returned to the University of Kentucky to appear in a production of \"Pygmalion\", before heading out to California and honing his craft at the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse. Stanton then toured around the United States with a male choir, worked in children's theater, and then headed back to California. His first role on screen was in the tepid movie Tomahawk Trail (1957), but he was quickly noticed and appeared regularly in minor roles as cowboys and soldiers through the late 1950s and early 1960s. His star continued to rise and he received better roles in which he could showcase his laid-back style, such as in Cool Hand Luke (1967), Kelly's Heroes (1970), Dillinger (1973), The Godfather: Part II (1974), and in Alien (1979). It was around this time that Stanton came to the attention of director Wim Wenders, who cast him in his finest role yet as Travis in the moving Paris, Texas (1984). Next indie director Alex Cox gave Stanton a role that really brought him to the forefront, in the quirky cult film Repo Man (1984). Stanton was now heavily in demand, and his unique look got him cast as everything from a suburban father in the mainstream Pretty in Pink (1986) to a soft-hearted, but ill-fated, private investigator in Wild at Heart (1990) and a crazy yet cunning scientist in Escape from New York (1981). Apart from his film performances, Stanton is also an accomplished musician, and \"The Harry Dean Stanton Band\" and their unique spin on mariachi music have been playing together for well over a decade. They have toured internationally to rave reviews. Stanton became a cult figure of cinema and music and when Debbie Harry sang the lyric \"I want to dance with Harry Dean...\" in her 1990s hit \"I Want That Man\", she was talking about him. As he moved into the time in his life when most other people would be calling it a day, Harry Dean Stanton has remained consistently active on screen, most recently appearing in films including Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), The Green Mile (1999) and The Man Who Cried (2000). A true gem amongst character actors, and with an on screen presence capable of adding that something extra to any production.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDYyMTQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjU2NjE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001765","name":"Harry Dean Stanton","idIMDB":"nm0001765"},"actorId":"nm0001765","character":"Blind Dick","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027395","main":true},{"actorName":"John Hackett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352467","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"John Hackett is known for his work on Tales of Terror (1962), Blood and Wine (1996) and The Two Jakes (1990).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352467","name":"John Hackett","idIMDB":"nm0352467"},"actorId":"nm0352467","character":"Winslow","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tom Filer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276869","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tom Filer (1925-2013) was an actor, screenwriter and novelist.

Filer worked as a screenwriter and actor with Jack Nicholson, Monte Hellman (\"Ride in the Whirlwind\") and Roger Corman, supplementing his income with lobster diving and albacore fishing. Filer taught writing at UCLA Extension, and held workshops in his home.
