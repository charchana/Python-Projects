While attending the University of St. Thomas in Houston, he saw a beautiful girl leaving a building on campus every Monday and decided to drop an English class and sign up for \"whatever the hell they were teaching in that building\". The building was the University's theater department, and the class was acting. Through his theater studies, he penned a piece of children's theater and decided afterwards to pack up his car and head to Los Angeles with the hopes of actually producing the play. Somewhere in the process, an agent approached him and requested to represent him commercially. His first paid role in Hollywood was a Kellog's Corn Pops commercial starring alongside none other than Paul Walker. Shortly after a string of national commercials, the same agent then began representing him for TV/film roles. He very quickly landed the title role in George Lucas' \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" after shooting 2 films for the Mickey Mouse Club called \"Just Perfect\" and \"My Life As A Babysitter\". Since then, Flanery has been in numerous films and TV shows every year, including \"Powder\", \"The Dead Zone\", \"SAW3D\", \"Suicide Kings\", and the runaway cult hit \"The Boondock Saints\", and most recently, the TV show \"Powers\" for Sony, which is scheduled to be released in early 2015. Flanery is also noted for winning the Toyota celebrity race of Long Beach two years in a row, the first as an amateur, and the second after being invited back to compete as a pro. He won after qualifying on the pole both times. Off camera, Flanery is a high ranking martial artist having earned his black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu from the Renzo Gracie lineage on May 4th of 2008. He owns his own BJJ academy called Hollywood Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in West Hollywood, Ca. where he trains regularly when his film schedule allows.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM3NjA5MDcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYyNTQ5MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001218","name":"Sean Patrick Flanery","idIMDB":"nm0001218"},"actorId":"nm0001218","character":"Connor MacManus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0080309","main":true},{"actorName":"Norman Reedus","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005342","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODE4NTgzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI0MjAwMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 January 1969","placeOfBirth":" Hollywood, Florida, USA","birthName":"Norman Mark Reedus","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Norman Reedus was born in Hollywood, Florida, to Marianne (Yarber), a teacher, and Norman Reedus.

He also starred opposite Flanery in the 2009 sequel The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day (2009). He appeared at the 2012 Comic-Con in San Diego. As of 2010 he stars as Daryl Dixon in the AMC television series The Walking Dead (2010). The character was not originally in the comic book series of the same name, but was created specifically for Reedus after his audition for the character of Merle Dixon. The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman has stated he feels \"absolutely blessed [Reedus] has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A lot of Norman's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season.

Born in Framingham MA, Brian moved with his family to Illinois and Ohio before settling in a beautiful small town in Western Michigan. Unable to afford theater training after high school and in the middle of the Iranian hostage crisis he joined the US Army in hopes of later attending American Academy of Dramatic Arts in NYC. The Army had different plans for Brian and after 2 yrs of infantry training, accepted him into US Army flight school at Ft Rucker, Alabama. Brian loved the intense academic environment and found he had a natural ability flying helicopters. Upon flight school graduation, Brian was accepted into the attack school where he was trained as a Cobra pilot then sent to a discreet Army base in the rural fields west of Nurnberg, Germany. The only American living in the small town of Oberntief at the time, Brian treasures those years and is always trying to live up to them. While in Germany, he studied full time at the satellite campus of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University near Nurnberg, and as an avid skier, racked up over fifty lift tickets in three years from the Austrian Alps to the Italian Dolomites. If he wasn't flying, studying, or comparing stories over drinks at their remote officers club, he was traveling Europe with his fellow gun pilots. Despite an exciting and very rewarding career thus far, Brian knew it was time to become an actor soon and after seeing the movie Top Gun in Garmisch, requested his final assignment be as close to Hollywood as possible. Within a year, he was based at Ft Ord, CA and immersed himself in Monterey's busy theater community whenever he could. In Monterey, he got the part of Vince in Buried Child by falling down 'drunk' on stage during his audition and completing the scene from the stage floor. In late 1989, after 10 years of military service, Brian resigned from the Army, sold his new Saab for acting lessons in Hollywood, and made his move there. October 30th 2009 marks both the theatrical release of the new film Boondock Saints 2, All Saints Day and the 20th anniversary of Brian's arrival in Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537126","name":"Brian Mahoney","idIMDB":"nm0537126"},"actorId":"nm0537126","character":"Detective Duffy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0006580","main":true},{"actorName":"Bob Marley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0549125","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0ODEyNDAwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ0NTEyMjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Robert Cochrane Marley Jr.","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Bob Marley was born in Portland, Maine, USA as Robert Cochrane Marley Jr. He is a writer and actor, known for The Boondock Saints (1999), The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day (2009) and Worldwide!
