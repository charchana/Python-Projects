McCallum","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564726","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, David L. McCallum grew up being mistaken for one of TV's \"Men from U.N.C.L.E.\" - a Scotland-born actor with the same first and last name - which is why he uses his middle initial. Though a mischievous mimic in his youth, he did not catch the acting bug until his late 20's, studying and later performing in plays at the Ottawa Little Theatre, and taking numerous acting workshops in Toronto, Kingston, and Ottawa. He also developed improvisational skills through roles in murder mystery dinner theatre. In the mid-eighties, Dave began his on-screen career with a supporting role in a low-budget film entitled REBEL HIGH, filmed in Montreal, and made a guest appearance on the television series DENIM BLUES, an Ottawa production for the CTV television network. Seven years of voice lessons yielded a major reward in 1998: the lead role of \"The Judge\" in Gilbert and Sullivan's TRIAL BY JURY, a musical theatre production for Ottawa's Savoy Society. Later that year came a recurring lead role in The Comedy Network's BUTCH PATTERSON: PRIVATE DICK, playing crime boss Tommy Rubella - a role he reprised for the second series of BUTCH, recently filmed in Ottawa. He also played a supporting role in the feature film UNDERCOVER ANGEL, starring Jazmine Bleeth. In the past year, David has played leading roles in two television commercials, five corporate training videos, and has provided over 20 character voices for KEVIN SPENCER (another Comedy Network series), and for three CD-ROM games. David Is currently voicing 10 characters for the North American version of BUDGIE, THE LITTLE HELICOPTER, based on the children's books by Sarah Ferguson. David is currently based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564726","name":"David L.
