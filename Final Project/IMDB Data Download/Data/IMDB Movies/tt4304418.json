In May 4, 1991, when she was nearly four years old, she made headlines as a battered child. Her assailant was her stepfather, who burned her skin with cigarette butts and whacked her back with a flat iron. Her mother, who was then in Dubai working as a domestic helper, immediately came home. She came not to take care of her daughter, however, but to bail out her partner, who was in detention. Her mother migrated to London and had her own family. Jennylyn's aunt, Lydia Mercado, legally adopted her. In June 2004, Jennylyn's biological father, Noli Pineda, now 50, came home for a holiday. His arrival did not go unnoticed by the press. Reports came out saying that he was asking for money from his now self-sufficient daughter (an accusation she has strongly denied, insisting that her father wanted her to use his surname Pineda). She and her biological father, who is based in Korea, keep in touch. Jennylyn is now the official spokesperson of the Bata Foundation (Christian Mission Services), a non-governmental organization. It operates with basic funding support from its partner organization, Christlicher Missionsdienst (CMD) headquartered in Germany, supplementary assistance from two Japanese organizations and a few local groups, with the help of Feed Hungry Inc. and the GMA Artist Center. School Jennylyn was a senior at the Augustinian Abbey in Las Piñas, where she actively took part in school programs, from Prep to 4th year High School. Because of her hectic work schedule after winning Starstruck, she had to take a leave from school. If given the time and opportunity to pursue her studies further, the young actress has said that she'd like to take up Mass Communications as a major. In a more recent interview though, she mentioned Interior Design as her preference. Starstruck StarStruck is the first reality-based talent search on Philippine television in recent history. Its pilot episode aired on October 27, 2003. Out of thousands who auditioned for a stab at stardom, only 100 were chosen for the first cut. From 100, it was trimmed down to 60, from 60 to 30 and from 30 to the 14 finalists. Needless to say, Jennylyn made the cut. The final fourteen underwent various workshops and training in order to develop their personalities, talents, etc. But, the twist was that every week, one of the Final 14 will have to say goodbye until only four remain. The winner was announced on a two-hour TV special dubbed StarStruck Final Judgement held on February 1, 2004. Araneta Coliseum, the venue of the event was jampacked by thousands of StarStruck fans and supporters. Mark Herras and Jennylyn Mercado were proclaimed Ultimate Survivors and each of them received one million pesos plus exclusive contracts from GMA Network. The Final Judgment rated 42.8%, impressively high for a late Sunday night telecast. Because of the StarStruck fever, GMA Network created a new show, Stage 1: The StarStruck Playhouse. The StarStruck test continues on this show where the Final 14 have to prove their staying power in the business. Every week from Mondays to Thursdays, the show presents a miniseries starring the starstruck 1 final 14, this time their acting prowess is put into test. The show already went off the air with high ratings. Fridays would serve as critical day because the audience will judge their performance for the week through text messaging. An acting award is also given to the survivor who excelled in that week. Stage 1: LIVE! is also somewhat a variety show for the Survivors. If Mondays to Thursdays, they showed their acting skills, during Fridays, they are able to show their dancing, singing and hosting prowess. The show was hosted by Chynna Ortaleza and Cogie Domingo with Raymond Gutierrez. The show already went off the air with high ratings.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjEwMGQwYmUtM2I0NC00NTRkLWFkNDMtN2VkYWI4NTFiNTU5L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI5NjIyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1717582","name":"Jennylyn Mercado","idIMDB":"nm1717582"},"actorId":"nm1717582","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kean Cipriano","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2528259","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kean Cipriano is an actor, known for The Woman in the Septic Tank (2011), English Only, Please (2014) and Ang babae sa septic tank 2: #ForeverIsNotEnough (2016).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2528259","name":"Kean Cipriano","idIMDB":"nm2528259"},"actorId":"nm2528259","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cai Cortez","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3669133","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWU4M2Y2Y2QtMmE0MC00ZTc5LTg4NTQtOTA5NTYwOGM0NDcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI5NjIyMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Carissa Cortez","bio":"Cai Cortez was born as Carissa Cortez.
