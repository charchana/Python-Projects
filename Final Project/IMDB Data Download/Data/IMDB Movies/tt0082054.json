The third of six children born to actress Mado Maurin (1915-2011), his mothere made acting a family affair. All of his siblings -- Jean-Pierre Maurin (1941-1996), Yves-Marie Maurin (1944-2009), Dominique Maurin (1949- ), 'Jean-Francois Maurin' (1957- ) and 'Marie-Veronique Maurin' (1960- ) -- all became thespians. Patrick made his film debut at the age of four under the name Patrick Maurin in Amazing Monsieur Fabre (1951). While growing up, he was taunted by his schoolyard friends for his young film endeavors, he learned sensitivity and isolation at an early age. Other films during this adolescent period of time included his playing an unbilled child role in Gene Kelly's La route joyeuse (1957). As a young adult in the early 1960s Patrick appeared on French television, then joined the \"Café de Gare\" theatrical troupe in 1968 where he remained for nearly a decade. It was during these stage years that he changed his stage name to Dewaere, the maiden name of his great grandmother. He also met and became romantically involvement with fellow troupe member Miou-Miou. A child, Angele, was born to this liaison in 1974, but the couple broke up after only two years. Another daughter, Lola, was born in the early 1980s from a later marriage. After numerous film bits, stardom was finally his with the leading rebel-like role of Pierrot in Bertrand Blier's anarchic comedy Going Places (1974) [Going Places], which also starred up-and-coming actor Gérard Depardieu and lady love Miou-Miou. He and Depardieu earned instant \"anti-hero\" stardom in this tale of two wanderlust petty thugs. Patrick's genius for dark, offbeat comedy was apparent in the number of black comedies that came his way. Catherine & Co. (1975) [Catherine & Co.] co-starred Patrick with Jane Birkin, a social commentary on the prostitution business. He followed this with the crime drama The French Detective (1975) [The French Detective] as Lino Ventura's inspector sidekick. Dewaere earned high marks for his off-balanced role in La meilleure façon de marcher (1976) [The Best Way], then paired up again with Depardieu in the Oscar-winning cross-over comedy Get Out Your Handkerchiefs (1978) [Get Out Your Handkerchiefs]. Infinitely more interested in searching out complex roles than fame, his work in films were more often than not experimental, lowbudget and quirky in style. He appeared innately drawn to playing sensitive, scruffy, miserable neurotics, misfits and losers, as exemplified by his characters in Coup de tete (1979)_ [Hothead], Série noire (1979), Heat of Desire (1981) [Heat of Desire], Hôtel des Amériques (1981) [Hotel America] which co-starred Catherine Deneuve, and the critically-acclaimed Beau Pere (1981). This obsesssion may have triggered a deep and profound suffering in his own off-screen personal life. Unlike his counterpart Depardieu, Patrick's fame never branched out internationally, but he was recognized consistently throughout Europe for his superlative portrayals. Amazingly, he was nominated for seven César awards (the French equivalent of the \"Oscar\") but never won. Patrick's career ended in tragic and still mysterious circumstances. Shortly after the release of the film Paradis pour tous (1982) [Paradise for All], a dark comedy in which his character commits suicide, the 35-year-old actor decided to end his own life by shooting himself with a rifle in a Paris hotel on July 16, 1982. At the time he was working on the Claude Lelouch's film Edith and Marcel (1983). A shocking, inexplicable end to friends, fans and family alike, Dewaere later became the subject of a full-length French documentary Patrick Dewaere (1992), which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. The Patrick Dewaere Award was established in France in 1983.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwOTM1MDQzMzheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU1NDkyMDkx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223033","name":"Patrick Dewaere","idIMDB":"nm0223033"},"actorId":"nm0223033","character":"Rémi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ariel Besse","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0078769","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" France","bio":"Ariel Besse was born on November 14, 1965 in France.
