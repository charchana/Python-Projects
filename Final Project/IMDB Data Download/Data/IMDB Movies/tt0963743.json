Perhaps Liam's most memorable performance to date has been in the Polish/American feature film Edges of the Lord (2001) alongside Willem Dafoe and Haley Joel Osment, where he gives a moving and unforgettable performance (with a convincing Polish accent) playing the complex Polish peasant boy, \"Tolo\".
