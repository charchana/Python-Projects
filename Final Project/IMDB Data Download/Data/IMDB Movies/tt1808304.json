He is the son of Joan Mavis Felton (Bradford) and Jean Henri Dourif, a French-born art collector who owned and operated a dye factory. His father died when Dourif was three years old, after which his mother married Bill Campbell, a champion golfer, who helped raise Brad, his brother, and his four sisters. From 1963 to 1965, Dourif attended Aiken Preparatory School in Aiken, South Carolina, where he pursued his interests in art and acting. Although he briefly considered becoming a professional artist, he finally settled on acting as a profession, inspired by his mother's participation as an actress in community theater. Starting in school productions, he progressed to community theater, joining up with the Huntington Community Players, while attending Marshall University of Huntington. At age 19, he quit his hometown college and headed to New York City, where he worked with the Circle Repertory Company. During the early 1970s, Dourif appeared in a number of plays, off-Broadway and at Woodstock, New York, including Milos Forman who cast him in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Although this film is frequently cited as his film debut, in fact, Dourif made his first big-screen appearance with a bit part in W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975). Nevertheless, his portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in Forman's film was undoubtedly his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Acting Debut, a British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Skeptical of his instant stardom, Dourif returned to New York, where he continued in theater and taught acting and directing classes at Columbia University until 1988 when he moved to Hollywood. Despite his attempts to avoid typecasting, his intensity destined him to play demented, deranged, or disturbed characters, starting in Eyes of Laura Mars (1978), John Huston's Wise Blood (1979) (arguably his best performance to date), and Milos Forman's Ragtime (1981). Dourif then teamed up with director David Lynch for Dune (1984) and Blue Velvet (1986). His high-strung style also served him well in a number of horror films, notably as the voice of the evil doll Chucky in Child's Play (1988) and its sequels. Dourif broke from the horror genre with roles in Fatal Beauty (1987), Mississippi Burning (1988), Hidden Agenda (1990), and London Kills Me (1991). Recent film work includes the role of Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Since his television debut in the PBS film The Mound Builders (1976), Dourif has made sporadic appearances in a number of television series, such as The X-Files (1993), Babylon 5 (1994), Star Trek: Voyager (1995) and Ponderosa (2001) (in the recurring role of Frenchy).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNTA2MDExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE0MDAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000374","name":"Brad Dourif","idIMDB":"nm0000374"},"actorId":"nm0000374","character":"Jacob Capilla","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"J.D.

He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others. After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play \"Dylan's Ghost\" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_. Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist's print worth $80.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTMwMTQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjgyMjc4OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0263625","name":"J.D.

He began his illustrious acting career at the tender age of 9 when he made the local paper by winning the 5th grade talent show lip syncing to Steve Martin's \"King Tut.\" At the age of 13, Bryan showed an interest in cartooning and filmmaking, so his Dad bought him a Super 8mm camera. Recruiting the neighborhood and his family, Bryan would spend his weekend's shooting comedic action shorts with his beloved camera. During high school, Bryan dropped out of football because it conflicted with his theater schedule. In college, Bryan had lead roles in several musicals, participated in community theater, made several short movies with his buddies on campus, and was a nationally ranked member of the cheer-leading squad. After earning an Associate's Degree in Radio/Television, Bryan decided to pursue his acting career and moved to Hollywood, where he got his SAG card playing a Nazi on the X-Files. After spending 4 years in Los Angeles Bryan returned home to Texas, working in local improvisation troupes and continuing to write his own projects. With no local agent he would later go on to get a stint on Prison Break, only after crashing the audition! He quickly went on to sign with a local agent and due to his unique gruff voice, Bryan was able to participate in his love of cartoons by doing voice over work for many anime shows and video games. Bryan has booked several commercials and acted in many short films and independents. Bryan has also been able to go onto more prolific roles including playing Detective Brinkley, a cop in hot pursuit of Diane Keaton and Ted Danson in \"Mad Money\", as Skeeter, an oil man friend to Josh Brolin's portrayal of George W. Bush in Oliver Stones critically acclaimed \"W\" and can also be seen in this summer's much anticipated Judd Apatow comedy \"Year One\" starring Jack Black and Michael Cera, coming to theaters June 19th.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTM3Njc2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAwNTM0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0557287","name":"Bryan Massey","nicknames":["Mass Attack"],"idIMDB":"nm0557287"},"actorId":"nm0557287","character":"Police Chief Michaels","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wallace Merck","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580467","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzMyNTI1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQzNTM1NTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Wallace Merck is an actor, known for RoboCop 2 (1990), Fried Green Tomatoes (1991) and White Lightnin' (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzMyNTI1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQzNTM1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580467","name":"Wallace Merck","idIMDB":"nm0580467"},"actorId":"nm0580467","character":"Board Member","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1808304","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1808304","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 27 min (87 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.78 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Cineworks, New Orleans (LA), USA"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Super 35 (3-perf)"],"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"3.3","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Lafayette, Louisiana, USA"}],"rated":"TV-14","awards":[],"votes":"658","type":"TV Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0236941","name":"Bullet Films"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["super volcano","volcano","military base","assassination attempt","corporate greed","cover up","water park","spring break","divorced couple","field research","field trip","extinct volcano","press conference","oil company","geologist","lava","off shore oil drilling","explosion","burned to death","burned alive","magma","destruction","oil platform","drilling rig","oil rig","usa","united states of america","united states","florida","miami florida"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 10:58:57"}}
