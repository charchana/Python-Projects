It was during these years that Michael developed his desire to act. At age fifteen, he successfully auditioned for the role of a 10-year-old in a series called Leo and Me (1978). Gaining attention as a bright new star in Canadian television and movies, Michael realized his love for acting when he appeared on stage in \"The Shadow Box\". At age 18, he moved to Los Angeles and was offered a few roles in television series but early acting success ended fast when the roles stopped coming. For a while, he survived on boxes of macaroni and cheese. Then his agent called to tell him that he got the part of Alex P. Keaton on the situation comedy Family Ties (1982).

She is the youngest of five children. Her parents are Barbara Anne (Barry) and Clifford Elwin \"Cliff\" Thompson. Since all her siblings were much older than she, Lea says it seemed like she had more than two parents. The family lived in the Starlight Motel, all the kids sharing a room. Things began to look up for the family when Lea's father got a job in Minneapolis, where the family moved. Lea's parents divorced when she was six, and her mother decided to maintain the family. This wasn't the easiest job, considering her mother was alcohol-addicted at the time. When she found the strength to quit drinking, she took a job playing the piano and singing in a bar to support Lea and her siblings. When Lea was seven, her mother remarried. Ever since Lea was little, she loved to dance -- ballet to be exact. She would practice three to four hours every day. Her first role was as a mouse in \"The Nutcracker\". After Lea turned fourteen, she had performed in more than 45 ballets on stages, such as The Minnesota Dance Theatre, The Pennsylvania Ballet Company, and The Ballet Repertory. She won scholarships to The American Ballet Theatre and The San Francisco Ballet. At age nineteen, she auditioned for Mikhail Baryshnikov, who later told her that she was \"a beautiful dancer... but too stocky\". Lea knew her dreams had been crushed. At that point, she decided to turn to acting. She began working as a waitress, also making 22 Burger King commercials and a few Twix commercials. She was perfect for these parts simply because she was the average girl-down-the-street, from the Midwest. Everyone who knows her can't believe she was and still is so completely different...trying to be independent and fight against the system. In 1982, Lea made some type of a computer game or interactive movie known as \"Murder, Anyone\". Her first role was in the movie, Jaws 3-D (1983), as a water ski bunny, although she couldn't swim or ski, which she still can't! There, she met Dennis Quaid, who became her fiancée and acting coach. Her next role was in All the Right Moves (1983), where she acted opposite Tom Cruise. Director Michael Chapman was so disappointed with her performance, that he almost fired her. Between 1983 and 1984, Lea appeared in other \"teen\" movies, such as Red Dawn (1984), The Wild Life (1984), and Going Undercover (aka Going Undercover (1985)), and believes it was lucky that, in these movies, they were able to use anyone who could walk and talk! Lea's biggest known accomplishment, and her big break, came from the first Back to the Future (1985). It was the biggest hit of 1985, and Lea was suddenly the most wanted actress. She could have her pick of any role she wanted to take on. She chose Howard the Duck (1986). Although it was a George Lucas production, the critics turned the movie, and Lea, down. Afterwards, director Howard Deutch offered Lea a part in his movie, Some Kind of Wonderful (1987), but she refused. After he urged her to do it, she reconsidered. She won the Young Artist Award for best young actress. During filming, Howard and Lea fell in love, and she called it off with Dennis. She then went on to film The Wizard of Loneliness (1988), which was her first movie as a woman, rather than a youngster. Lea went on to film Back to the Future Part II (1989) and an episode of Tales from the Crypt (1989). She then married Howard Deutch. She continued filming Back to the Future Part III (1990), Montana (1990), and Article 99 (1992). Lea then took a break to stay home with her first born, Madelyn Deutch. She jumped back into acting in Dennis the Menace (1993), where she says she just played herself. Then it was on to The Beverly Hillbillies (1993), Stolen Babies (1993), The Little Rascals (1994), and The Substitute Wife (1994). In 1994, she had her second child, Zoey Deutch. Lea then went into filming The Unspoken Truth (1995). It was then that she was first given the script of a new NBC sitcom, Caroline in the City (1995). It was probably the best decision Lea ever made. She won a People's Choice Award for best actress in a new sitcom. Unfortunately, with all of NBC's problems, Caroline in the City (1995) kept being moved to a worse and worse time slot, giving it horrible ratings. The show ended after only four seasons. Bad ideas from the creators (Julia, etc.) didn't help, either. Lea quickly went onto The Right to Remain Silent (1996), The Unknown Cyclist (1998), and A Will of Their Own (1998). She also guest-starred in the Friends (1994) episode, Friends: The One with the Baby on the Bus (1995), as \"Caroline Duffy\", and on The Larry Sanders Show (1992). Lea also did some stage work, including starring as \"Sally Bowles\" in \"Cabaret\". The show toured and also appeared on Broadway. She then did \"The Vagina Monologues\" in L.A. She had a stint in a dramatic role as a Chief Deputy Assistant District Attorney, \"Camille Paris\", on For the People (2002). Thompson has starred in more than 30 films, 25 television movies, 4 television series, more than 20 ballets, and starred on Broadway in \"Cabaret\". Lea can currently be seen on ABC Family's Peabody Award winning hit show \"Switched at Birth,\" where she acts and directs. Lea's movie credits include: \"All the Right Moves,\" \"Red Dawn,\" \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" \"The Beverly Hillbillies,\" \"Howard The Duck\"(star and vocals), Clint Eastwood's \"J. Edgar;\" the 2014 Sundance favorite \"Ping Pong Summer;\" and soon to be released \"Left Behind\" starring Nicolas Cage. Lea lives in Los Angeles with her husband of twenty-five years, film/television director Howard Deutch, and their two talented daughters, Madelyn and Zoey, along with many dogs, fish, horses, chickens, a cat, tortoise, and parrot. She supports and often performs for breast cancer, mental health, and Alzheimer's charities. Lea is currently in pre-production on \"The Year of Spectacular Men\", a film written by her daughter Madelyn Deutch, and is writing her first book of essays. Lea Thompson will partner with international Mirrorball Trophy holder Artem Chigvintsev on the 19th season of \"Dancing With The Stars.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5ODcyODUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA3MDg1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000670","name":"Lea Thompson","idIMDB":"nm0000670"},"actorId":"nm0000670","character":"Lorraine Baines","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001833","main":true},{"actorName":"Crispin Glover","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000417","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMDQ1NzE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1NjU4Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 April 1964","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Crispin Hellion Glover","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"While he's never been a typical leading man, Crispin Glover has distinguished himself as one of the most intriguing personalities in the movie business. His unusual characters and personal projects have inspired a cult-like following that has dubbed him both madman and genius. The son of actor Bruce Glover, Crispin Hellion Glover was born in New York City and raised in Southern California. He picked up his father's trade while still in elementary school--by age 13, he already had an agent scouting out parts. A lead in a stage production of \"The Sound of Music\" (starring Florence Henderson) led to guest spots on the TV shows Happy Days (1974), Hill Street Blues (1981) and Family Ties (1982), which in turn led to roles in made-for-TV movies. The adolescent Glover felt \"confined\" by TV work, however, so he opted to stick to movie parts. He made his big-screen debut in the teen hi-jinx movie in My Tutor (1983), then followed up with a supporting role in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984). Glover's most defining Hollywood moment happened the next year, when he appeared as George McFly (Michael J. Fox's father) in the instant classic Back to the Future (1985). The underdog character struck a chord with moviegoers. Oddly enough, the actor delivered one of his favorite performances around the same time - playing a small-town kid obsessed with Olivia Newton-John in the indie The Orkly Kid (1985)--but the smaller film was completely overshadowed by his commercial success. Glover did, however, receive critical praise for his next indie role, a starring turn as a high-strung murder witness in River's Edge (1986). Glover and the producers did not come to a financial agreement for him to reprise the role of George McFly in Back to the Future Part II (1989). The producers brought the character back to life by splicing together archived footage and new scenes (using an actor in prosthetic makeup). Glover, who hadn't given permission for his likeness to be used, sued the film's producer, Steven Spielberg, and won. The case prompted the Screen Actors Guild to devise new regulations about the use of actors' images. In 1990 Glover teamed up with fellow eccentric David Lynch to play the maniacal Cousin Dell in Wild at Heart (1990). He filled the next decade with similarly quirky, peripheral roles, including a turn as Andy Warhol in The Doors (1991) and a cameo as a train fireman in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man (1995). His small but memorable appearances in films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) often outshone the main action. When he's not stealing scenes from Hollywood hotshots, Glover pours his considerable energy into other creative endeavors. He wrote his first book, \"Billow Rock\", before age 18, and since then he's gone on to create a library of peculiar titles (several of which have been published through his family's Volcanic Eruptions press). Among his most famous volumes are \"Rat Catching\" and \"Oak-Mot\", both Victorian-era stories updated with macabre illustrations and cut-up text. In 1989 he released an album of spoken word readings and cover tunes (including a rendition of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\") entitled \"The Big Problem [does not equal] the Solution. The Solution = Let it be.\" In 1995 Glover began shooting his directorial debut, What Is It? (2005), a surreal film populated entirely by actors with Down's Syndrome. He tours with the film and it's sequel It is fine. Everything is fine! and his show, \"Crispin Hellion Glover's Big Slide Show,\" which is a one hour dramatic narration of eight different profusely illustrated books. The artist in Glover has been said to be inspired by \"the aesthetic of discomfort,\" a theme which seems to have been carried over into an artistic public performance on David Letterman's NBC show in 1987, Glover emerged wearing a wig and platform shoes, then delivered a swift kick toward Letterman's head that prompted the producers to cut to a commercial. Late 2000 saw him hitting the multiplex with roles in Nurse Betty (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000), and the titular Willard (2003). He re-teamed with Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis as Grendel in Beowulf (2007) and has worked with Johnny Depp for the third time in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010). Other Glover projects loom on the not-too-distant horizon.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMDQ1NzE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1NjU4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000417","name":"Crispin Glover","idIMDB":"nm0000417"},"actorId":"nm0000417","character":"George McFly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001830","main":true},{"actorName":"Thomas F.

He has more than 50 films, television shows and comedy specials to his credit, and has appeared on talk shows with everyone from Johnny Carson to Jay Leno to David Letterman to Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford.

The Los Angeles-born performer developed a driving passion for acting in her teen years. She went on to attend the Summer Drama Workshop at California State University, Northridge. Producer Allan Carr discovered this comic bundle when she invited him to see her in an L.A. stage review. He gave her an unbilled part in the John Travolta/Olivia Newton-John smash musical Grease (1978) and she was off and running. Other films quickly fell into place, notably I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978) as a no-holds-barred Beatles fanatic, and the role of Linda McFly in Back to the Future (1985) and one of its sequels. Other films included Corvette Summer (1978), Steven Spielberg's 1941 (1979) and Bachelor Party (1984) starring Tom Hanks. Some of her tongue-in-cheek film roles were beneath her, particularly when they used her excess poundage as the butt of a cruel joke, but the actress proved quite game in such lowbrow, youth-oriented comedies as Moving Violations (1985) and Stewardess School (1986). It was with a then fairly unknown Hanks and Peter Scolari that she earned her biggest laughs with the two-year run of Bosom Buddies (1980), which launched a number of inferior drag film/sitcoms. She also had series co-leads in Private Benjamin (1981), Women in Prison (1987), the plus-sized Babes (1990) and Hearts Afire (1992). In between were roles on the L.A. stage, including \"Pizza Man,\" \"Isn't It Romantic,\" \"Reality and Other Nightmares\" and Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" starring Ron Silver. At age 39, Wendie was diagnosed with breast cancer. While her career momentum was certainly compromised, the comedienne continued to pursue roles. She even appeared on a poignant breast cancer episode of Murphy Brown (1988). Her cancer went into remission at one point but returned with a vengeance in 2002 and spread throughout her body. Instead of retreating, Wendie instead reached out and founded weSPARK Cancer Support Center in Sherman Oaks, California, in which free services, including support groups, information on the latest research and classes, provided invaluable aid to cancer patients, their families and friends. Her selfless determination throughout her illness to help others did not go unnoticed, earning several honors. Eight years later, on November 29, 2005, Wendie lost her battle. She was survived by her parents and two children from a former marriage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTk1MDI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNTcyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0818274","name":"Wendie Jo Sperber","idIMDB":"nm0818274"},"actorId":"nm0818274","character":"Linda McFly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001840","main":true},{"actorName":"George DiCenzo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225191","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDczNjUzNDI1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzMTYxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 April 1940","placeOfBirth":" New Haven, Connecticut, USA","birthName":"George Ralph DiCenzo","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"George DiCenzo was born on April 21, 1940 in New Haven, Connecticut, USA as George Ralph DiCenzo.

Tolkan first began acting in movies in the late 1960s and was highly effective in two pictures for Sidney Lumet: He was a rabidly homophobic police lieutenant in the superbly gritty Serpico (1973) and a sneaky district attorney in the equally excellent Prince of the City (1981). Best known as the obnoxiously overzealous high school principal Gerard Strickland in the Back to the Future films, Tolkan's other most memorable roles include Napolean in Woody Allen's Love and Death (1975), a ramrod army officer in WarGames (1983), mayor Robert Culp's mordant, wisecracking assistant in Turk 182! (1985), the hard-nosed Stinger in Top Gun (1986), the choleric Detective Lubric in Masters of the Universe (1987), meek mob accountant Numbers in Dick Tracy (1990), and Wesley Snipes' bullish superior in Boiling Point (1993). James has had recurring parts on the television series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2000) (he also directed two episodes), Mary (1985), Cobra (1993), The Hat Squad (1992) and Remington Steele (1982). Among the television series James has done guest spots on are Naked City (1958), Hill Street Blues (1981), Miami Vice (1984), The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990), The Equalizer (1985), The Wonder Years (1988) and The Pretender (1996). Besides his film and television work, Tolkan has also performed on stage in productions of such plays as \"Between Two Thieves\", \"Wings\", \"One Tennis Shoe\", \"The Front Page\", \"Twelve Angry Men\", \"Full Circle\", \"The Tempest\", \"Golda\", \"The Silent Partner\" and the original 1984 Broadway production of David Mamet's \"Glengary, Glen Ross\". When he isn't acting, James Tolkan spends his spare time collecting folk art.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDcyNzQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjExNTgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866055","name":"James Tolkan","idIMDB":"nm0866055"},"actorId":"nm0866055","character":"Mr. Strickland","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001843","main":true},{"actorName":"J.J.

Siemaszko was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Polish father and a British mother. His sister is actress Nina Siemaszko. His first film role was in the Rob Lowe vehicle Class (1983), which also featured John Cusack, Andrew McCarthy, and Alan Ruck. He appeared with Charlie Sheen and Chad Lowe in Silence of the Heart (1984) and the following year in both Secret Admirer (1985) with C. Thomas Howell and Back to the Future (1985) with Michael J. Fox. The second half of the 1980s showed no break from the 'Brat Pack'. Indeed, Casey took a role in the Stephen King-adapted and Rob Reiner-directed Stand by Me (1986) in which he appeared alongside John Cusack, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherlandand Wil Wheaton. He gain appeared with Kiefer Sutherland that same year in Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories (1985). A substantial role came with the Matthew Broderick comedy Biloxi Blues (1988) and he reprised his role as 3-D in the sequel, Back to the Future Part II (1989). He saw the 1980s out with a starring role in the Brat Pack blockbuster Young Guns (1988) alongside Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Lou Diamond Phillips. Casey has added a string of quality movies to his resume, including a great performance in Of Mice and Men (1992) directed by - and starring - Gary Sinise, and based on the acclaimed novel by John Steinbeck. It seems he has left the 'Brat Pack' long behind, but nobody can deny the top notch performances he put into these great movies. In 2009 he appeared in the Michael Mann film Public Enemies (2009). Casey starred in the Rob Lowe film Killing Kennedy (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1MTAxNzIyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA2ODczMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797150","name":"Casey Siemaszko","idIMDB":"nm0797150"},"actorId":"nm0797150","character":"3-D","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001838","main":true},{"actorName":"Billy Zane","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000708","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NzA2NTE0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAxMTUxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 February 1966","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"William George Zane Jr.","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"William George Zane, better known as Billy Zane, was born on February 24, 1966 in Chicago, Illinois, to Thalia (Colovos) and William Zane, both of Greek ancestry. His parents were amateur actors and managed a medical technical school. Billy has an older sister, actress and singer Lisa Zane. Billy was bitten by the acting bug early on. In his early teens, he attended Harand Camp of the Theater Arts in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. In 1982, he attended the American School in Switzerland. His high school days were spent at Francis Parker High School in Chicago, Illinois. Daryl Hannah and Jennifer Beals also attended Parker, prior to Billy's attendance. Soon after graduating from high school, Billy decided to venture out to California to attempt acting for the first time. Within three weeks, he won his very first big screen role in Back to the Future (1985), playing the role of Match, one of Biff Tannen's thugs. He would later reprise that role for the sequel Back to the Future Part II (1989). Then after a small role in the science fiction horror film Critters (1986), he landed starring roles in several television films. Billy played villain Hughie Warriner in the Australian thriller film Calme blanc (1989), where he met his future wife, Lisa Collins. He also co-starred in Memphis Belle (1990), a film version of a 1944 documentary about a World War II bomber. In 1991, he appeared as John Justice Wheeler on several episodes of David Lynch's television series Twin Peaks (1990). Billy starred as the eponymous superhero in Le fantôme du Bengale (1996) and as Caledon Hockley in the billion dollar grossing Titanic (1997).
