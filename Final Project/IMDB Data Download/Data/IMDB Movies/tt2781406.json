His paternal grandfather was Jamaican, and one of his grandmothers was Swedish. After years of small parts, he finally got his big break in an unexpected way, playing the dim-witted Tommy in Guy Ritchie's film, Snatch (2000). Apparently, Graham didn't audition for the role as Tommy--one day, he accompanied a friend to the audition for Ritchie and was asked if he was next. When Graham replied \"no,\" Ritchie told the then-unknown actor, \"I like your face,\" and was asked if he could start work Monday. So much is to be said of this actor, who started his career with bit parts on ITV (he played Lee Sankey on Coronation Street (2006) in 1999 and was also cast in smaller films like Pit Fighter (2005). Graham also appeared in the critically acclaimed Gangs of New York (2002), directed by Martin Scorsese, and on television, playing Sgt. Myron 'Mike' Ranney in the HBO mini-series, \"Band of Brothers.\" The actor, though still relatively unknown, is climbing the ladder to the top very quickly, with roles in some of the most groundbreaking film and television projects.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1NTc1NjM5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk3MDU0NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0334318","name":"Stephen Graham","idIMDB":"nm0334318"},"actorId":"nm0334318","character":"Benjamin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Smiley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0806968","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3MzY0MTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI5OTM0OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1963","placeOfBirth":" Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Michael Smiley was born in 1963 in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

He is especially gifted at picking up accents and dialects from around this country and the rest of the world and making them sound natural and native. It was in the Reps and National Tours that he learnt the art of \"deliberately staying there, watching and listening to other performers\". It is often said that the best Actors are the ones that listen... Sidney is a past master at this art. He has superb comic timing as well as magnetic stage presence. He is also a breeze to work with! Sidney has numerous credits to his CV, has been performing professionally all his life and has excelled at theatrical roles as diverse as Agatha Christie to Shakespeare, light-hearted comedy to dark tragedy, experimental performance art to pantomime, musical Theatre to farce, serious television and film drama to Children's Theatre. His work has led to him travelling extensively nationally and globally and has worked with perhaps some of the finest Actors and Directors of his generation including Rod Steiger and Sir Lawrence Olivier.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3OTE1MTg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NDA0OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443821","name":"Sidney Kean","idIMDB":"nm0443821"},"actorId":"nm0443821","character":"Saul","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joshua Youngerman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5588847","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODM1NjYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY4NjE4OTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 December 1988","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Joshua Aronson Youngerman","bio":"Joshua Youngerman is an actor known for Enemies in Love, The One, and 50 Ways to Kill Your Lover.
