After the 1989 revolution, following a conflict with the new executive director of the theater, Visarion Alexa, he moved to Cluj-Napoca, taking two jobs: as an actor at the local National Theater, and as a drama professor at the Babes-Boylai University. Unfortunately, the abusive policy of the theater's director, the actor Dorel Visan, led him to despair, ultimately causing his death of a stroke, after one month of agony in intensive therapy.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1331198","name":"Vistrian Roman","idIMDB":"nm1331198"},"actorId":"nm1331198","character":"Lt.
