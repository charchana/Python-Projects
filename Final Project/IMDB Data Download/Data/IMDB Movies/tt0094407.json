In the 1960s, he presented the TV series \"Cartoon\" which featured short animated cartoons from all over the world. In between the clips he acted in little funny sketches. These sketches were by a long way the funniest thing on German television and so Loriot was given his own TV show, only with sketches and no cartoons (except the odd one made by himself). This show turned out to be hugely successful and he was finally persuaded to lift this format to the feature film with Ödipussi (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0902086","name":"Vicco von Bülow","nicknames":["Loriot"],"idIMDB":"nm0902086"},"actorId":"nm0902086","character":"Paul Winkelmann","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Katharina Brauren","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0105962","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 April 1910","placeOfBirth":" Grabow, Germany","bio":"Katharina Brauren was born on April 21, 1910 in Grabow, Germany.
