He was the Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the Pacific Fleet during World War I. In the early 1920s, George wound up in Hollywood where he worked as a stuntman and part time actor. In 1924, Director John Ford picked virtually unknown George to star in his first picture, The Iron Horse (1924). Over the next two years, he would appear in four more Ford films and would co-star with Janet Gaynor in The Blue Eagle (1926) and Sunrise (1927). \"Sunrise,\" a winner of two Academy Awards, was the story of a simple farmer who lets another woman talk him into murdering his wife. George remained popular until sound came along. By that time, his popularity was sliding, but he did make the transition to sound. With his rugged looks and physical size, he was soon a Western Cowboy Star. He was in some of the best stories ever written, Riders of the Purple Sage (1931), and in some of the worst. But he was consistently in the Top Ten money-making Western Stars. He would appear in a few films outside the horse set, such as Ever Since Eve (1934), but those roles would be few. By the end of the 1930s, George was still a popular 'B' movie Cowboy Star, but he would not take the parts as seriously as he did a decade before. During World War II, he hung up his spurs, and he re-enlisted in the Navy where he fought in the Pacific and was decorated many times. After the war, when he would not find work in acting, John Ford, his old Director, would give him work with the cavalry in three of his films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MDg3NjYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTk0NzU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639563","name":"George O'Brien","nicknames":["\"The Chest\""],"idIMDB":"nm0639563"},"actorId":"nm0639563","character":"The Man","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0131526","main":true},{"actorName":"Janet Gaynor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0310980","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzE4Nzk0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjg0NzU2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 October 1906","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Laura Augusta Gainor","height":"5' (1.52 m)","bio":"Janet Gaynor was born Laura Gainor on October 6, 1906, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a child, she & her parents moved to San Francisco, California, where she graduated from high school in 1923. She then moved to Los Angeles where she enrolled in a secretarial school. She got a job at a shoe store for the princely sum of $18 per week. However, since L.A. was the land of stars and studios, she wanted to try her hand at acting. She managed to land unbilled bit parts in several feature films and comedy shorts. She bided her time, believing \"Good things come to those who wait.\" She didn't have to wait too long, either. In 1926, at the age of 20, she turned in a superb performance as Anna Burger in The Johnstown Flood (1926). The Hollywood moguls knew they had a top star on their hands and cast her in several other leading roles that year, including The Shamrock Handicap (1926), The Blue Eagle (1926), The Midnight Kiss (1926) and The Return of Peter Grimm (1926). The next year she turned in acclaimed performances in two classic films, 7th Heaven (1927) and Sunrise (1927). Based on the strength of those two films plus Street Angel (1928), Janet received the very first Academy Award for best actress. This was the first and only time an actress won the Oscar for multiple roles. When \"talkies\" replaced silent films, Janet was one of the few who made a successful transition, not only because of her great acting ability but for her charming voice as well. Without a doubt, Janet had already lived a true rags-to-riches story. Throughout the mid-1930s she was the top drawing star at theaters. She turned in grand performances in several otherwise undistinguished films. Then came A Star Is Born (1937). She was very convincing as Vicki Lester (aka Esther Blodgett), struggling actress trying for the big time. Told by the receptionist at Central casting \"You know what your chances are? One in a hundred thousand,\" Esther/Vicki replies, \"But maybe--I'm that one.\" For her outstanding performance she was nominated for another Oscar, but lost to Luise Rainer's performance in The Good Earth (1937), her second in as many tries. After appearing in The Young in Heart (1938), Janet didn't appear in another film until 1957's Bernardine (1957). Her last performance was in a Broadway version of Harold and Maude. Although the play was a flop, Janet's performance salvaged it to any degree - she still had what it took to entertain the public. On September 14, 1984, Janet passed away from pneumonia in Palm Springs, California, at the age of 77.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzE4Nzk0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjg0NzU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0310980","name":"Janet Gaynor","nicknames":["Lolly"],"idIMDB":"nm0310980"},"actorId":"nm0310980","character":"The Wife","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0131527","main":true},{"actorName":"Margaret Livingston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515272","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5ODY0ODQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4NDk3MTE@._V1._CR0.883331298828125,2.5333404541015625,231,297_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 November 1900","placeOfBirth":" Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Margaret Livingston was born on November 25, 1900 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

The former Ziegfeld Follies dancer appeared in a good number of films from 1925--if not as the nominal star then, at least, very high up the list of credits. Her aloof beauty was tailor-made for playing patrician socialites and she breezed through many such roles in both comedy and drama. Her most famous role, ironically, was as Donna Isobel in Don Juan (1926), not because of the acting involved (even though the star was John Barrymore), but because it first used the Vitaphone process to synchronize film and sound effects (though no dialogue), effectively making it a precursor to The Jazz Singer (1927), released a year later. At Warner Brothers, Jane appeared back to back in the period drama My Official Wife (1926) and one of the studio's most successful comedies of the year, Why Girls Go Back Home (1926), as a seductive model. She was also third-billed as the vamp rivaling Marion Davies for the affections of Johnny Mack Brown in The Fair Co-Ed (1927), and as Davies' elder sister in her biggest hit, The Patsy (1928). She had smaller roles in two A-grade productions: the classic Sunrise (1927) and the Howard Hughes-produced World War I epic Hell's Angels (1930). At the peak of her career, Jane--at her most glamorous--essayed a murder suspect in The Furies (1930), adapted for the screen by Zoe Akins. Jane's star faded abruptly after 1930. She made a few more appearances in several 17- and 18-minute mystery \"featurettes\", made at the Warner Brothers Vitaphone facilities in Brooklyn. In 1937 she left acting altogether. It is not entirely clear what, exactly, killed off her career. One might logically surmise, that it was the transition to sound pictures, yet the problem was not with the quality of her voice. In fact, she became a soprano of international repute, a one-time diva with the National Grand Opera Company in 1933, performing in \"Pagliacci\". Some years later she also sang on radio broadcasts in England. In any event, Jane went globe-trotting and devoted time to her various other talents. She was said to have been a decent painter and certainly played bridge rather well (a tribute to one of her three husbands, a grand master of the game, Michael T. Gottlieb). In the early 1950s the multi-faceted Jane also wrote two novels: \"Park Avenue Doctor\" and the period romance \"Passion is the Gale\", a tale of \"temptation and torment\" set in the Virgin Islands, featuring pirates, damsels in distress and other expected accouterments of the genre. Jane Winton She died in 1959, aged just 54. As Gloria Swanson famously said in Sunset Boulevard (1950): \"There just aren't any faces like that anymore . . . \".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NzY3MTAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ2OTY3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0936079","name":"Jane Winton","idIMDB":"nm0936079"},"actorId":"nm0936079","character":"The Manicure Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0180687","main":true},{"actorName":"Arthur Housman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396768","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 October 1889","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"Arthur Housman was born on October 10, 1889 in New York City, New York, USA.
