Born into a family that were always telling jokes, playing pranks, and just acting the fools. As a young student, Donavon was always disrupting class with his outlandish and hilarious behavior. He soon discovered the excitement and freedom of drama class and under the tutelage of his drama teacher, he quickly knew what his calling was.

A close friend had him audition for a role in the cartoon Heavy Gear, produced by Mainframe Entertainment, one of the first companies to utilize the growing technology of motion capture. He landed the role and quickly started getting cast in many other shows including Spiderman, Max Steel, Barbie, and the sci-fi thriller hit District 9. After several years, many cartoons and multiple video games later, Donavon became the \"go to\" guy for motion capture roles in Vancouver. The progression in to TV and film came easily to Donavon. He landed his first ever acting audition for the FOX series Dark Angel and was successfully chosen for the role. Donavon followed this with several film roles including the romantic comedy A GuyThing , the blockbuster hits Fantastic Four, X-Files: I Want To Believe and most recently, the epic fantasy WarCraft.
