The story centers on an apartment building with a delicatessen on the ground floor. The owner of the eatery also owns the apartment building and he is in need of a new maintenance man since the original \"mysteriously\" disappeared. A former clown applies for the job and the butcher's intent is to have him work for a little while and then serve him to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in, of course, grain. The clown and butcher's daughter fall in love and she tries to foil her father's plans by contacting the \"troglodytes\", a grain eating sub-group of society who live entirely underground. The \"trogs\" are possibly the most sensible of the lot, as they see food as food and not money.","simplePlot":"Post-apocalyptic surrealist black comedy about the landlord of an apartment building who occasionally prepares a delicacy for his odd tenants.","actors":[{"actorName":"Pascal Benezech","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0070991","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcwODY1NDk0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwOTAyNw@@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Pascal Benezech is an actor, known for Delicatessen (1991), Coup de tête (1979) and Arlette (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcwODY1NDk0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwOTAyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0070991","name":"Pascal Benezech","idIMDB":"nm0070991"},"actorId":"nm0070991","character":"Tried to Escape","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0202697","main":true},{"actorName":"Dominique Pinon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0684500","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2Njg1MDQ2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ3Mjk1OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 March 1955","placeOfBirth":" Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, Pays de la Loire, France","birthName":"Dominique Jean-Claude Pinon","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Born in Saumur, France on 4th March, 1955, Dominique Pinon made his first cinematic appearance in 1980, in La Decouverte.

Born in 1914 the son of a Swiss father and American mother, Howard received his dramatic training in both Berlin and Paris and was originally a stage and radio player (from 1945) before arriving in post-war French films. He articulated and personified a number of nefarious Nazis and sinister criminals in his five-decade career, although he could grab a sympathetic role from time such as in the French film Le Silence de la Mer (1949), which remains one of his best. Occasionally a still photographer, he forged a long, non-creative association beginning in the early 1960s with cult director Jess Franco following his good showing for Fritz Lang in _Tausend Augen des Dr. Mabuse, Die (1960)_ [The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]. With his piercing gaze and gravely-voiced he entered into an enduring alliance with Franco, albeit in dreadful schlock. It began promisingly enough with the horror classic The Awful Dr. Orlof (1962) [The Awful Dr. Orloff] in which he portrayed the creepy title role with a slightly sympathetic countenance, but his appearances quickly degenerated into cheap exploitation, void of deserving artistic merit. He died in Paris shortly after his 82nd birthday.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894677","name":"Howard Vernon","idIMDB":"nm0894677"},"actorId":"nm0894677","character":"Frog Man","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0203657","main":true},{"actorName":"Chick Ortega","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650849","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 March 1961","placeOfBirth":" Nancy, France","bio":"Chick Ortega was born on March 10, 1961 in Nancy, France.
