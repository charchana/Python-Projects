(an insurance salesman) and Helen Altman. He entered St. Peters Catholic school at the age six, and spent a short time at a Catholic high school. From there, he went to Rockhurst High School. It was then that he started exploring the art of exploring sound with the cheap tape recorders available at the time. He was then sent to Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri where he attended through Junior College. In 1945, he enlisted in the Air Force and became a copilot of a B-24. After his discharge from the military, he became fascinated by movies and he and his first wife, LaVonne Elmer, moved to Hollywood, where Altman tried acting (appearing in the film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947)), songwriting (he wrote a musical intended for Broadway, \"The Rumors are Flying\"), and screen-writing (he co-wrote the screenplay for the film Bodyguard (1948) and wrote the story (uncredited) for Christmas Eve (1947)), but he could not get a foot hold in Tinseltown. After a brief fling as publicity director with a company in the business of tattooing dogs, Altman finally gave up and returned to his hometown of Kansas City, where he decided he wanted to do some serious work in filmmaking. An old friend of his recommended him to a film production company in Kansas City, the Calvin Co., who hired him in 1950. After a few months of work in writing scripts and editing films, Altman began directing films at Calvin. It was here (while working on documentaries, employee training films, industrial and educational films and advertisements) that he learned much about film making. All in all, Altman pieced together sixty to sixty-five short films for Calvin on every subject imaginable, from football to car crashes, but he kept grasping for more challenging projects. He wrote the screenplay for the Kansas City-produced feature film Corn's-A-Poppin' (1955), he produced and directed several television commercials including one with the Eileen Ford Agency, he co-created and directed the TV series The Pulse of the City (1953) which ran for one season on the independent Dumont network, and he even had a formative crack at directing local community theater. His big-screen directorial debut came while still at Calvin with The Delinquents (1957) and, by 1956, he left the Calvin Co., and went to Hollywood to direct Alfred Hitchcock's TV show. From here, he went on to direct a large number of television shows, until he was offered the script for MASH (1970) in 1969. He was hardly the producer's first choice - more than fifteen other directors had already turned it down. This wasn't his first movie, but it was his first success. After that, he had his share of hits and misses, but The Player (1992) and, more recently, Gosford Park (2001) were particularly well-received.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYxMzE1NDUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjAyMjc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000265","name":"Robert Altman","nicknames":["Bob"],"idIMDB":"nm0000265"},"actorId":"nm0000265","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Bresson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000975","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5NjEzMDc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA0MDMyOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 September 1901","placeOfBirth":" Bromont-Lamothe, Puy-de-Dôme, France","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Robert Bresson trained as a painter before moving into films as a screenwriter, making a short film (atypically a comedy), Affaires publiques (1934) in 1934. After spending more than a year as a German POW during World War II, he made his debut with Les anges du péché (1943) in 1943. His next film, Les dames du Bois de Boulogne (1945) would be the last time he would work with professional actors. From _Journal d'un cure de campagne (1951)_ (aka \"Diary of a Country Priest\") onwards, he created a unique minimalist style in which all but the barest essentials are omitted from the film (often, crucial details are only given in the soundtrack), with the actors (he calls them \"models\") giving deliberately flat, expressionless performances. It's a demanding and difficult, intensely personal style, which means that his films never achieved great popularity (it was rare for him to make more than one film every five years), but he has a fanatical following among critics, who rate him as one of the greatest artists in the history of the cinema. He retired in the 1980s, after failing to raise the money for a long-planned adaptation of the Book of Genesis.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5NjEzMDc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA0MDMyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000975","name":"Robert Bresson","idIMDB":"nm0000975"},"actorId":"nm0000975","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Costa-Gavras","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002020","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNTQ0NjYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU1MjA1NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 February 1933","placeOfBirth":" Loutra-Iraias, Greece","birthName":"Konstantinos Gavras","bio":"Costa-Gavras was born on February 12, 1933 in Loutra-Iraias, Greece as Konstantinos Gavras.

His mother, Betsy Franco, is Jewish, and his father, Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, was of Portuguese and Swedish descent, and ran a Silicon Valley business. James's mother, a writer, has occasionally acted. Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Whatever It Takes (2000). Although he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy. Next was Deuces Wild (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean (2001). He was recently seen in David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Nights in Rodanthe (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' In the Valley of Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyOTc0MjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgyODQwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556","name":"James Franco","nicknames":["Ted, Teddy"],"idIMDB":"nm0290556"},"actorId":"nm0290556","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ken Jacobs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0414499","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1933","placeOfBirth":" Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","bio":"Ken Jacobs was born on May 25, 1933 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA.

Within a few years, Kurosawa had achieved sufficient stature to allow him greater creative freedom. Drunken Angel (1948)--\"Drunken Angel\"--was the first film he made without extensive studio interference, and marked his first collaboration with Toshirô Mifune. In the coming decades, the two would make 16 movies together, and Mifune became as closely associated with Kurosawa's films as was John Wayne with the films of Kurosawa's idol, John Ford. After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made his international breakthrough film Rashomon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key, touching Ikiru (1952) (Living), the epic Seven Samurai (1954), the barbaric, riveting Shakespeare adaptation Throne of Blood (1957), and a fun pair of samurai comedies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide. He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\" He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Dreams (1990), Rhapsodie en août (1991) and Maadadayo (1993). Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan Hunter) with suspicion - but he's revered by American and European film-makers, who remade Rashomon (1950) as The Outrage (1964), Seven Samurai (1954), as The Magnificent Seven (1960), Yojimbo (1961), as A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3ODQwNTY2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5ODM1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000041","name":"Akira Kurosawa","nicknames":["The Emperor","Wind Man"],"idIMDB":"nm0000041"},"actorId":"nm0000041","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonas Mekas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0577263","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 December 1922","placeOfBirth":" Semeniskiai, Lithuania","bio":"Jonas Mekas, born December 24, 1922, Semeniskiai, Birzai, Lithuania, is a director, cinematographer, editor, writer, actor, poet, artist and publicist. More than 60 years of tireless work in film, arts and media has earned him the epithet \"The Godfather of American Avant-Garde Cinema\". In 1944 Jonas Mekas left Lithuania, with his brother Adolfas, because of the war. The both of them were imprisoned in a labor-camp in Elmshorn, Germany. After eight months they escaped to Denmark. By the end of 1949 the Mekas brothers emigrated to the U.S., settling in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. Two weeks after his arrival, he borrowed the money to buy his first Bolex 16mm camera and began to record brief moments of his life. Soon he got deeply involved in the American Avant-Garde film movement. In 1954, together with his brother, he started Film Culture magazine, which soon became the most important film publication in the US. In 1958 Jonas Mekas began his legendary Movie Journal column in the Village Voice. In 1962 he founded the Film-Makers' Cooperative, and in 1964 the Film-Makers' Cinematheque, which eventually grew into Anthology Film Archives, one of the world's largest and most important repositories of avant-garde cinema, and a screening venue. Jonas Mekas film \"The Brig\" was awarded the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1963. Other films include \"Walden\" (1969), \"Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania\" (1972), \"Lost Lost Lost\" (1975), \"Scenes from the Life of Andy Warhol\" (1990), \"Scenes from the Life of George Maciunas\" (1992), \"As I was Moving Ahead I saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty\" (2000), \"Letter from Greenpoint\" (2005), \"Sleepless Nights Stories\" (2011) and \"Out-takes from the Life of a Happy Man\" (2012).
