He was born Ivan Ilyich Mozzhukhin on September 26, 1889, in the village of Kondol, Saratov province, Russia (now Penza province, Russia). His father was general manager of the large estate of Prince Obolensky. Mozzhukhin attended all-boys Gymnasium in Penza, then studied at the Law School of Moscow University for two years. There he was active in amateur stage productions and joined a touring troupe, then returned to Moscow and was a member of the Vvedensky Narodny Dom Theatre. He made his film debut in 1908. From 1911-14 he worked in the films of producer Aleksandr Khanzhonkov. Mozzhukhin shot to fame after his leading role as violinist Trukhachevsky in La sonate de Kreutzer (1911) by director Pyotr Chardynin, based on the eponymous story by Leo Tolstoy. He starred as Adm. Kornilov in La défense de Sébastopol (1911) and in about 30 more silent films made by Chardynin, Yevgeni Bauer and Khanzhyonkov. By the mid-'10s Mozzhukhin was the indisputable leading star of the Russian cinema, having such film partners as 'Diaghilev''s ballerina Vera Karalli, and his own wife Nathalie Lissenko. His facial expressions were studied by many actors and directors as exemplary acting masks. From 1915-19 he worked in about 40 films by directors Yakov Protazanov and Viktor Tourjansky under the legendary Russian producer Joseph N. Ermolieff. His best known films of the Russian period were The Queen of Spades (1916) and Le père Serge (1918), both by Protazanov. Mozzhukhin's incredible popularity brought him significant wealth, but that came with attendant pressure; he also became famous for his numerous love affairs with his admirers. In 1918 the Russian Communist revolution had already caused irreversible destruction of cultural and economic life, and Mozzhukhin moved under protection of the anti-Communist White Russian forces in Yalta, Crimea. There he worked for Ermolieff during the Russian Civil War. Meanwhile, Soviet government leader V.I. Lenin ordered the seizure and nationalization of all film studios and their films, properties and other assets to use for making Soviet propaganda' most of Mozzhukhin's 70 films were arrested and / or censored. Lev Kuleshov used fragments of Mozzhukhin's films to demonstrate his editing ideas. Mozzhukhin's face was used in Kuleshov's psychological montage to illustrate the principles of film editing, known today as the Kuleshov Effect. Mozzhukhin suffered terribly from the loss of his property after the Communist revolution. However, he continued working in Yalta with Ermolieff until the end of 1919. When the Red Army advanced into Crimea and broke through to Yalta, however, he joined the White Russians and fled the now-communist Russia at the end of the Civil War. He managed to save a few rolls of his silent films, which he took aboard the Greek steamer Pantera\\ in February of 1920. He left Russia together with his film partners from the Ermolieff film company, his wife Nathalie Lissenko, actors Nicolas Koline and Nicolas Rimsky, actress Nathalie Kovanko, cinematographer Nikolai Toporkoff, director Viktor Tourjansky and producer Joseph N. Ermolieff. They emigrated together to Paris, France, and started a Russian-French film company. In 1926 Mozzhukhin got a lucrative contract with Universal Pictures in Hollywood, and was cast as the male lead in Surrender (1927). However, his stint in Hollywood was not a success, due to numerous pressures from the studio's producers who insisted on his taking the stage name John Moskin. In addition, Mozzhukhin and his female co-star Mary Philbin did not get along at all, and that was quite apparent from the footage that they had no chemistry whatever. Ats Hollywood at that time was just making the transition from silent films to talkies, Mozzuhkhin--who did not speak English--was not offered any further roles, and he returned to Europe. Soon Aleksandr Vertinskiy began to comment that Mozzhukhin's troubles in Hollywood were the results of a conspiracy by the powers in Hollywood to destroy a strong competitor. By 1939 Mozzhukhin had made over 100 films in Russia, France, Italy, the US, Germany and Austria. He continued starring in the talkies of the 1930s, although not as successfully as he had during the silent era. He also wrote screenplays for several of his films, and planned to direct a film in France, but the project was abandoned because he contracted a severe form of tuberculosis and was hospitalized. Mozzhukhin died of tuberculosis in a Paris clinic on January 17, 1939, and was laid to rest in the Russian Cemetery at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, in Paris, France. Mozzhukhin's home in Kondol, Penza province, is now restored as the public Memorial Museum of Ivan Mozzhukhin. There, since the 1990s, the museum has annual showing of Mozzhukhin's films, also known as Mozzhukhin's Festivities.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxOTU2MzU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzODE1MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0610620","name":"Ivan Mozzhukhin","idIMDB":"nm0610620"},"actorId":"nm0610620","character":"Casanova","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0033702","main":true},{"actorName":"Suzanne Bianchetti","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0080572","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 February 1889","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","bio":"Suzanne Bianchetti was born on February 24, 1889 in Paris, France.

The daughter of a factory owner, Jenny was educated at a convent school in Austria. A short-lived marriage to the Italian actor Emo Jugo brought her to Berlin where she was spotted by the distinguished film producer Erich Pommer and subsequently signed to a contract with Ufa. Her comedic talents were not fully recognised until the first of her eleven films (Wer nimmt die Liebe ernst...? (1931)) under the direction of Erich Engel, who henceforth became her mentor. Jenny's forte was playing feisty, determined characters who tended to excel at oneupmanship. Her performance as Eliza Doolittle in Engel's adaptation of Pygmalion (1935) so enthused the author George Bernard Shaw that he offered her the opportunity to act in all of his plays on the stage in England. Jenny remained in Germany, nonetheless, and made several more hugely popular films with Engel, including Mädchenjahre einer Königin (1936), as a young Queen Victoria; The Night with the Emperor (1936) (several years later marrying her co-star, the actor Friedrich Benfer) and the musical comedy Nanette (1940). Though flourishing briefly as one of Ufa's top box office attractions, her star declined as the Third Reich began to favour Germanic-looking blondes. Jenny made only a couple of films after the war before retiring to her farm in Schönrain in Upper Bavaria. She was eventually honoured by the prestigious Filmband in Gold in 1971 for her contributions to German cinema. Confined to a wheelchair for the last two decades of her life, Jenny Jugo died in September 2001 at the respectable age of 97.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmEwODgwYTctNjQ0Ni00MmVmLTgwZmMtMjFiODFjN2MxNDRhL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432041","name":"Jenny Jugo","idIMDB":"nm0432041"},"actorId":"nm0432041","character":"Thérèse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rina De Liguoro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0209740","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 July 1892","placeOfBirth":" Florence, Tuscany, Italy","birthName":"Elena Caterina in De Liguoro","bio":"Rina De Liguoro was born on July 24, 1892 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy as Elena Caterina in De Liguoro.
