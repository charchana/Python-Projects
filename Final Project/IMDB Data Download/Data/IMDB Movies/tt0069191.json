His acting career was interrupted by wartime service (for six years) in the British Army. He then joined the Old Vic Company and subsequently appeared on screen. With his hooked nose and furtive eyes, he made the perfect sinister villain, playing an assortment of Arabic or Central Asian diamond smugglers, drug dealers or black market racketeers. Occasionally, he was on the right side of the law, notably as commissioner Govindaswami in Bhowani Junction (1956), or as a cardinal in The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968). Early on in his career, Maitland worked for Hammer Studios where he had memorable roles as Patel Shari, a member of the murderous Kali sect in The Stranglers of Bombay (1959), and as an evil Malay servant, dedicated to worshipping The Reptile (1966). Marne was also very active on British television (The Saint (1962), Department S (1969), and others) in very much the same capacity. He stood out as the mysterious dissident Pandit Baba in the excellent award-winning miniseries The Jewel in the Crown (1984). From the early 1970's until his death, he lived in Rome.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc3NDg4NDA3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMyNjk0NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537962","name":"Marne Maitland","idIMDB":"nm0537962"},"actorId":"nm0537962","character":"Guide in the Catacombs","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Renato Giovannoli","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320533","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Renato Giovannoli is an actor, known for Fellini Roma (1972) and Heidi (1978).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320533","name":"Renato Giovannoli","idIMDB":"nm0320533"},"actorId":"nm0320533","character":"Cardinal Ottaviani","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elisa Mainardi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537706","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc0MDkzMjYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEzODU5._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 July 1930","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","bio":"Elisa Mainardi was born on July 27, 1930 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.

She was the illegitimate child of Marina Magnani and an unknown father, often said to be from Alexandria, Egypt, but whom Anna herself claimed was from the Calabria region of Italy although she never knew his name. Raised in poverty by her maternal grandmother in Rome after her mother left her, Anna worked her way through Rome's Academy of Dramatic Art by singing in cabarets and nightclubs, then began touring the countryside with small repertory companies. Although she had a small role in a silent film in the late 1920s, she was not known as a film actress until 1941's _Teresa Venerdì(1941)_, directed by Vittorio De Sica. Her breakthrough film was Roberto Rossellini's Rome, ville ouverte (1945) (aka Open City), generally regarded as the first commercially successful Italian neo-realist film of the postwar years and the one that won her an international reputation. From then on, she didn't stop working in films and television, winning an Academy Award for her performance in the screen version of Tennessee Williams' The Rose Tattoo (1955), a part that was written for her by her close friend Williams. She worked with all of Italy's leading directors of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. She was renowned for her earthy, passionate, woman-of-the-soil roles. She and Rossellini were lovers for some years after Open City, until he began his infamous affair with Ingrid Bergman. Anna had one child out of wedlock by Italian actor Massimo Serato. The boy was later stricken with polio and Anna dedicated her life to caring for him. Her one marriage, to Italian director Goffredo Alessandrini in the mid-'30s, lasted only a short while and ended in an annulment. Her last film was Federico Fellini's Fellini Roma (1972). She died in Rome of a pancreatic tumor the next year.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NDcxNTAzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzE2OTE2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0536167","name":"Anna Magnani","nicknames":["La Magnani","Nannarella"],"idIMDB":"nm0536167"},"actorId":"nm0536167","character":"Anna Magnani","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ginette Marcelle Bron","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111377","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ginette Marcelle Bron is an actress, known for Fellini Roma (1972), The Sunday Woman (1975) and Le calde notti del Decameron (1972).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111377","name":"Ginette Marcelle Bron","idIMDB":"nm0111377"},"actorId":"nm0111377","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gore Vidal","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000683","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTUxNjkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjY4NTM0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 October 1925","placeOfBirth":" West Point, New York, USA","birthName":"Eugene Luther Gore Vidal","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Gore Vidal was born Eugene Louis Vidal in 1925 in West Point, New York, to Nina (Gore) and West Point aeronautics instructor and aviation pioneer Eugene Luther Vidal. The Vidals endured a rocky marriage divorcing ten years after Gore's birth. Young Gore spent much of his childhood with his blind grandfather, Senator T.P. Gore of Oklahoma. Vidal would later become the confidant of Jacqueline Kennedy when Jacques mother married his former step father, Hugh D. Auchincloss. After graduating from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1943, Gore joined the US Army Reserves. Some of his Army experiences inspired his first novel, Williwaw, which was published when he was just 19. He dedicated the novel to J.T., a deceased prep-school friend. Subsequent novels would prominently feature gay male characters, and Gore found soon found his books had staying power on bestseller lists. In 1960, he unsuccessfully ran for Congress, backed by celebrity supporters like Paul Newman & Vidal's ex-fiancé Joanne Woodward. Another unsuccessful foray into politics would occur in 1982 when he ran for governor of California. In addition to being an accomplished writer, he is also a novice actor. His biggest roles to date have been in Gattaca (1997), Bob Roberts (1992), and With Honors (1994).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTUxNjkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjY4NTM0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000683","name":"Gore Vidal","idIMDB":"nm0000683"},"actorId":"nm0000683","character":"Gore Vidal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0069191","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069191","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"SEK","country":"934,000","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 hr (120 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White","Color (Technicolor)"],"aspectRatio":["1.66 : 1 (theatrical ratio)","1.85 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Studio Longardi, Italy","Technicolor"],"filmLength":["3,482 m"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.4","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Cinecittà Studios, Cinecittà, Rome, Lazio, Italy"}],"rated":"R","awards":[{"award":"Golden Globes, USA 1973","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Golden Globe","categories":[{"category":"Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film","names":[]}]}]},{"award":"BAFTA Awards 1974","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated BAFTA Film Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Art Direction","names":[{"name":"Danilo Donati","id":"nm0232219","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Cannes Film Festival 1972","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Technical Grand Prize","categories":[{"category":"","names":[{"name":"Federico Fellini","id":"nm0000019","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"French Syndicate of Cinema Critics 1973","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Critics Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Foreign Film","names":[{"name":"Federico Fellini","id":"nm0000019","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists 1973","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Silver Ribbon","categories":[{"category":"Best Production Design (Migliore Scenografia)","names":[{"name":"Danilo Donati","id":"nm0232219","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Costume Design (Migliori Costumi)","names":[{"name":"Danilo Donati","id":"nm0232219","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"9,119","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0021383","name":"Ultra Film"},{"idCompany":"co0026336","name":"Les Productions Artistes Associés"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["city","brothel","fashion show","cinema","memory","trip","grotesque","satire","cult film","riot","student protest","police force","boxing match","writer","musician","decoration","catholic","religion","cardinal the priest","panties","bra","soldier","hippie","fresco","archeology","underground tunnel","siren","bomb","air raid","fred astaire","tap dancing","heckler","theatre","comedian","dancer","tour bus","colosseum","demonstration","protestor","road accident","ruins","flare gun","director cameo","film crew","food","singer","pasta","actor","prostitute","film within a film","slide show","classroom","benito mussolini","stage play","julius caesar","voice over narration","italian history","surrealism","biker","nonlinear timeline","flashback","drug use","church","beatnik","female nudity","semi autobiographical","rome italy","cult director","ancient art","1970s","1930s","fake documentary","priest","pope","orgy","nudity","catholic church"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 03:05:22"}}
