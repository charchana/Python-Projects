Once in Brazil he gets in a few tangles with the locals and manages to secure a ride on a charter flight deep into Amazonia. All hell breaks loose as the plane crashes deep in the heart of the jungle, leaving Sopkiw, megalomaniac Soares, and a bunch of super models on their own to trek back to society. The group runs into cannibals, quick sand, murderous animals, and a renegade mine run by slave owners.","simplePlot":"A plane crashes in the Amazon jungle, and its passengers must battle their way through cannibals, slave traders, wild animals and murderous piranha fish to safety.","actors":[{"actorName":"Michael Sopkiw","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814679","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1954","placeOfBirth":" Connecticut, USA","bio":"Although his moment in the acting spotlight was regrettably fleeting, Michael Sopkiw did nonetheless prove to be a delightfully sincere, spirited and enthusiastic asset in the four enjoyably low-rent mid-80s Italian exploitation features he starred in. Born in 1954 in Connecticut, the handsome and engaging Sopkiw worked as a merchant sailor laying submarine detection cable in the North Sea in England in the 70s. He eventually began sailing yachts and later ships after spending a year in college in Miami, Florida. Michael was arrested by the DEA for shipping marijuana and served one year of a two and a half year prison sentence. Following being paroled from jail in the late 70s, he studied acting in New York City and then worked for a short spell as a catwalk and photographic model in Europe. Sopkiw made his film debut with a substantial lead part as rugged Snake Plissken-like survivalist warrior hero Parsifal in the immensely fun'n'funky post-nuke sci-fi/action romp \"2019: After the Fall of New York\" (1983). Sopkiw next appeared in two movies for director Lamberto Bava: he's tough ex-cop turned convicted murderer Jake \"Tiger\" Sharp in the exciting \"Blastfighter\" (1984) and dashing hunk Peter in the deliciously cheesy \"Jaws\" rip-off \"Devilfish\" (1984). Sopkiw concluded his acting career with a lively turn as scruffy bargain basement Indiana Jones-style adventurer Kevin Hall in the terrifically trashy \"Massacre in Dinosaur Valley\" (1985). After calling it a day as an actor, Michael Sopkiw went on to study medicinal plant science and launched Miron Violet Glass, a California-based company which makes special glass bottles that protect plants from the sun.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814679","name":"Michael Sopkiw","idIMDB":"nm0814679"},"actorId":"nm0814679","character":"Kevin Hall","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Suzane Carvalho","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0142495","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 December 1963","placeOfBirth":" Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","bio":"Gorgeous and voluptuous brunette knockout Suzane Carvalho was born on December 26, 1963 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
