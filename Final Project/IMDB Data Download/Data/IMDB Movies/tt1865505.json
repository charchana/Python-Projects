From a very young age, he loved to learn, especially reading classical text in and outside the classroom. He took great attention to Irish play writers such as Samuel Beckett, which eventually led to him performing in his high school play production of \"Waiting for Godot\", and paying great attention to detail in his high school drama classes. Upon finishing 12th grade, he spent a couple of years with the Dublin Shakespeare Festival, and under the advice of a director there, headed across to London and auditioned for drama schools. Soon to follow, he was invited to audition for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avon, and spent a couple of seasons back in England on the stage. He then, at the age of thirty five, decided to audition for films in the UK and began to build a very respectable resume playing many different diverse characters. He made his debut as a quarryman in The Field (1990). He had several small roles in major Hollywood movies based in Ireland, such as Far and Away (1992) and Le cheval venu de la mer (1992). Memorably played historical Irish figure \"Michael Collins\" in The Treaty (1991). Made his breakthrough in Scottish themed Braveheart (1995), which was largely filmed in Ireland, opposite Mel Gibson. He played Gibson's right-hand man \"Hamish\". Since then, he has appeared in numerous major films such as Mission: Impossible II (2000), Lake Placid (1999), Turbulence (1997). He has made a name for himself taking the titular role in The General (1998), based on the life of Irish criminal \"Martin Cahill\", for which he won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award. He appears in director John Boorman's film The Tailor of Panama (2001) as well as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). Ever since, he has continued to bring his huge stage presence to the screen, always delivering the character in full development to his audience. He is married to his lovely wife, Mary, since 1982. They have four sons.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3NTMxODI0OTBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ1NTY5Mjc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322407","name":"Brendan Gleeson","idIMDB":"nm0322407"},"actorId":"nm0322407","character":"Conor / Mac Lir","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0515867","main":true},{"actorName":"Lisa Hannigan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1907066","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 February 1981","placeOfBirth":" County Meath, Ireland","birthName":"Lisa Margaret Hannigan","bio":"Lisa Hannigan was born on February 12, 1981 in County Meath, Ireland as Lisa Margaret Hannigan.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1907066","name":"Lisa Hannigan","idIMDB":"nm1907066"},"actorId":"nm1907066","character":"Bronach","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fionnula Flanagan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001217","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYzMDAzNjQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTYxNDU4NzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 December 1941","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","birthName":"Fionnghuala Flanagan","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Fionnula Flanagan was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. From an early age she grew up speaking both English and Irish on a daily basis. Her parents weren't native Irish speakers but wanted Fionnula and her four siblings to learn the language. Her mother used to say, \"A nation without a language is a nation without a soul\". Fionnula has said she will be forever grateful to them for that. She was educated at the Abbey Theatre School in Dublin and in Switzerland. She moved to Los Angeles in 1968 and lives with her husband, psychiatrist Dr. Garrett O'Connor, in Beverly Hills. Of her enormous body of work, including stage, television and film, she might be most well-known for James Joyce's Women (1985), in which she plays six different women who had a profound influence on James Joyce's life. Besides giving an award-winning performance, she also wrote, adapted and produced the piece for the stage, and subsequently as a feature film. She believes Joyce is the most important writer in the English language, most notably for \"Ulysses\", \"Finnegan's Wake\" and \"The Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\". When she was growing up she thought the much lauded author was a good friend of her parents, because they were always saying, \"Joyce said this, Joyce said that\". When she was finally old enough to read Joyce for herself, the characters were like old friends.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjYzMDAzNjQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTYxNDU4NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001217","name":"Fionnula Flanagan","idIMDB":"nm0001217"},"actorId":"nm0001217","character":"Granny / Macha","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0516523","main":true},{"actorName":"Lucy O'Connell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7057541","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NzE0MTkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NzU1NTE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Lucy O'Connell is an actress, known for Le chant de la mer (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NzE0MTkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NzU1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7057541","name":"Lucy O'Connell","idIMDB":"nm7057541"},"actorId":"nm7057541","character":"Saoirse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0515492","main":true},{"actorName":"Jon Kenny","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448587","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1957","placeOfBirth":" Hospital, Co.
