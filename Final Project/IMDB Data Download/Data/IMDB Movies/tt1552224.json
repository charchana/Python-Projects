He is of Italian (father) and Polish, German, and English (mother) descent. Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s. Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career. His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984). In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage (b.1992). In 2004, he married Alice Kim Cage, with whom he has a son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDM4Nzk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwNjExOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115","name":"Nicolas Cage","nicknames":["Nick"],"idIMDB":"nm0000115"},"actorId":"nm0000115","character":"Gallain","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0488367","main":true},{"actorName":"Kahina Carina","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2162501","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kahina Carina is an actress and director, known for Croisades (2014), Braqueurs (2015) and Gibraltar (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2162501","name":"Kahina Carina","idIMDB":"nm2162501"},"actorId":"nm2162501","character":"Moor's Wife","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Simon Chin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1777809","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNTU3NDI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQxMTQxMDI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 February 1975","placeOfBirth":" Montreal, Quebec, Canada","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Simon was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada but his family moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan when he was a year old.

His parents, Alie and David Christensen, are in the communications business. He is of Danish (father) and Swedish and Italian (mother) descent. Hayden grew up in Markham, Ontario, with siblings Kaylen, Hejsa, and Tove. Hayden set out to become an actor when a chance encounter at the age of eight placed him in his first commercial, for Pringles. When he was thirteen, he had starring roles in several dramatic television series. His biggest break was a major part in the Fox Family Network's Coeurs rebelles (2000). On the series, Hayden showed off his acting talent as a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and turns to drugs in despair. Later, he appeared in the television movie Trapped in a Purple Haze (2000), where he co-starred with his friend Jonathan Jackson. Hayden also had a role in the film The Virgin Suicides (1999). On May 12, 2000, it was announced that Christensen would star as Anakin Skywalker in the prequels Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). The star was chosen by director George Lucas because he felt that Hayden had raw talent and good chemistry with actress Natalie Portman. Lucas stunned the movie world by picking the then-unknown actor after he had turned down such big names as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonathan Jackson, as well as 400 other candidates. His role as the troubled, misunderstood teenager Sam Monroe in Irwin Winkler's Life as a House (2001) won him 'Breakthrough Performance of the Year' from the National Board of Review. The film also placed him as a nominee for 'Best Supporting Actor' at both the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Hayden then starred in Shattered Glass (2003), quoted by some of the real Stephen Glass' colleagues as giving an eerie and uncanny portrayal. Since his Star Wars days, Hayden has headlined several action films, including Jumper (2008) and Takers (2010). When not working, he enjoys spending quality time with his family (such as big brother Tove), hanging out with his friends, and exploring other hobbies such as the blues, jazz and piano. Hayden has been in a relationship with actress Rachel Bilson for many years. The two have a child, born in 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5Mzc3NzM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI0NTI4NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0159789","name":"Hayden Christensen","nicknames":["Den","H"],"idIMDB":"nm0159789"},"actorId":"nm0159789","character":"Jacob","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0507613","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Philip Clark","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4975017","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzUwOTcwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg5OTkzNjE@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Born in England but raised in Portugal, Paul began martial arts at the age of twelve, taking karate lessons and kickboxing. Inspired by the martial arts stars of the 90's like Jackie Chan and Jean Claude Van Damme, Paul decided to take his training more seriously, and so at the age of nineteen he moved to China to study Wushu at the Beijing Sports University. There he enrolled in a two year program where he studied the disciplines of long fist, saber, staff, straight sword and spear. Having dreams of working in the movies, he found that China offered many opportunities and soon found work in commercials and TV shows. Over ten years later Paul is still in China and is now working as a full time actor. Through the years he's been fortunate enough to work with many top names in the film business, including Sammo Hung, Michelle Yeoh, Dolph Lundgren, Ziyi Zhang, Andy Lau and the rising martial arts star Scott Adkins. But perhaps the greatest honor for Paul was fighting his childhood hero Jackie Chan in the Chinese Zodiac. Paul is based in Beijing where he continues to pursue his passion for martial arts and film making.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzUwOTcwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg5OTkzNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4975017","name":"Paul Philip Clark","idIMDB":"nm4975017"},"actorId":"nm4975017","character":"Crusader B","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anoja Dias Bolt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1785158","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Anoja Dias Bolt is an actress, known for Croisades (2014), Easy (2003) and Tom's Nu Heaven (2005).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1785158","name":"Anoja Dias Bolt","idIMDB":"nm1785158"},"actorId":"nm1785158","character":"Anika","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jawed El Berni","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4402227","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJjZmM0ODktODNmMS00YmMwLThiM2MtMTFiMDRiNzNjMzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Jawed El Berni is an actor, director, stuntman, fight choreographer and martial artist.
