Born and raised in Texas, Lamkin was drawn to performing through her school choir. She continued acting at Texas Women's University before eventually settling in Houston. Many people encouraged Kathy on her artistic journey -- while performing with a traveling theater company, owner Barbara Jenkins mentored Kathy making the transition from stage to film; subsequently, Jo Edna Boldin became one of the first casting directors to recognize her unique talent and cast Kathy in films. While in Texas, she remained active in commercials and theatre, and ran her own company, Unicorn School of Acting and later the performing wing, USA Theatre. At the urging of casting director Terry Berland and agent Kristene Wallis, Lamkin made the move to Los Angeles in 2002. Her first TV role in Hollywood was on \"Malcolm in the Middle\", opposite Jane Kaczmarek. She was extremely grateful to Jane for calling attention to the fact they needed turn around for her close ups. Memorable guest star roles-such as in \"Nip/Tuck\", where she was required to wear a 200-pound fat suit and the aforementioned \"Tea Lady\"-followed, leading to a recent run of high-profile screen roles in films such as: In the Valley of Elah, The Heartbreak Kid, and No Country for Old Men, where she's the only character to stand up to Javier Bardem's psychotic killer and live. Kathy's first screen kiss came from Ben Stiller in The Heartbreak Kid; unfortunately, it didn't make the final cut of the film. Kathy's daughter Kati is a film editor in Los Angeles and her son Greg is a police officer, married with two young children. Her husband, Steve, encourages her while working as an aerospace engineer at NASA. Kathy's father was an oil field wildcatter (exploring for undiscovered oil) and her mother was an artist and business woman.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNjY3NjQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzc0Mjgy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0483541","name":"Kathy Lamkin","idIMDB":"nm0483541"},"actorId":"nm0483541","character":"Louise Staunton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cristen Coppen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0178790","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MTI0MTQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwOTQxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Cristen Coppenbarger","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Cristen Coppen was born in Jacksonville, Florida, USA as Cristen Coppenbarger.

She survived the awkward glasses/braces/acne years thanks in large part to a healthy sense of humor and the ability to laugh at herself. She then went on to study at the University of Missouri, where she majored in Journalism and minored in having a marvelous college experience. She even spent a semester living/studying in London where she fell in love with collecting stamps in her passport. Once back, she agreed to amuse her friends, against her parents' wishes, by entering a pageant. As they announced her name as the winner of first the Miss Junior Missouri, and a few weeks later, the Miss Junior America title one could clearly hear her father exclaim, \"WHAT?!\" from the audience. However, he was less shocked that she managed to parlay the win into an internship for an acting coach in NYC who was one of the judges. It was during that internship that the pursuit of acting as a profession became less of the pipe dream it had seemed to her in Missouri. She took up internships with a talent agency, casting director, and an advertising agency, determined to learn the business side of all things film. During these NYC years she began to study under acclaimed acting coach, Susan Batson and really got to raise her own bar. Susan called one rainy January Wednesday and told Paula that she had to get to LA for an audition that Friday. This was the catalyst she needed, and after weeks of callbacks and hustling up meetings, Paula had decided that she needed to learn to drive again and make the move to the West Coast permanent. It turned out to be a good decision, as since arriving she's been able to pay her bills doing what she loves. You can now see her in films, on TV, popular web series, in over a dozen national commercials, hear her voice in cartoons, and see her producing skills at work in multiple productions.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNjU5MDMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYyOTUxMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1955206","name":"Paula Rhodes","idIMDB":"nm1955206"},"actorId":"nm1955206","character":"Trish","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlie Bodin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1835107","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDgzNjI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMTU2OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Charlie Bodin is an actor and composer, known for Transformers (2007), Insurgent (2015) and Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse (2012).

A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, George Cameron Romero was born the son of legendary director, George A. Romero (\"Night of the Living Dead,\" \"The Dark Half\") and after attending Thiel College in Pennsylvania, Romero spent several years moving around the country and working crew jobs on location-based films of all sizes, until he took a break to join the dotcom boom and explore the world of advertising and creative brand strategy. After developing a reputation for delivering impossible results at half the cost of his competitions, Romero's agency caught the attention of a direct marketing company, whose owners bought Romero's agency and creative staff and introduced his fringe style to Fortune 500 clients. Shortly after, Romero's paths had culminated into one when his vision for a brick and mortar motion picture studio in Western Pennsylvania was realized and the doors to Batpack Studios opened in 2004. During his time at the head of Batpack Studios, Cameron directed two feature films, developed over 80 creative online marketing strategies and campaigns for Fortune 500 companies, directed over 100 commercials for companies like Verizon, Verizon Wireless, The Lending Tree, Cracker Barrel, and Sony Electronics, to name a few, and he worked to give independent, young filmmakers a place to call home. Romero has since set off on his own path and has developed and produced a handful of projects on his own under his new moniker, Films Used to be Dangerous, LLC d.b.a. Romero Pictures. He is also responsible for his Direct-to-Audience (D2A) Production Program that allows fans to invest directly in his films and enjoy any profit that Romero's D2A projects may make by being treated as direct investors in his films. romeropictures.com . #filmisfearless . #filmsusedtobedangerous","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDg2NjM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAzNTU4ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0739410","name":"George Cameron Romero","idIMDB":"nm0739410"},"actorId":"nm0739410","character":"Telephone Customer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1118693","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1118693","business":{"budget":{"money":"$750,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"07","month":"05","year":"2007","remarks":null},"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"22","month":"10","year":"2007","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"18","month":"11","year":"2007","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":"Staunton Films, LLC"},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 30 min (90 min) (USA)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":["Arriflex Cameras and Lenses"],"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["Super 16"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"3.7","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"1,067","type":"Video","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0422483","name":"Romero Pictures"},{"idCompany":"co0198298","name":"Batpack Studios"},{"idCompany":"co0180101","name":"Psycho Rock Productions"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["virginia","cruelty","sadism","killing","psycho killer","nudity","female nudity","filming a movie","watching a movie","multiple stabbings","looking at the camera","blood spatter","walking cane","video camera","truck driver","tied to a table","throat slitting","talking to the camera","stabbed to death","stabbed in the shoulder","slaughterhouse","shotgun","severed foot","road trip","punched in the face","psychopath","pig","pickup truck","peeling skin","oxygen tank","needle","murder","movie camera","mother son relationship","knocked out","knocked out with a gun butt","knife","junkyard","intestines","interview","impalement","hitchhiker","hit with a tire iron","hit with a shovel","hit with a hammer","hiding under hay","held at gunpoint","heart shaped box","hair pulling","gore","girl in bra and panties","foot blown off","flashback","fat woman","electrocution","electric fence","dripping blood","double barreled shotgun","doll","dismemberment","death","cut hand","cross","covered in blood","country house","corpse","coroner","cigarette smoking","chase","car trouble","boyfriend girlfriend relationship","blood","barn","barbed wire","autumn leaves","autopsy","achilles tendon cut","abandoned mill"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/13 06:28:27"}}
