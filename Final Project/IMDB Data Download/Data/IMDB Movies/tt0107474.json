He was a university professor until an air raid, when he left to become a writer and has to live in a hut. His mood has hardly changed, not by the change nor by time. Every year his students celebrate his birthday, issuing the question \"Mahda kai?\" (not yet?), just to hear Uehida-san's answer \"Madada yo!\" (No, not yet!), in a ritual of self affirmation, and desires of lasting forever. It's a very \"japanese\" film who portrays everyday life and customs in Japan.","simplePlot":"Following World War II, a retired professor approaching his autumn years finds his quality of life drastically reduced in war-torn Tokyo. Denying despair, he pursues writing and celebrates his birthday with his adoring students.","actors":[{"actorName":"Tatsuo Matsumura","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0559581","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 December 1914","placeOfBirth":" Kanagawa, Japan","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Tatsuo Matsumura was born on December 18, 1914 in Kanagawa, Japan.
