Trained for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art she first married and lived overseas in Argentina for nearly eight years. Upon her return she made her initial stage appearance in \"The Constant Flirt\" in 1926. In the 30s she found her way onto the screen, taking many of her delightful theatre roles to film, including Line Engaged (1935), Night Must Fall (1937) (probably her most noteworthy), and Who Is Guilty? (1939). She added immeasurable Dickensian flavor as various maids and mums to such classics as Oliver Twist (1948), A Christmas Carol (1951) and The Pickwick Papers (1952). She was also openly received as Mrs. Huggett in the \"Huggett Family\" series that ran a few years in the late 40s. In her five decade career, Kathleen 'toiled' as various servile characters in nearly 80 films. As popular in England as similar 'working class' as character player Thelma Ritter was in America, Kathleen also enjoyed a slight shot of TV popularity late in her career, notably in the brief series Mrs Thursday (1966) as a cleaning lady who inherits her boss's vast fortune. Kathleen's last years were spent in a nursing home, living to the ripe old age of 103.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365692","name":"Kathleen Harrison","idIMDB":"nm0365692"},"actorId":"nm0365692","character":"Mrs. Dilber","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000665","main":true},{"actorName":"Mervyn Johns","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424345","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 February 1899","placeOfBirth":" Pembroke, Wales, UK","birthName":"David Mervyn Johns","bio":"Mervyn Johns was born on February 18, 1899 in Pembroke, Wales as David Mervyn Johns.

She was the youngest of four sisters - including Angela Baddeley, also an actress - and her half-brother, Very Rev William Baddeley, was a Church of England Minister. Not much is known about Baddeley's early life. She made her stage debut in 1918, and became popular in London stage comedies and revues prior to World War II, known for her dancing talent and natural comic ability. She memorably performed several times with Hermione Gingold. Baddeley made her film debut in 1927, with a role in the extremely obscure silent comedy A Daughter in Revolt (1927), but didn't come to attention until twenty years later, when she portrayed the affable but blowzy Ida in the film noir Brighton Rock (1947). Known for her memorable character roles, Baddeley dabbled in such movies as Passport to Pimlico (1949), A Christmas Carol (1951), Tom Brown's Schooldays (1951), The Pickwick Papers (1952), The Belles of St. Trinian's (1954), Mary Poppins (1964), and The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her acid-tongued performance in Room at the Top (1959). At two minutes and thirty-two seconds, it is the shortest performance to ever be nominated for the award. Baddeley became a household favorite for her role as irritable cockney housekeeper Mrs. Naugatuck on the '70s comedy series Maude (1972). She landed guest spots on multiple other shows, including but not limited to Hancock's Half Hour (1956), The Patty Duke Show (1963), Bewitched (1964), Night Gallery (1969), The Bionic Woman (1976), The Love Boat (1977), Charlie's Angels (1976), Wonder Woman (1975), Fantasy Island (1977), and Magnum, P.I. (1980). Baddeley's two marriages failed, and she had a daughter, Pauline Tennant, from her first. She was in a long-term relationship with actor Laurence Harvey until he left her for Margaret Leighton, and died on August 19, 1986 at the age of 79 following a series of strokes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUwNzc4MjMwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcwMTM0MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0045968","name":"Hermione Baddeley","idIMDB":"nm0045968"},"actorId":"nm0045968","character":"Mrs. Cratchit","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000641","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Hordern","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0394588","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNTc4NzA3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYxMTExOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 October 1911","placeOfBirth":" Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England, UK","birthName":"Michael Murray Hordern","bio":"Following a brief teaching career, Michael Hordern made his stage debut in 1937.

For many, he will perhaps be best remembered for playing one of the most endearing characters of recent times on British television, \"Arthur Daley\", the shifty but very likable \"business man\" in the hit ITV drama series, Minder (1979). However, Cole had long been a household name well before \"Minder\" aired on television. His successful film career began in the 1940s, appearing with Alastair Sim and Sir John Mills in the film Bombsight Stolen (1941). Further success came throughout the 1950s and 1960s, where he played the part of \"Flash Harry\" in the popular \"St Trinians\" films, alongside his close friend and mentor, Alastair Sim. By 1963, Hollywood had recognized the talents of Cole and he was cast in the iconic film, Cleopatra (1963), starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Rex Harrison. During the 1970s, George continued to star in films and television programmes, becoming a regular and sought after actor. It is interesting to note that, in 1971, he appeared with Dennis Waterman (who would later become his Minder (1979) co-star) in the horror film, Fright (1971). In 1979, Cole was cast as the hapless \"Arthur Daley\", a self-professed entrepreneur in the ITV drama Minder (1979), a role he played until 1994. The role showcased Cole's acting prowess and brought him to the attention of a younger audience. As well as starring in Minder (1979), George continued with other projects in film and television, including Root Into Europe (1992), An Independent Man (1995), Mary Reilly (1996), Dad (1997) and, since 2000, in Station Jim (2001), Bodily Harm (2002) and, alongside his good friend Dennis Waterman, in the BBC hit drama, New Tricks (2003). He has also starred in several stage productions. It is hoped that Cole will not be be remembered simply for portraying \"Arthur Daley\", but instead for being one of Britain's most enduring actors, one of only a handful of actors who can claim to have had a 60-year career and for being an extremely likable, charismatic man.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyOTQyNjE5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIyNDIzMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0170552","name":"George Cole","idIMDB":"nm0170552"},"actorId":"nm0170552","character":"Young Ebenezer Scrooge","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000500","main":true},{"actorName":"John Charlesworth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0153205","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 November 1935","placeOfBirth":" Hull, England, UK","bio":"John Charlesworth was born on November 12, 1935 in Hull, England.

Born in Croydon in Surrey, he attended Brighton College in Sussex before studying at Cambridge University with the intention of becoming a schoolmaster. However, he opted instead for the stage and went into repertory theatre in Liverpool and then onto the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. He wrote his first play in 1913 and, in contrast to the characters he often portrayed on screen, held socially progressive views which were often reflected in his work. His output included two plays about the First World War, \"D Company\" and \"Black Eill\", and one about the Tolpuddle Martyrs. He also worked as a screenwriter on two documentaries for Paul Rotha, Land of Promise (1946) and \"World of Plenty\". His most prolific period as a screenwriter was in the 1930s and 1940s, initially on historical subjects like Nell Gwyn (1934), Rhodes (1936), and Victoria the Great (1937). In many of these films he also began appearing in supporting roles, and from the mid-'30s onwards he found himself in increasing demand as an actor as well as a writer. Over the next 30 years he appeared in nearly 100 films, featuring in everything from Alfred Hitchcock thrillers and Ealing comedies to Hammer horrors. Usually cast as a befuddled judge or a doddering old doctor, academic or other local eccentric, he first caught audiences' imagination as the hearse driver in the Ealing chiller compendium Dead of Night (1945), after which he began to get bigger and better parts. He was particularly memorable as the philosophical hangman in Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), Canon Chasuble in The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), Dr. McAdam in Folly to Be Wise (1952), the barrister Grimes in Brothers in Law (1957) and as Windrush Sr. in Private's Progress (1956) and I'm All Right Jack (1959). Towards the end of his career he continued to appear in cameo roles in comedy films, and made several appearances in Hammer horror films including Horror of Dracula (1958) and The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), before failing eyesight forced him into retirement in his late 70s.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0539942","name":"Miles Malleson","idIMDB":"nm0539942"},"actorId":"nm0539942","character":"Old Joe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000657","main":true},{"actorName":"Ernest Thesiger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857658","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE1Mjg0NTk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg0NTQ3MTE@._V1_UY44_CR12,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 January 1879","placeOfBirth":" Chelsea, London, England, UK","birthName":"Ernest Frederic Graham Thesiger","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Although he made nearly 60 films in a 50-year acting career, it is for the two he made with director James Whale that Ernest Thesiger will be best remembered. Born Ernest Frederic Graham Thesiger in London on January 15, 1879, he was the grandson of the first Baron of Chelmsford. Educated at Marlbrough college and the Slade, he originally hoped to become a great painter. Greatness proved elusive, however (though he remained an accomplished watercolour artist), and he quickly turned to the theatre, making his first appearance on stage in a production of \"Colonel Smith\" in 1909. He put his career on hold when, in 1914, he enlisted as a private in the British army when World War I broke out (he originally hoped to join a Scottish regiment because he wanted to wear a kilt). He did see some action in the trenches but had to be sent home after being wounded (he was quoted afterwards as saying of these experiences, \"My dear, the noise! And the people!\"). He made his first film appearance in 1916 with The Real Thing at Last (1916) and then returned to the theatre with \"A Little Bit of Fluff\",' which ran for over 1200 performances and led to him appearing in a film adaptation (A Little Bit of Fluff (1919)). In 1925 he appeared in Noël Coward's production of \"On With the Dance\", in which he got to show off his knack for camp performances by playing one of two elderly women sharing a boarding house. In the early 1930s his old friend, actor-turned-director James Whale (who had moved to Hollywood and was enjoying huge success with Frankenstein (1931)), requested that his friend join him there to play the role of Horace Femm in Whale's upcoming production of The Old Dark House (1932). Thesiger agreed and, along with co-star Eva Moore, stole the film, which became a huge success. He returned to Britain to make The Ghoul (1933) with Boris Karloff. Whale requested Thesiger's services in Hollywood again, this time to appear in his sequel to Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935). Thesiger was given the role of the sinister Dr. Pretorious, after Whale had refused the studio's suggestion of Claude Rains for the role. With help from Whale's direction, some classic dialogue (\"Have some gin. It's my only weakness . . .\", \"To a new world of gods and monsters\") and expert camera work (which helped accentuate his skeletal frame), Thesiger stole the show once more. He returned to Britain and, unfortunately, never worked with Whale again. He appeared in the Alexander Korda-produced The Man Who Could Work Miracles (1936) and had a memorable role in the tongue-in-cheek horror film They Drive by Night (1938). He appeared with Will Hay in My Learned Friend (1943) and Don't Take It to Heart! (1944). His other notable films of the 1940s include Henry V (1944) and The Winslow Boy (1948). He returned briefly to America to appear in \"As You Like It\" on Broadway and afterwards divided his time between theatre and film. Notable later films include Last Holiday (1950) (as Sir Trevor Lampington, discoverer and eponym of Lampington's disease), Laughter in Paradise (1951), A Christmas Carol (1951) and The Man in the White Suit (1951) (as an elderly industry magnate). He made his last film appearance in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961) and his last stage performance, opposite Sirs Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, in a production of \"The Last Joke\". He passed away shortly afterwards, on the eve of his 82nd birthday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE1Mjg0NTk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg0NTQ3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857658","name":"Ernest Thesiger","idIMDB":"nm0857658"},"actorId":"nm0857658","character":"The Undertaker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0171565","main":true},{"actorName":"Glyn Dearman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0213173","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 December 1939","placeOfBirth":" Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England, UK","birthName":"Glyn John Dearman","bio":"Glyn Dearman was born on December 30, 1939 in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England as Glyn John Dearman.
