He was born in Lauban, Silesia, Germany (later became Luban, Poland). He moved to Australia, where he was educated in Sydney at the Fort Street High School. On the steps of the Sydney War Memorial, Helmut participated in a school production of Hamlet as the title character and as such made an incredibly strong impression with his shockingly mature portrayal. Among the numerous television series appearances, films and shorts to his credit, Helmut Bakaitis is best known to most audiences (especially western) for his portrayal as the character known as The Architect in the cult science fiction films The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). In both these sequels to the 1999 predecessor The Matrix, Helmut artfully portrays The Architect as an analytical and perhaps emotionless genius who created the virtual world of The Matrix, whose memorable and informative speech in the film at last shed light to the truth behind the Matrix's creation and the purpose of The One, (played by Keanu Reeves as Neo) who must make a choice to save the human race from systematic extinction. In addition to his famed Matrix role, Helmut has appeared also in the movie Happy Feet (2006) before again contributing his talents to several film shorts.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgxNjMxNTIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTE3OTYy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048127","name":"Helmut Bakaitis","idIMDB":"nm0048127"},"actorId":"nm0048127","character":"The Architect","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000770","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Bastoni","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0060561","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjk0MTkwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDMzNzky._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 March 1966","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Steve Bastoni is one of Australia's most versatile and respected actors, he has a string of impressive credits to his name including the Emmy award winning On the Beach, Matrix Reloaded and the Water Diviner to name a few.
