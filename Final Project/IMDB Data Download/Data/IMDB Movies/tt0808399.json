His parents, Alie and David Christensen, are in the communications business. He is of Danish (father) and Swedish and Italian (mother) descent. Hayden grew up in Markham, Ontario, with siblings Kaylen, Hejsa, and Tove. Hayden set out to become an actor when a chance encounter at the age of eight placed him in his first commercial, for Pringles. When he was thirteen, he had starring roles in several dramatic television series. His biggest break was a major part in the Fox Family Network's Coeurs rebelles (2000). On the series, Hayden showed off his acting talent as a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and turns to drugs in despair. Later, he appeared in the television movie Trapped in a Purple Haze (2000), where he co-starred with his friend Jonathan Jackson. Hayden also had a role in the film The Virgin Suicides (1999). On May 12, 2000, it was announced that Christensen would star as Anakin Skywalker in the prequels Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). The star was chosen by director George Lucas because he felt that Hayden had raw talent and good chemistry with actress Natalie Portman. Lucas stunned the movie world by picking the then-unknown actor after he had turned down such big names as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonathan Jackson, as well as 400 other candidates. His role as the troubled, misunderstood teenager Sam Monroe in Irwin Winkler's Life as a House (2001) won him 'Breakthrough Performance of the Year' from the National Board of Review. The film also placed him as a nominee for 'Best Supporting Actor' at both the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Hayden then starred in Shattered Glass (2003), quoted by some of the real Stephen Glass' colleagues as giving an eerie and uncanny portrayal. Since his Star Wars days, Hayden has headlined several action films, including Jumper (2008) and Takers (2010). When not working, he enjoys spending quality time with his family (such as big brother Tove), hanging out with his friends, and exploring other hobbies such as the blues, jazz and piano. Hayden has been in a relationship with actress Rachel Bilson for many years. The two have a child, born in 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5Mzc3NzM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI0NTI4NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0159789","name":"Hayden Christensen","nicknames":["Den","H"],"idIMDB":"nm0159789"},"actorId":"nm0159789","character":"Ben","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Andy Garcia","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000412","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3NDA5NTgxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU3NDc4NDE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1956","placeOfBirth":" Havana, Cuba","birthName":"Andrés Arturo García Menéndez","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"One of Hollywood's most private and guarded leading men, Andy Garcia has created a few iconic characters while at the same time staying true to his acting roots and personal projects. Garcia was born Andrés Arturo García Menéndez on April 12, 1956, in Havana, Cuba, to Amelie Menéndez, a teacher of English, and René García Núñez, an attorney and avocado farmer. Garcia's family was relatively affluent. However, when he was two years old, Fidel Castro came to power, and the family fled to Miami Beach. Forced to work menial jobs for a while, the family started a fragrance company that was eventually worth more than a million dollars. He attended Natilus Junior High School and later at Miami Beach Senior High School. Andy was a popular student in school, a good basketball player and good-looking. He dreamed of playing professional baseball. In his senior year, though, he contracted mononucleosis and hepatitis, and unable to play sports, he turned his attention to acting. He studied acting with Jay W. Jensen. Jensen was a South Florida legend, counting among his numerous students, Brett Ratner, Roy Firestone, Mickey Rourke, and Luther Campbell. Following his positive high school experiences in acting, he continued his drama studies at Florida International University. Soon, he was headed out to Hollywood. His first break came as a gang member on the very first episode of the popular TV series Hill Street Blues (1981). His role as a cocaine kingpin in 8 Million Ways to Die (1986) put him on the radar of Brian De Palma, who was casting for his gangster classic The Untouchables (1987). At first, he envisioned Garcia as Al Capone's sadistic henchman Frank Nitti, but fearing typecasting as a gangster, Garcia campaigned for the role of \"George Stone\", the Italian cop who gets accepted into Eliot Ness' famous band of lawmen. Garcia's next notable role came in Black Rain (1989) by acclaimed director Ridley Scott, as the partner of police detective Michael Douglas. He then co-starred with Richard Gere in Internal Affairs (1990), directed by Mike Figgis. In 1989, Francis Ford Coppola was casting for the highly anticipated third installment of his \"Godfather\" films. The Godfather: Part III (1990) included one of the most sought-after roles in decades, the hot-headed son of \"Sonny Corleone\" and mob protégé of \"Michael Corloene\", \"Vincent Mancini\". A plum role for any young rising star, the role was campaigned for by a host of actors. Val Kilmer, Alec Baldwin, Vincent Spano, Charlie Sheen, and even Robert De Niro (who wanted the role changed to accommodate his age) were all beaten out by the up-and-coming Garcia. His performance was Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actor, and secured him international stardom and a place in cinematic history. Now a leading man, he starred in such films as Jennifer 8 (1992) and Hero (1992). He won raves for his role as the husband of Meg Ryan in When a Man Loves a Woman (1994) and gave another charismatic gangster turn in Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995). He then returned in Night Falls on Manhattan (1996), directed by Sidney Lumet, as well as portraying legendary mobster Lucky Luciano in Hoodlum (1997). In perhaps his most mainstream role, he portrayed a cop in the action film Desperate Measures (1998). Garcia then starred in a few lower-profile projects that didn't do much for his career, but things turned around in 2001, with the first of many projects being his role as a cold casino owner in Ocean's Eleven (2001), directed by Steven Soderbergh. Seeing his removal from Cuba as involuntary, Garcia is proud of his heritage which influences his life and work. One such case is his portrayal of renowned Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval in For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story (2000). He is an extremely private man, and strong believer in old-fashioned chivalry. Married to his wife, Maria Victoria, since 1982, the couple has three daughters. One of the most talented leading men around, Garcia has had a unique career of staying true to his own ideals and thoughts on acting. While some would have used some of the momentum he has acquired at different points in his career to get rich off lightweight projects, Garcia has stayed true to stories and films that aspire to something more. But with a presence and style that never seem old, a respect from directors and film buffs, alike, Andy Garcia will be remembered for a long time in film history.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3NDA5NTgxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU3NDc4NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000412","name":"Andy Garcia","idIMDB":"nm0000412"},"actorId":"nm0000412","character":"Garry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0240826","main":true},{"actorName":"Rachel Bilson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1377375","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NjUxNzgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc1Mjc1MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 August 1981","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Rachel Sarah Bilson","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Rachel Bilson was born in Los Angeles, to Janice (Stango), a sex therapist, and Danny Bilson.

His mother, Sonia Constance Josephine (Copeland), was born in Kolkata, India, to an English family then-resident there. The man he briefly knew as his father, Harry Bloom, was a legendary political activist who fought for civil rights in South Africa. But Harry died of a stroke when Orlando was only four years old. After that, Orlando and his older sister, Samantha Bloom, were raised by their mother and family friend, Colin Stone. When Orlando was thirteen, Sonia revealed to him that Colin is actually the biological father of Orlando and his sister; the two were conceived after an agreement by his parents, since Harry was then-unable to have children. Orlando attended St. Edmunds School in Canterbury but struggled in many courses because of dyslexia. He did embrace the arts, however, and enjoyed pottery, photography and sculpturing. He also participated in school plays and was active at his local theater. As a teen, Orlando landed his first job: he was a clay trapper at a pigeon shooting range. Encouraged by his mother, he and his sister began studying poetry and prose, eventually giving readings at Kent Festival. Orlando and Samantha won many poetry and Bible reciting competitions. Then Orlando, who always idolized larger-than-life characters, gravitated towards serious acting. At the age of 16, he moved to London and joined the National Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and gaining a scholarship to train with the British American Drama Academy. Like many young actors, he also auditioned for a number of television roles to further his career, landing bit parts in British television shows Casualty (1986), Midsomer Murders (1997) and Smack the Pony (1999). He also appeared in the critically acclaimed movie Wilde (1997). He then attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. It was there, in 1998, that Orlando fell three stories from a rooftop terrace and broke his back. Despite fears that he would be permanently paralyzed, he quickly recovered and returned to the stage. As fate would have it, seated in the audience one night in 1999 was a director named Peter Jackson. After the show, he met with Orlando and asked him to audition for his new set of movies. After graduating from Guildhall, Orlando began work on the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, spending 18 months in New Zealand bringing to life \"Legolas\", a part which made him a household name. Today, he is one of the busiest and most sought-after actors in the industry.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MDkxMjQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ3Mjc4MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089217","name":"Orlando Bloom","nicknames":["Orli","OB"],"idIMDB":"nm0089217"},"actorId":"nm0089217","character":"David","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0240829","main":true},{"actorName":"Christina Ricci","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000207","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUzMzk5NzcyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ1NjkzNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 February 1980","placeOfBirth":" Santa Monica, California, USA","height":"5' 0¼\" (1.53 m)","bio":"Precocious, outspoken child-teen starlet of the 1990s, Christina Ricci was born in 1980 in Santa Monica, California, the youngest of four children of Sarah (Murdoch), a realtor, and Ralph Ricci, a lawyer and therapist.

He attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and then transferred to the Hun School of Princeton and it was while he was there that he began taking acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus. His early ambition had been to be a writer, but as a result of the acting lessons and appearances in student productions he persuaded his mother to allow him to attend an audition for a role in a sci-fi adolescent adventure, Explorers (1985). He got the part (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for a few years. He was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society (1989) and he didn't complete his degree. His subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony nomination for his role in The Coast of Utopia at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of \"serious\" and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Training Day (2001).

He was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Russia, USSR, to a Jewish family. His parents, Irina Korina and Viktor Yelchin, were a successful pair of professional figure skaters in Leningrad, and his grandfather was also a professional sportsman, a soccer player. Anton was a six-month-old baby when he emigrated to the United States, where his parents settled in California, and eventually developed coaching careers. He demonstrated his strong personality from the early age of four, and declined his parents' tutelage in figure skating because he was fond of acting, and knew exactly what he wanted to do in his life. Yelchin attended acting classes in Los Angeles, and eventually was noticed by casting agents. In 2000, at the age of ten, he made his debut on television, appearing as Robbie Edelstein in the medical drama ER (1994). At the age of 11, he shot to fame as Bobby Garfield, co-starring opposite Anthony Hopkins in Hearts in Atlantis (2001), and earning himself the 2002 Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film as Leading Young Actor. Over the course of his acting career, Yelchin has already played roles in more than twenty feature films and television productions, including Pavel Chekov in the hugely successful franchise reboot Star Trek (2009), and its sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness (2013). Outside of his acting profession, Anton loved reading, and was also fond of playing chess. He wrote music and performed with a band, where he also played piano and guitar. Anton lived in Los Angeles, California, until his death on the evening of June 19, 2016, outside his LA home, when he accidentally left his Jeep Grand Cherokee in neutral on his steep driveway, causing it to roll backwards, pinning him against a brick pillar and security fence.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ5ODE1OTE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwMjExNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0947338","name":"Anton Yelchin","idIMDB":"nm0947338"},"actorId":"nm0947338","character":"Boy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Caan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001001","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NjkyNDQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY5NTQ0Mw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 March 1940","placeOfBirth":" The Bronx, New York, USA","birthName":"James Edmund Caan","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"A masculine and enigmatic actor whose life and movie career have had more ups and downs than the average rollercoaster and whose selection of roles has arguably derailed him from achieving true superstar status, James Caan is New York-born and bred. He was born in the Bronx, to Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, Jewish immigrants from Germany. His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed \"The Jewish Cowboy\". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions, including \"I Roam\" and \"Mandingo\". He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Red Line 7000 (1965) and the western El Dorado (1967) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in the sensitive The Rain People (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Brian's Song (1971). With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone in the Mafia epic The Godfather (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination and, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel The Godfather: Part II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Freebie and the Bean (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in The Gambler (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong lead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star \"Jonathon E\" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in Rollerball (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller The Killer Elite (1975). Unfortunately, Caan's rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either critics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976), the quasi-western Comes a Horseman (1978) and the saccharine Chapter Two (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Thief (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Kiss Me Goodbye (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving Gardens of Stone (1987). Caan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Alien Nation (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Misery (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in For the Boys (1991), another gangster in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Bottle Rocket (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996). The demand on Caan's talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included The Yards (2000), City of Ghosts (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief \"Big Ed\" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continues to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NjkyNDQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY5NTQ0Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001001","name":"James Caan","nicknames":["Jimmy"],"idIMDB":"nm0001001"},"actorId":"nm0001001","character":"Mr. Riccoli","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Olivia Thirlby","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1880888","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ2MDI4ODI0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI0NjE4ODE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 October 1986","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Olivia resides in New York City where she was born and raised.

Her mother, Elaine Lively (née McAlpin), is an acting coach and talent manager, and her father, Ernie Lively (born Ernest Wilson Brown, Jr.), is an actor and teacher. Her brother is actor Eric Lively, and her half-siblings are actors Lori Lively, Robyn Lively and Jason Lively. She followed her parents' and siblings' steps. Her first role was Trixie, the Tooth Fairy in the musical movie Sandman (1998), directed by her father. Her big break came along a few years later, though. Blake was up to finish high school when she got the co-starring role of Bridget in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005). Blake was so perfect for the role of Bridget that, with no big references or even auditioning, she landed the role. According to her, all she did was walk in and leave a photo of herself. It was clear that she was the Bridget needed. After the film, Blake went back to high school for her senior year to have the life of a regular teenager -- or a very busy regular teenager. She was class president, a cheerleader, and performed with the choir.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2Njk0NTUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE0OTgyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515116","name":"Blake
