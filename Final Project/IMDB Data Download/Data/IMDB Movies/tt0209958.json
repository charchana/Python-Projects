Unfortunately, the killer has fallen into an irreversible coma which means he cannot confess where he has taken his latest victim before she dies.

She is the middle of three musically-inclined sisters, Leslie Lopez, a homemaker, and Lynda Lopez, a DJ on New York's WKTU, a VH1 VJ, and a morning news show correspondent on New York's Channel 11. Jennifer always dreamed of being a multi-tasking superstar. Jennifer's parents, Guadalupe Rodriguez and David Lopez, were both born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, the second largest Puerto Rican city. The two were then brought to the continental United States during their childhoods and, eventually, met while living in New York City. As a child, Jennifer enjoyed a variety of musical genres, mainly Afro-Caribbean rhythms like salsa, merengue and bachata, and mainstream music like pop, hip-hop and R&B. Although she loved music, the film industry also intrigued her. Her biggest influence was the Rita Moreno musical, West Side Story (1961). At age five, Jennifer began taking singing and dancing lessons. Aside from being a budding entertainer, Jennifer was also a Catholic schoolgirl, attending eight years at an all-girls catholic high school named \"Holy Family\", located in the Bronx, before graduating from Preston High School after a four-year stay. At school, Jennifer was an amazing athlete and participated in track and field and tennis. At age eighteen, Lopez moved out of her parent's home. During this time, Lopez worked at a law firm while she took dancing jobs at night. After high school, she briefly worked in a law office. During this time, she continued dance classes at night. At 18, she left home because her mother was scared by her decision to pursue show business. Her big break came when she was offered a job as a fly girl on Fox's hit comedy, In Living Color (1990). After a two-year stay at In Living Color (1990) where actress Rosie Perez served as choreographer, Lopez then went on to dance for famed singer-actress Janet Jackson. Her first major film was Gregory Nava's My Family (1995), and her career went into over-drive when she portrayed slain Tejana singer Selena Quintanilla Perez in Selena (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0OTY3ODA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMyMzQ1NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000182","name":"Jennifer Lopez","nicknames":["J.

Radio programming, childhood books and weekend trips to the drive-in introduced her to the magical world of movies. It was not until the mid-'70s that South Africa finally got television, and the big black box in the family living room \"miraculously\" sprang to life. However, as the daughter of a ballet teacher, Musetta was no stranger to the entertainment world and debuted on stage at the age of four. Her childhood was filled with numerous dance performances including \"Giselle\", \"Coppelia\", \"The Student Prince\" and \"Showboat\", and, shortly after completing school, she qualified as a ballet teacher herself. After earning a BA in Communications and Psychology, she landed the plum job as anchor host for an MTV-like television show in South Africa. One day, a handsome visiting American, Jeff Celentano, spotted her on television, made her his bride, and whisked her off to the very place she had always dreamed of--Hollywood. Shortly after her arrival, she became part of the very world she used to host, appearing as the \"dream girl\" in more than 20 music videos for such top recording artists as Rod Stewart, Amy Grant, Tina Turner, Elton John and Chris Isaak. It was her critically acclaimed stage performance in the original South African play \"Soweto's Burning\", about the trials of an interracial friendship in that racially segregated country, that provided her transition to the big screen. Musetta has since performed in numerous feature films, including collaborating with her husband on Under the Hula Moon (1995) and Gunshy (1998). She has also worked alongside such screen veterans as Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh and Will Smith in Wild Wild West (1999), George Clooney and John Turturro in O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) and John Hurt and Louis Gossett Jr. in Monolith (1993). She's also added a slew of television credits to her arsenal, including guest appearances on the hit shows Star Trek: Voyager (1995), Stargate SG-1 (1997) and Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997). Recently Musetta made a return to the stage, combining both her dance and acting background in an extremely successful adaptation of Molière's \"The Bourgeois Gentleman\" at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMyMjYxNTAtOGFlOC00NzRlLWE0ZWQtZDEwYjJjZjI1NDhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkzNzExMA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0888727","name":"Musetta Vander","idIMDB":"nm0888727"},"actorId":"nm0888727","character":"Ella Baines","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0160917","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Bauchau","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000872","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MDM4MjczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAxNzQ4MzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 December 1938","placeOfBirth":" Brussels, Belgium","birthName":"Patrick Nicolas Jean Sixte Ghislain Bauchau","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Patrick Nicolas Jean Sixte Ghislain Bauchau was born in Brussels, Belgium. His father, Henry Bauchau, is a noted author, psychoanalyst, and philosopher, while his mother was an educator who also helped operate a publishing company. Coming from an intellectual family, it's not surprising that Bauchau won an academic scholarship to Oxford University, where he received a degree in Modern Languages. In the early '60s, Bauchau became interested in film, and worked with French filmmaker Eric Rohmer; this led to Bauchau being cast in the leading role as Adrien in Rohmer's 1967 \"moral tale,\" La Collectionneuse. Bauchau and his fellow leading actors Haydee Politoff and Daniel Pommereulle were also credited with the film's dialogue. While this got Bauchau's acting career off to an impressive start, his naturalistic performance left many believing that Bauchau was simply playing himself. After \"Tuset Street\" (also released in 1967), Bauchau temporarily moved away from acting and worked with Salvador Dali constructing large pillow-like animal sculptures. In 1980, Bauchau re-launched his film career in Robert Kramer's \"Guns\", and in 1982, Wim Wenders cast him in the leading role of \"The State Of Things\". In 1984, Bauchau made his American film debut in Alan Rudolph's eccentric, romantic comedy \"Choose Me\", and through much of the rest of the decade he worked regularly on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1991, Bauchau scored an impressive role in Michael Tolkin's superb drama \"The Rapture\", and four years later the same director gave him a meaty role in \"The New Age\". Bauchau plays the villain the Bond flick, \"A View to a Kill\" and has starring roles in Entre Nous and The Music Teacher, both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film In 1996. Bauchau was cast in the television series \"Kindred: The Embraced\" as a patriarch of the living dead; while the series lasted only a few weeks, it did lead to the series regular role of Sydney in \"The Pretender\", which debuted the same year and ran for four seasons on NBC. Bauchau's higher profile in television helped him win notable roles in high-profile films such as \"Clear and Present Danger\", \"The Cell\", \"Ray\" and \"Panic Room\". Bauchau also plays notable roles in the independent features \"The Five Obstructions\", \"Twin Falls Idaho\", \"The Secretary\", \"Boy Culture\" and \"The Gray Man\" among several others. Bauchau is a series regular playing the blind seer Lodz on the HBO hit show \"Carnivale\" and recurs in NBC's \"Revelation\" and ABC's \"Alias\". He guest stars on numerous television shows including \"Castle\", \"CSI\", \"How to Make It In America\", \"Numbers\", \"Women's Murder Club\", \"House\", \"Dead Zone\" and \"24\" among many others. More recently in Europe Bauchau finished shooting the feature films \"Ladrones\" in Spain, \"Suzanne\" (France), \"Glenn\" (Belgium), \"Chrysalis\" (Italy) and Michel Houellebecq's \"Possibility Of an Island\" also filmed in Spain. Bauchau currently stars in the hit French TV series\" Mystere\". More recently in the USA Bauchau appears in Roland Emmerich's \"2012\", the Polish Brothers film \"The Sweet Smell Of Success\" and \"Extraordinary Measures\" with Harrison Ford. He recently returned from filming in Vera Cruz, Mexico on \"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\" with Mel Gibson. Bauchau speaks at least 6 languages fluently and has acted in films in different languages throughout the world. He holds passports in 3 countries including the USA. When not busy with acting, Bauchau lives in a small village outside Paris, and, in Malibu Lake, California, where he is an avid gardener, reader and art collector. He's married to Mijanou Bardot, Brigitte's sister, who also appears in La Collectionneuse. They have 5 dogs, and an adult daughter that lives in Rome.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MDM4MjczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAxNzQ4MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000872","name":"Patrick Bauchau","idIMDB":"nm0000872"},"actorId":"nm0000872","character":"Lucien Baines","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Vincent D'Onofrio","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000352","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTE2MDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUzMjcz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1959","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio was born on June 30, 1959 in Brooklyn, New York, to Phyllis, a restaurant manager and server, and Gene D'Onofrio, a theater production assistant and interior designer. He is of Italian descent and has two older sisters. He studied at the Actors Studio and the American Stanislavski Theatre. Vincent D'Onofrio is known as an \"actor's actor\". The wide variety of roles he has played and the quality of his work have earned him a reputation as a versatile talent. His first paid role was in Off-Broadway's \"This Property Is Condemned\". He continued appearing in plays and worked as a bouncer, a bodyguard and a delivery man. In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in \"Open Admissions\", followed by work in numerous other stage plays. In 2012, D'Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theater & Film Institute. As a film actor, D'Onofrio's career break came when he played a mentally unbalanced recruit in Full Metal Jacket (1987), directed by the renowned Stanley Kubrick. For this role D'Onofrio gained nearly 70 pounds. He had a major role in Dying Young (1991), and appeared prominently in the box-office smash Men in Black (1997) as the bad guy (Edgar \"The Bug\"). Other films of note in which he has appeared are Mystic Pizza (1988), JFK (1991), The Player (1992), Ed Wood (1994), The Cell (2000), The Break-Up (2006) and Jurassic World (2015). In 1996, D'Onofrio garnered critical acclaim along with co-star Renée Zellweger for The Whole Wide World (1996), which he helped produce. He also made a guest appearance in Homicide: Life on the Street: The Subway (1997), where he played an accident victim who could not be rescued and was destined to die. For this performance he won an Emmy nomination. In 2000, he both produced and starred in Steal This Movie (2000), a biopic of radical leader Abbie Hoffman. In 2001, D'Onofrio took the role which has likely given him his greatest public recognition: Det. Robert Goren, the lead character in the TV series Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001). Goren is based on Sherlock Holmes but, instead of relying upon physical evidence like Holmes, D'Onofrio's character focuses on psychology to identify the perpetrators, whom he often draws into confessing or yielding condemning evidence. He played the part for 10 years. In his career D'Onofrio's various film characters have included a priest, a bisexual former porn star, a hijacker, a serial killer, Orson Welles, a space alien, a 1960s radical leader, a pulp fiction writer, an ingenious police investigator and Stuart Smalley's dope-head brother. His on-screen love interests have included Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Renée Zellweger, Marisa Tomei, Tracey Ullman, Rebecca De Mornay and Lili Taylor. One of his latest roles is in Marvel's Daredevil (2015) as Daredevil's nemesis, Wilson Fisk. He lives in Manhattan with his wife and children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTE2MDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUzMjcz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000352","name":"Vincent D'Onofrio","nicknames":["The Human Chameleon","Noffy"],"idIMDB":"nm0000352"},"actorId":"nm0000352","character":"Carl Stargher","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010741","main":true},{"actorName":"Catherine Sutherland","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0840059","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NDQ3NzU2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA0ODgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 October 1974","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Catherine Jane Sutherland","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Catherine was born in Sydney, New South Wales Australia in 1974.

He has two older sisters, Victoria Vaughn and Valeri Vaughn. His recent ancestry includes Lebanese (from his paternal grandmother), Italian (from his maternal grandfather), English, Irish, German, and Scottish. His mother was born in Brantford, Ontario. Vince was interested in theater early on and grabbed a spot in a Chevy commercial. In 1988 he moved to Hollywood. He managed to hit a few spots on television, but his real goal was to make it to the big screen. He made his first credited role in the film Rudy (1993) where he met his friend Jon Favreau, who was writing a script detailing his life as an out-of-work actor. Vince was written into Swingers (1996) by Jon to play the character of \"Trent\". He signed on just as a favor to his buddy, not realizing it would be a career changing role. Though not a commercial success, it was a critical success in which Steven Spielberg saw him and cast him in the big budget sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). This role gave Vince the exposure he needed to become a movie star and, for the first time, choose the roles he wanted to take. A Cool, Dry Place (1998) put him as a loving father, Return to Paradise (1998) cast him as a man having to make a life or death decision to save a friend, and Clay Pigeons (1998) cast him as an interesting serial killer. Since then his roles have been primarily in comedies such as Old School (2003), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), Wedding Crashers (2005), and Couples Retreat (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDA0MzE0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUzOTI4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681","name":"Vince Vaughn","nicknames":["Mr Sunshine"],"idIMDB":"nm0000681"},"actorId":"nm0000681","character":"Peter Novak","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010740","main":true},{"actorName":"James Gammon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304000","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MzIxNDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA3NDYyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 April 1940","placeOfBirth":" Newman, Illinois, USA","birthName":"James Richard Gammon","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Rugged-looking James Gammon first broke into the entertainment industry not as an actor but as a TV cameraman.
