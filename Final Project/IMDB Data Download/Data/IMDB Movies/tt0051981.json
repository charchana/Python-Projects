It shows how to identify certain narcotics, identify the signs that someone is using, identify the signs of where drug deals take place, identify the signs of use in a secluded public place, and apprehend the users in these public settings. As it follows one young woman neglected by her parents, the film also shows the underlying causes of narcotics use, with these underlying causes often the forgotten issue as everyone tends to deal with the symptoms.","simplePlot":"Semi-documentary on how marijuana dealers lure small-town teenagers into heroin use and prostitution and how the police help to fight it.","actors":[{"actorName":"Art Gilmore","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0319497","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTI4MjI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc4OTU2MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 March 1912","placeOfBirth":" Tacoma, Washington, USA","birthName":"Arthur Wells Gilmore","bio":"Art Gilmore was born on March 18, 1912 in Tacoma, Washington, USA as Arthur Wells Gilmore.
