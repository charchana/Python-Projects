He hires another boy for a dollar a day to carry the son around on his back, to the school or to whatever whims may occur to the son. Actually the son is so skilled in jumping at really great speed, that he does not need any help or any \"horse\". The son's whims include not only verbal and physical abuse, but also repeated \"horse fights\" where \"the horse\" will continually be knocked down. Even \"the horse's\" tender feelings for a child girl beggar are exploited and mocked. Because of the brutal and degrading treatment \"the horse\" will become more and more similar to a real horse.","simplePlot":"A wealthy boy hires a poor child to carry him around like a horse.","actors":[{"actorName":"Ziya Mirza Mohamad","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3119499","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ziya Mirza Mohamad is an actor, known for Two-Legged Horse (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3119499","name":"Ziya Mirza Mohamad","idIMDB":"nm3119499"},"actorId":"nm3119499","character":"Guiah, the horse-child","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Haron Ahad","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3119224","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Haron Ahad is an actor, known for Two-Legged Horse (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3119224","name":"Haron Ahad","idIMDB":"nm3119224"},"actorId":"nm3119224","character":"The master","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gol-Ghotai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1924917","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Gol-Ghotai is an actress, known for Chiens égarés (2004), Two-Legged Horse (2008) and L'étoile du soldat (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1924917","name":"Gol-Ghotai","idIMDB":"nm1924917"},"actorId":"nm1924917","character":"The young beggar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Khojeh Nader","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3119588","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Khojeh Nader is an actor, known for Two-Legged Horse (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3119588","name":"Khojeh Nader","idIMDB":"nm3119588"},"actorId":"nm3119588","character":"The uncle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yasin Tavildar","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3462557","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Yasin Tavildar is an actor, known for Two-Legged Horse (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3462557","name":"Yasin Tavildar","idIMDB":"nm3462557"},"actorId":"nm3462557","character":"The father","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1039914","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039914","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 41 min (101 min) (Toronto International) (Canada)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Afghanistan"}],"rated":"TOUS PUBLICS","awards":[{"award":"Ghent International Film Festival 2008","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Georges Delerue Prize","categories":[{"category":"Best Music","names":[{"name":"Tolibhon Shakhidi","id":"nm0787664","role":null}]}]},{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Grand Prix","categories":[{"category":"Best Film","names":[]}]}]},{"award":"Nuremberg International Human Rights Film Festival 2009","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Nuremberg International Human Rights Film Award","categories":[{"category":"","names":[{"name":"Samira Makhmalbaf","id":"nm0538533","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"San Sebastián International Film Festival 2008","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Special Prize of the Jury","categories":[{"category":"","names":[{"name":"Samira Makhmalbaf","id":"nm0538533","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival 2008","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Special Mention","categories":[{"category":"","names":[{"name":"Samira Makhmalbaf","id":"nm0538533","role":null}]}]},{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Grand Prize","categories":[{"category":"","names":[{"name":"Samira Makhmalbaf","id":"nm0538533","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"401","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0057621","name":"Makhmalbaf Productions"},{"idCompany":"co0024845","name":"Wild Bunch"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["horse","child","beggar","school","bare chested boy","mutilated body","colt","desert","poverty","coin","teenager","little girl","little boy","bathing a child","afghanistan","mentally retarded person","cruelty","animal in title"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 04:23:30"}}
