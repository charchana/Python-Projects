She and her sister, actress Aimee Graham, were raised by their strictly Catholic parents. They relocated often, as a result of their father's occupation, and Heather became increasingly shy. Surprisingly, she had a passion for acting from an early age and despite being labeled a 'theater geek' by her peers, she was voted Most Talented by her high school senior class. Unfortunately, her love of acting created a tension between Heather and her family although her mother obligingly drove her to auditions in Hollywood throughout her adolescence. After high school Heather moved to Los Angeles and received small roles in a variety of films including Drugstore Cowboy (1989). When her career did not take off as quickly as was hoped, Heather enrolled in the University of California at Los Angeles to get her degree in drama. It was at UCLA that she was noticed by actor James Woods and received a subsequent part in a film Woods starred in, Diggstown (1992). Heather dropped out of UCLA after two years to pursue her acting career on a full time basis. Aside from gaining a modeling contract with Emanuel Ungaro Liberte, Heather has risen to star in such films as Swingers (1996), a role she received after being taken out swing dancing by Jon Favreau, to blockbusters like Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), and Boogie Nights (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMzk5MTM4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMxOTkwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001287","name":"Heather Graham","idIMDB":"nm0001287"},"actorId":"nm0001287","character":"Felicity Shagwell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002422","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael York","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001868","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzgzNTg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTk3ODM1._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 March 1942","placeOfBirth":" Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, England, UK","birthName":"Michael York-Johnson","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Michael York was born in Fulmer, England, 27 March 1942.

His paternal grandparents were German and his maternal grandparents were Norwegian. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was seven. Always wanting to be an actor, he held a variety of jobs while pursuing his goal, but it was while dining with his parents at a restaurant in Beverly Hills that he was \"discovered\" by a talent scout. After making his uncredited screen debut in The Happy Years (1950), Wagner was signed by 20th Century Fox, which carefully built him up toward stardom. He played romantic leads with ease, but it wasn't until he essayed the two-scene role of a shellshocked war veteran in With a Song in My Heart (1952) that studio executives recognized his potential as a dramatic actor. He went on to play the title roles in Prince Valiant (1954) and The True Story of Jesse James (1957), and portrayed a cold-blooded murderer in A Kiss Before Dying (1956). In the mid-'60s, however, his film career skidded to a stop after The Pink Panther (1963). Several years of unemployment followed before Wagner made a respectable transition to television as star of the lighthearted espionage series It Takes a Thief (1968) (1968-1970). He also starred in the police series Switch (1975), but Wagner's greatest success was opposite Stefanie Powers in the internationally popular Hart to Hart (1979), which ran from 1979 through 1984 and has since been sporadically revived in TV-movie form (a 1986 series, Lime Street (1985), was quickly canceled due to the tragic death of Wagner's young co-star, Samantha Smith). Considered one of Hollywood's nicest citizens, Robert Wagner has continued to successfully pursue a leading man career; he has also launched a latter-day stage career, touring with Stefanie Powers in the readers' theater presentation \"Love Letters\". He found success playing Number Two, a henchman to Dr. Evil in the blockbuster trilogy Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997), Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999), and Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), and in 2007 he began playing Teddy, a recurring role on the hit CBS series Two and a Half Men (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MjU3NTk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzODI0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001822","name":"Robert Wagner","nicknames":["RJ","The Brylcreem Kid"],"idIMDB":"nm0001822"},"actorId":"nm0001822","character":"Number Two","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002428","main":true},{"actorName":"Rob Lowe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY2NjYxMDY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3MTMwNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 March 1964","placeOfBirth":" Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","birthName":"Robert Hepler Lowe","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Rob Lowe was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, to Barbara Lynn (Hepler), a schoolteacher, and Charles Davis Lowe, a lawyer.
