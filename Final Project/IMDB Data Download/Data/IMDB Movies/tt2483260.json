She was later transferred to Whitefish Bay High School, where she graduated. Whitman made her first silver screen debut playing Meg Ryan's youngest daughter, \"Casey Green\", in When a Man Loves a Woman (1994). Among her notable childhood roles were that of \"Patricia Whitmore\", daughter of the President in Independence Day (1996); George Clooney's daughter, \"Maggie Taylor\", in One Fine Day (1996); and the charming daughter, \"Bernice Pruitt\", of Sandra Bullock, in Hope Floats (1998).

Lucy's mother, Cecilia, a biochemist, is from Beijing, and her father, Tom Liu, a civil engineer, is from Shanghai. Once relegated to \"ethnic\" parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady. Liu graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 and enrolled in New York University; discouraged by the \"dark and sarcastic\" atmosphere of NYU, however, she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated from UM with a degree in Chinese Language and Culture, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts, and acting. During her senior year, Liu auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead; encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like NYPD Blue (1993), ER (1994), and The X-Files (1993). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman's ephemeral sitcom Pearl (1996). Liu first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in Jerry Maguire (1996) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie Bang (1995), but it was shelved for two years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on Ally McBeal (1997). Liu initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to Portia de Rossi, but writer-producer David E. Kelley was so impressed with her that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which Liu filled with such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member. The \"Ally\" win gave Liu's film career a much-needed boost--in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the Mel Gibson action flick Payback (1999), and as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga Play It to the Bone (1999). The next year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Jackie Chan's western Shanghai Noon (2000), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in Charlie's Angels (2000). When she's not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, Liu keeps busy with an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses, and plays the accordion. In 1993 she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study and create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn't leave much time for romantic intrigue, but Liu says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgxODE0MjI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxMzMzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005154","name":"Lucy Liu","idIMDB":"nm0005154"},"actorId":"nm0005154","character":"Silvermist","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0117892","main":true},{"actorName":"Raven-Symoné","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712368","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MzM4NTA0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyOTgyNQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 December 1985","placeOfBirth":" Atlanta, Georgia, USA","birthName":"Raven-Symoné Christina Pearman","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Raven-Symoné Pearman was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Lydia (Gaulden) and Christopher Pearman. At a young age, she moved to New York. While there Raven signed with the Ford Modeling Agency. They sent her out on a audition for a movie called Ghost Dad (1990), which also starred the legendary Bill Cosby. She was deemed too young for the role since was only 3 years old, but Cosby could see she had talent. They asked Raven to come back to read lines, and she did so well that she got a starring role as Olivia on the last three seasons of The Cosby Show (1984). After the show finished its run, she decided to try something new like singing. In 1993, she became the youngest person ever to sign with MCA Records. She also went back to acting with a starring role in Hangin' with Mr. Cooper (1992), alongside Mark Curry and a small role in the TV mini-series Queen (1993). After another small role in the feature film The Little Rascals (1994) and the role of Goldilocks in the TV series Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child (1995), \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\" ended. Raven's singing career was doing well and she landed a role in Doctor Dolittle (1998) alongside Eddie Murphy and a made-for-TV movie called Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century (1999). She also starred in Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), but she was not available to do Zenon: The Zequel (2001). However, the Walt Disney Company, which made the Zenon movies, wanted her back to do a pilot for a new Disney TV show called \"Absolutely Psychic,\" in which she would be a supporting character. She impressed them so much that they changed the show's premise to be about her and the show's name was changed to That's So Raven (2003). After the show was a hit she did the made-for-TV movie Les Cheetah Girls (2003) and recorded a new album. A movie based on \"That's So Raven\" may be in the works.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MzM4NTA0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyOTgyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712368","name":"Raven-Symoné","nicknames":["Rae","Rave"],"idIMDB":"nm0712368"},"actorId":"nm0712368","character":"Iridessa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0137045","main":true},{"actorName":"Megan Hilty","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2047859","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5OTgyOTkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5NjQ2ODE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 March 1981","placeOfBirth":" Bellevue, Washington, USA","birthName":"Megan Kathleen Hilty","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Megan Hilty was born on March 29, 1981 in Bellevue, Washington, USA as Megan Kathleen Hilty.

DeLisle started in a few animation series and, since then, has been featured in numerous video games. She is best-known for her sinister voice of the evil sister \"Vicky\" in the Nickelodeon TV series, \"Fairly OddParents\" (2001-2013), as well as the equally evil \"Mandy\" in the Cartoon Network TV show, \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\" (2001 - 2007). She voiced evil, cold \"Mandy\" again in two more films about Billy and Mandy, \"Billy and Mandy Big Boogie Adventure\" (2007) and \"The Grim Adventures of KND\" (2007), opposite'Richard Steven Horvitz' (Billy) and Greg Eagles (Grim). In 2002, Grey DeLisle married musician Murry Hammond, the bassist for the band, Old 97's. Their first child, Jefferson Texas Hammond, was born in 2007, in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg2MTQxOTUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTgxNTExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0217221","name":"Grey DeLisle","idIMDB":"nm0217221"},"actorId":"nm0217221","character":"MC Fairy / Gliss","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0434705","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2483260","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2483260","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":[{"money":"HUF 28,020,442","country":"Hungary","day":"10","month":"08","year":"2014","remarks":""}],"gross":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/2014/\">2014</a>"}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 18 min (78 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["Digital (Digital Cinema Package DCP)"]},"rating":"6.6","metascore":"51","filmingLocations":[],"rated":"G","awards":[{"award":"Behind the Voice Actors Awards 2015","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated BTVA Special/DVD Voice Acting Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Female Vocal Performance in a TV Special/Direct-to-DVD Title or Theatrical Short","names":[{"name":"Christina Hendricks","id":"nm0376716","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Male Vocal Performance in a TV Special/Direct-to-DVD Title or Theatrical Short","names":[{"name":"Jeff Bennett","id":"nm0071818","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Male Vocal Performance in a TV Special/Direct-to-DVD Title or Theatrical Short","names":[{"name":"Jim Cummings","id":"nm0191906","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Vocal Ensemble in a TV Special/Direct-to-DVD Title or Theatrical Short","names":[{"name":"Mae Whitman","id":"nm0926165","role":null},{"name":"Christina Hendricks","id":"nm0376716","role":null},{"name":"Tom Hiddleston","id":"nm1089991","role":null},{"name":"Lucy Liu","id":"nm0005154","role":null},{"name":"Raven-Symoné","id":"nm0712368","role":null},{"name":"Megan Hilty","id":"nm2047859","role":null},{"name":"Pamela Adlon","id":"nm0781899","role":null},{"name":"Angela Bartys","id":"nm3444280","role":null},{"name":"Jeff Bennett","id":"nm0071818","role":null},{"name":"Jim Cummings","id":"nm0191906","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Motion Picture Sound Editors, USA 2015","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Golden Reel Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Sound Editing - Direct to Video - Animation","names":[{"name":"Todd Toon","id":"nm0002477","role":"supervising sound editor, sound designer"},{"name":"Thomas Whiting","id":"nm0926034","role":"supervising dialogue editor, supervising adr editor"},{"name":"John Roesch","id":"nm0736430","role":"foley artist"},{"name":"Alyson Dee Moore","id":"nm0600888","role":"foley artist"},{"name":"Odin Benitez","id":"nm0071229","role":"sound effects editor"},{"name":"Adam Kopald","id":"nm0465676","role":"sound effects editor"},{"name":"Charles W.
