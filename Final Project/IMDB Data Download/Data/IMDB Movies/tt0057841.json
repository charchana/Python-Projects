His long lasting career with the National Theatre of Bucharest enabled Mimi Petrut to play various roles in the company of famed actors, and great stage directors. And it was in only one instance when Mimi Petrut was in the same movie with his nephew, actor-director Tudor Petrut, \"Femeia din Ursa Mare\", shot in 1981. From that family experience remains only one black and white picture... Emanoil Petrut passed away in 1983, a short time after his beloved wife, broadcaster Catinca Ralea Petrut.

She was also the maternal grand-aunt of the Romanian director and writer Mihnea Columbeanu, and an aunt of the Romanian actress Ana-Maria Nicolau. She was married to Constantin Toneanu, and they had a daughter, Rodica (1920-1968). She acted in several Romanian theaters, reaching the highest peak of her career in Brasov, where one of her most successful parts was Adela, the rich businesswoman in Horia Lovinescu's drama \"Citadela sfärâmatä\" (\"The Crushed Citadel\"). In cinema, she was specialized in powerful cameos, being able to build up convincing and meaty characters by using barely a few expressive lines and actions. All her roles were contributing with humor and veracity to the general picture, and she was much liked and respected by the directors and other cast and crew, being also a very funny and charismatic person - the perpetual \"granny type\", always ready with a snappy joke or wise word. She died in Bucharest, aged 84, almost ten years after her last role.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1617680","name":"Nunuta Hodos","idIMDB":"nm1617680"},"actorId":"nm1617680","character":"Irinuca","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Eduard Bulgaru","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5966055","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Eduard Bulgaru is an actor, known for Memories of My Childhood (1965).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5966055","name":"Eduard Bulgaru","idIMDB":"nm5966055"},"actorId":"nm5966055","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0057841","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057841","business":{"budget":{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"09","month":"09","year":"1964","remarks":null},"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"22","month":"12","year":"1964","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"19","month":"02","year":"1965","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 12 min (72 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.37 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Laboratoarele Buftea, Bucharest, Romania"],"filmLength":["2,036 m (Romania)"],"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"8.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Romania"}],"awards":[{"award":"Gijón International Film Festival 1965","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Grand Prix Osso Pardo Asturiano","categories":[{"category":"","names":[{"name":"Elisabeta Bostan","id":"nm0098208","role":"director"},{"name":"Studioul Cinematografic Bucuresti","id":null,"role":"production company"}]}]},{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Special Jury Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Film","names":[{"name":"Elisabeta Bostan","id":"nm0098208","role":"director"},{"name":"Studioul Cinematografic Bucuresti","id":null,"role":"production company"}]}]}]}],"votes":"351","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0001642","name":"Studioul Cinematografic Bucuresti"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["childhood","teacher","priest","19th century","f rated","trampled","contagious","scab","itch","boulder","merchant","classroom","lazy","wagon","church","cousin","father son relationship","mother son relationship","peasant","agriculture","market","lying","stealing","cherry tree","punishment","school","friend","based on biography","countryside","romania","nudity","clothes blown off","remembrance","duck","hen house","naked bathing","farm","river","based on book"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 07:36:37"}}
