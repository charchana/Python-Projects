Agnt Collington on the critically acclaimed HBO series Treme and for playing Special advisor to President Nixon, John Ehrlichman in the award winning Lee Daniels' The Butler. His career spans television, film, theatre, and commercials - he has been cast as everything from a cocky businessman to a vengeful cowboy to a tortured priest to a renegade cop (OK, he's been a cop more times than he can count!). He's shared the screen with and worked alongside his share of Oscar, Emmy & Tony winners including Melissa Leo, David Morse, John Cusack, Forest Whitaker, & David Simon. Colin is native of New Orleans, where his family has been since the 1700's. Most of his family still lives there, so he considers himself lucky to be able to \"go home\" so often for work. Before moving to Los Angeles, Colin studied and worked as an actor in New Orleans (long before it became \"Hollywood South\"), Boulder, Boston and Santa Fe. He received a bachelor's degree in acting and directing from The College of Santa Fe, but is far from finished with his studies. He has trained with many amazing teachers including Stephen Book, Karen Grassle, Jack Hannibal, Lily Parker and many others. Proud of his theater roots, he also started a theater company in the basement of a Santa Fe, NM coffee shop with acclaimed playwright Steven Adly Guirgis (who at the time was just another hungry young actor.) Colin is married to Cathy Kim Walker and they have two young children. He built the home where they live which is a little piece of \"Nola\" (New Orleans La.) in LALALand. Colin is an avid marathoner and Ironman triathlete - and an enthusiastic surfer. He loves to cook creole dinners, and is known for his annual crawfish boil.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NDYwMjk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwNDYyMTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1240176","name":"Colin Walker","idIMDB":"nm1240176"},"actorId":"nm1240176","character":"Stanley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Madison Wolfe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4068901","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMzQ5OTI0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQzMzQxOTE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"October2002","placeOfBirth":" Metairie, Louisiana, USA","height":"5' 2½\" (1.59 m)","bio":"Madison Wolfe made her debut with the Will Ferrell-Zach Galifianakis comedy The Campaign and in the last two years has racked up a considerable amount of credits.
