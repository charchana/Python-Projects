Erin's parents claim she experienced paranormal encounters as early as the age of three, and spoke with her deceased grandfather on a consistent basis. While Erin recalls informing her parents of these occurrences, she does not specifically remember the incidents. Born near the historic Hill in St. Louis Missouri, Erin Marie Hogan began singing, acting and dancing at a young age. She was enrolled in the Ballet Conservatory of Saint Louis where she studied, before moving to COCA to continue her training. Throughout childhood, Erin participated in school plays and did some modeling on the side, but maintained a relatively normal childhood in spite of her mother's position as a prominent attorney - which accidentally threw her into the local spotlight. In high school, Erin began singing competitively and performing in more community and underground theatre - somehow balancing school work, cheerleading, choir, and acting. Erin struggled with dyslexia, but overcame that hurtle and graduated with honors. While in her teens and early twenties, Erin portrayed Maria in The Sound of Music, Rose in Meet Me In St. Louis, Vina in the original drama Brushup Ten, and Patty Simcox in what was probably the raunchiest version of Grease! St. Louis has ever seen. While pursuing her degree in film at Webster University, Erin worked at Six Flags St. Louis playing Miss Kitty for seven months in their live music comedy. She also took up aerial tissues as a hobby. After moving to Los Angeles to pursue acting further, Erin's career took off. She immediately landed her first leading role in the cult favorite Paranormal Entity (2009), and went on to star in Hold Your Breath (2012), and numerous award winning short films. She won Best Actress In A Drama at the Playhouse West Film Festival for her portrayal of an agoraphobic young woman, haunted by the memory of her fiancé's murder. After the first screening, and man approached Erin to compliment her on her performance, and explained that he was a recovering agoraphobic. Erin maintains this is the greatest compliment she has ever received. Erin considers herself extremely lucky to have starred along side actors such as Mischa Barton, Danny Trejo, Aaron Paul, and Vinnie Jones. Erin and her friends also produced an Arrested Development (2003) fan series entitled Paul Goetz's Last Ditch Effort (2012) about Erin's real-life friend Paul, and his attempt to get cast on the new season of his favorite television series, Arrested Development. Erin volunteers with animal rescue groups in the Los Angeles area.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NzExMjczMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAwNzI4MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1296783","name":"Erin Marie Hogan","idIMDB":"nm1296783"},"actorId":"nm1296783","character":"Samantha Finley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fia Perera","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0673318","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDc4NDg3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczOTgyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR18,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Fia Perera is an actress and writer, known for Inappropriate Fairy Tales (2008), What the Feng?
