His mother was of German descent and his father had English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He was raised in Brisbane, Queensland, after his parents split up. Rush attended Everton Park State High School during his formative years. His early interest in the theatre led to his 1971 stage debut at age 20 in \"Wrong Side of the Moon\" with the Queensland Theatre Company. Known for his classical repertory work over the years, he scored an unexpected hit with his Queensland role as Snoopy in the musical \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\". A few years later he moved to France to study but subsequently returned to his homeland within a short time and continued work as both actor and director with the Queensland company (\"June and the Paycock,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Godspell,\" \"Present Laughter,\" \"The Rivals\"). In the 1980s Rush became a vital member of the State Theatre Company of South Australia and showed an equally strong range there in such productions as \"Revenger's Tragedy,\" \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" \"Mother Courage...and Her Children,\" \"Blood Wedding,\" \"Pal Joey,\" \"Twelfth Night\" and as The Fool in \"King Lear\". Rush made an inauspicious debut in films with the feature Hoodwink (1981), having little more than a bit part, and didn't carry off his first major role until playing Sir Andrew Aguecheek in a movie production of Twelfth Night (1987). Yet, he remained a durable presence on stage with acclaimed productions in \"The Diary of a Madman\" in 1989 and \"The Government Inspector\" in 1991. Rush suffered a temporary nervous breakdown in 1992 due to overwork and anguish over his lack of career advancement. Resting for a time, he eventually returned to the stage. Within a few years film-goers finally began taking notice of Geoffrey after his performance in Children of the Revolution (1996). This led to THE role of a lifetime as the highly dysfunctional piano prodigy David Helfgott in Shine (1996). Rush's astonishing tour-de-force performance won him every conceivable award imaginable, including the Oscar, Golden Globe, British Film Award and Australian Film Institute Award. \"Shine\" not only put Rush on the international film map, but atypically on the Hollywood \"A\" list as well. His rather homely mug was made fascinating by a completely charming, confident and captivating demeanor; better yet, it allowed him to more easily dissolve into a number of transfixing historical portrayals, notably his Walsingham in Elizabeth (1998), Marquis de Sade in Quills (2000), and Leon Trotsky in Frida (2002). He's also allowed himself to have a bit of hammy fun in such box office escapism as Mystery Men (1999), House on Haunted Hill (1999), The Banger Sisters (2002), Finding Nemo (2003) and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). More than validating his early film success, two more Oscar nominations came his way in the same year for Quills (2000) (best actor) and Shakespeare in Love (1998) (support actor) in 2000. Geoffrey's amazing versatility continues to impress, more recently as the manic, volatile comedy genius Peter Sellers in the biopic The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004). Rush's intermittent returns to the stage have included productions of \"Marat-Sade,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" \"Oleanna,\" \"Hamlet\" and \"The Small Poppies\". In 2009 he made his Broadway debut in \"Exit the King\" co-starring Susan Sarandon. His marriage (since 1988) to Aussie classical actress Jane Menelaus produced daughter Angelica (1992) and son James (1995). Menelaus, who has also performed with the State Theatre of South Australia, has co-starred on stage with Rush in \"The Winter's Tale\" (1987), \"Troilus and Cressida\" (1989) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (as Gwendolyn to his Jack Worthing). She also had a featured role in his film Quills (2000).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MjkxNDU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk3MDQ0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001691","name":"Geoffrey Rush","idIMDB":"nm0001691"},"actorId":"nm0001691","character":"The Marquis de Sade","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0026767","main":true},{"actorName":"Kate Winslet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000701","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODgzMzM2NTE0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyMTkyOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 October 1975","placeOfBirth":" Reading, Berkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Kate Elizabeth Winslet","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Ask Kate Winslet what she likes about any of her characters, and the word \"ballsy\" is bound to pop up at least once. The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she's built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica. Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London's West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Créatures célestes (1994). The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics. Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film's star, Emma Thompson, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Jude (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996). The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations. After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997), Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare in Love (1998) and Anna and the King (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in Hideous Kinky (1998) and Holy Smoke (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \"deprogramming\" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in Quills (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama The Reader (2008), playing a former concentration camp guard. For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015), she received her seventh Academy Award nomination. Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss. In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated, and divorced in October 2010. In 2012, Kate married Ned Rocknroll, with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODgzMzM2NTE0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyMTkyOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000701","name":"Kate Winslet","nicknames":["English Rose","Corset Kate"],"idIMDB":"nm0000701"},"actorId":"nm0000701","character":"Madeleine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0409854","main":true},{"actorName":"Joaquin Phoenix","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAzNjg5MDE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIxNzU0OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 October 1974","placeOfBirth":" San Juan, Puerto Rico","birthName":"Joaquin Rafael Bottom","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Joaquin Rafael Phoenix was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Arlyn (Dunetz) and John Bottom, and is the middle child in a brood of five. His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family in New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe. The family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin's first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River's sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982). He worked with his brother again on the afterschool special ABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp SpaceCamp (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Russkies (1987). In the late '80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River's film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn't sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in Parenthood (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world. His parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in My Own Private Idaho (1991) and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman's obsessive devotee in To Die For (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics' darling in his own right. His follow-up turn in Inventing the Abbotts (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to future fiancée Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone's U Turn - Ici commence l'enfer (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Return to Paradise (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Clay Pigeons (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8 mm (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Gladiator (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe's swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role. Later that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in The Yards (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade's asylum in Quills (2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musician Johnny Cash in the biography Walk the Line (2005). He also recorded an album, the film's soundtrack, for which he received the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAzNjg5MDE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIxNzU0OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618","name":"Joaquin Phoenix","nicknames":["Kitten","Joaq","Leaf"],"idIMDB":"nm0001618"},"actorId":"nm0001618","character":"Coulmier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0366622","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Caine","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 March 1933","placeOfBirth":" Rotherhithe, London, England, UK","birthName":"Maurice Joseph Micklewhite","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen Frances Marie (Burchell), a charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish-market porter. He left school at 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the years that followed he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit, \"The Long and the Short and the Tall.\" Zulu (1964), the 1964 epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-'60s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), Play Dirty (1969), Battle of Britain (1969), Too Late the Hero (1970), The Last Valley (1971) and especially Get Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command. There were some gems amongst the dross, however. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Educating Rita (1983) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999) (his second Oscar) and Last Orders (2001) have been widely acclaimed.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","name":"Michael Caine","idIMDB":"nm0000323"},"actorId":"nm0000323","character":"Royer-Collard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Billie Whitelaw","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925794","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU0NDY5NTM3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU4NDYwOA@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 June 1932","placeOfBirth":" Coventry, Warwickshire, England, UK","birthName":"Billie Honor Whitelaw","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Billie Whitelaw first appeared on the radio aged 11.

After a few years working in Theatre, Commercials and supporting roles on TV he joined the cast of fledgling comedy \"Birds of a Feather\" as Dave, the lover of Sharon (Pauline Quirke). He was originally in 2 episodes but made such an impact with the fans that he was bought back for the third series. When he met Peter Richardson in Sarah Stockbridge's garden Peter asked him if he was available to do a day's work on \"The Glam Metal Detectives\" for the Comic Strip\", 1 day became 3 months and he played literally hundreds of characters. A year of commercials introduced him to director Peter Chelsom, Peter cast him right away as Gordon in \"Hear my Song\" opposite Ned Beatty. Then there were a couple of years getting great roles on British TV, in the likes of \"The Hot Dog Wars\", \"Dangerfield\" and \"Kavanagh QC\" and \"Our Friends in the North\" opposite Malcolm McDowell and Daniel Craig. His movie career was moving alongside this at quite a pace with roles opposite Timothy Dalton in \"The Beautician and the Beast\", Robert Englund in \"The Killer Tongue\" and Richard Harris in \"Savage Hearts\". In 1996 his agent set up a meeting on a small low budget movie with an unknown director named Guy Ritchie; Guy offered him the role of Nick the Greek in his movie \"Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels\". 3 years later the film it was released and became the biggest British movie in the last 20 years and launched the careers of Nick Moran, Vinnie Jones, Guy Ritchie, Jason Statham, and Mathew Vaughn. \"Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels\" led on to more movies and Hollywood started knocking on the door. Alan Parker had him do a small role in \"Angela's Ashes\", Philip Kaufman asked him to play Bouchon in \"Quills\" alongside Kate Winslett, Michael Caine, Joaquin Phoenix and Geoffrey Rush. Richard Eyre called on him twice, for \"Iris\" opposite Judy Dench and in \"Complete Female Stage Beauty\" with Clare Danes. This was followed by the role of Ted Ray in \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\" directed by Bill Paxton, Bill had seen his work and after speaking to his agent he called Stephen from his car phone (very Hollywood) and offered him the part. Then the role of Big Mike in Kinky Boots came along. Alongside a very successful movie career he did several TV series for the USA, Canada and the UK. \"Starhunter 2300\" in which he played Rudolpho De Luna, he played the co-lead in the BBC series \"Cavegirl\". he played Banjo and Broadman in the adaptations of Terry Prachett's \"Hogfather\" and \"The Colour of Magic\" for Sky TV, plus the two 20th anniversary episodes of \"Casualty\" and regular roles in \"Kingdom\" (with Stephen Fry) and \"Larkrise to Candleford\". More recently he has done two films with the Warchowski Brothers - \"Speed Racer\" and \"Ninja Assassin\". He is married to the most beautiful woman in the world, Sarah and they have 2 small dogs, Fry and Ronnie. He has 2 main hobbies, he loves to play golf (at which he is terrible) and he loves to coach American Football (which he does for the London Olympians). He also runs a guided walking tour taking in gangster film and real life locations.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1M2IzOTMtNzE5Yi00MDhlLTg2NTYtYzZjMjcwYWFiNjdhL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA2NTU0ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007154","name":"Stephen Marcus","idIMDB":"nm0007154"},"actorId":"nm0007154","character":"Bouchon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elizabeth Berrington","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0077397","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NTU4MzI0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkzNzc0NA@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 August 1970","placeOfBirth":" Wallasey, Cheshire, England, UK","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Elizabeth Berrington was born on August 3, 1970 in Wallasey, Cheshire, England.
