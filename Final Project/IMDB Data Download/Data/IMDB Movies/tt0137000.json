In 1969, Matheson joined the cast of NBC's western series, The Virginian (1962), in its eighth season, as \"Jim Horn\". During the final season of the television western Bonanza (1959) in 1972-1973, Matheson played \"Griff King\", a parolee who tries to reform his life as a worker at the Ponderosa Ranch under Ben Cartwright's watch. Following that, he portrayed young motorcycle cop \"Phil Sweet\", in the 1973 film, Magnum Force (1973). In the fall of 1976, Matheson was seen opposite Kurt Russell in the NBC series, The Quest (1976), the story of two young men in the American West seeking the whereabouts of their sister, a captive of the Cheyenne.
