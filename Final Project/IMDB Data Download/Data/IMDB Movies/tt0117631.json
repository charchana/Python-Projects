His mother was of German descent and his father had English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. He was raised in Brisbane, Queensland, after his parents split up. Rush attended Everton Park State High School during his formative years. His early interest in the theatre led to his 1971 stage debut at age 20 in \"Wrong Side of the Moon\" with the Queensland Theatre Company. Known for his classical repertory work over the years, he scored an unexpected hit with his Queensland role as Snoopy in the musical \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\". A few years later he moved to France to study but subsequently returned to his homeland within a short time and continued work as both actor and director with the Queensland company (\"June and the Paycock,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Godspell,\" \"Present Laughter,\" \"The Rivals\"). In the 1980s Rush became a vital member of the State Theatre Company of South Australia and showed an equally strong range there in such productions as \"Revenger's Tragedy,\" \"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\" \"Mother Courage...and Her Children,\" \"Blood Wedding,\" \"Pal Joey,\" \"Twelfth Night\" and as The Fool in \"King Lear\". Rush made an inauspicious debut in films with the feature Hoodwink (1981), having little more than a bit part, and didn't carry off his first major role until playing Sir Andrew Aguecheek in a movie production of Twelfth Night (1987). Yet, he remained a durable presence on stage with acclaimed productions in \"The Diary of a Madman\" in 1989 and \"The Government Inspector\" in 1991. Rush suffered a temporary nervous breakdown in 1992 due to overwork and anguish over his lack of career advancement. Resting for a time, he eventually returned to the stage. Within a few years film-goers finally began taking notice of Geoffrey after his performance in Children of the Revolution (1996). This led to THE role of a lifetime as the highly dysfunctional piano prodigy David Helfgott in Shine (1996). Rush's astonishing tour-de-force performance won him every conceivable award imaginable, including the Oscar, Golden Globe, British Film Award and Australian Film Institute Award. \"Shine\" not only put Rush on the international film map, but atypically on the Hollywood \"A\" list as well. His rather homely mug was made fascinating by a completely charming, confident and captivating demeanor; better yet, it allowed him to more easily dissolve into a number of transfixing historical portrayals, notably his Walsingham in Elizabeth (1998), Marquis de Sade in Quills (2000), and Leon Trotsky in Frida (2002). He's also allowed himself to have a bit of hammy fun in such box office escapism as Mystery Men (1999), House on Haunted Hill (1999), The Banger Sisters (2002), Finding Nemo (2003) and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). More than validating his early film success, two more Oscar nominations came his way in the same year for Quills (2000) (best actor) and Shakespeare in Love (1998) (support actor) in 2000. Geoffrey's amazing versatility continues to impress, more recently as the manic, volatile comedy genius Peter Sellers in the biopic The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004). Rush's intermittent returns to the stage have included productions of \"Marat-Sade,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" \"Oleanna,\" \"Hamlet\" and \"The Small Poppies\". In 2009 he made his Broadway debut in \"Exit the King\" co-starring Susan Sarandon. His marriage (since 1988) to Aussie classical actress Jane Menelaus produced daughter Angelica (1992) and son James (1995). Menelaus, who has also performed with the State Theatre of South Australia, has co-starred on stage with Rush in \"The Winter's Tale\" (1987), \"Troilus and Cressida\" (1989) and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" (as Gwendolyn to his Jack Worthing). She also had a featured role in his film Quills (2000).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MjkxNDU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk3MDQ0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001691","name":"Geoffrey Rush","idIMDB":"nm0001691"},"actorId":"nm0001691","character":"David Helfgott - Adult","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013030","main":true},{"actorName":"Justin Braine","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104051","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Justin Braine is an actor, known for Shine (1996), The Life of Harry Dare (1995) and Blue Heelers (1994).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104051","name":"Justin Braine","idIMDB":"nm0104051"},"actorId":"nm0104051","character":"Tony","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sonia Todd","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865286","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1OTgzMTgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIwOTA4Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1959","placeOfBirth":" Adelaide, South Australia, Australia","bio":"Sonia Todd was born in 1959 in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

His family lived in both England and New Zealand before returning to his parents' native Australia in 1974. His parents divorced when he was a teenager and his father remarried--to theater publicist, Suzie Howie. Noah left home at age 16 before graduating from University High School in Melbourne when he fell into acting. He decided to pursue his craft at St. Martin's Youth Theater. Despite his intense studies, the remote, slim-framed actor did not make his professional theater debut until March 1997 with Chekhov's \"The Seagull.\" His work at St. Martin's led to an auspicious debut playing the painfully shy and sensitive teen Danny Embling in the coming-of-age film The Year My Voice Broke (1987). This affecting performance lost none of its heart-tugging appeal when the sequel Flirting (1991) came out four years later. Noah won awards for both films. Unconventionally typecast as the gawky, gloomy-eyed, somewhat manic depressive, directors started lining up to use the young actor. It all culminated in what is arguably the best known performance of his career--as the young, tortured genius, pianist David Helfgott, in Shine (1996). Working in tandem with Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush, who played Helfgott as an older adult, Noah's scenes with Armin Mueller-Stahl, who played the pianist's egregiously abusive father, were incredibly powerful and helped him to win the Film Critics Circle of Australia and Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival awards. The variety of Noah's performances have been stunning over the years. He played a young Adolf Hitler in the drama Max (2002), a \"what-if\" spin on Hitler growing up as an angry tortured artist instead of a Fascist dictator following World War I. He played the darkly humorous protagonist in He Died with a Felafel in His Hand (2001) and the titular Jewish outcast in Simon Magus (1999). Music, songwriting and art have been other strong passions for Noah. In 1994 he became part of a band called \"The Honky Tonk Angels. A singer-guitarist, included in this band were Noah's co-stars from previous movies Loene Carmen and Kym Wilson. He has also formed other bands with such names as Cardboard Box Man, Flipper & Humphrey and The Thirteens, a country-western rock group. American audiences have taken an equal \"shine\" to Noah recently, particularly as the manager of Stillwater in the popular film Almost Famous (2000); as Bryce in the popular adventure film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and its sequel which both starring Angelina Jolie; a featured role in Vanilla Sky (2001) which starred Tom Cruise; and in the \"Willy Wonka\" extravaganza Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) as Mr. Bucket.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MDUxMDUzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc3MzE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852965","name":"Noah Taylor","idIMDB":"nm0852965"},"actorId":"nm0852965","character":"David Helfgott - Adolescent","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013030","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Linkson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512959","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Paul Linkson is known for his work on Shine (1996) and Gallipoli (1981).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512959","name":"Paul Linkson","idIMDB":"nm0512959"},"actorId":"nm0512959","character":"State Champion Announcer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Randall Berger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0074327","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 May 1953","placeOfBirth":" Fort Irwin, California, USA","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Randall Berger grew up in Santa Barbara, California, doing a lot of work with local theatre companies, namely Youth Theatre Productions (1967-72) and Alechama Productions (1972). In 1973, wunderlust got the better of him and he emigrated to Australia at age 19 (Best buddy actor Lance Strauss had emigrated with his family in 1971). Following the course set in his early teens, Randall went into professional theatre, namely music theatre in original Australian casts of Broadway and West End shows. He married in 1977 and settled in Melbourne, beginning a parallel career as a professisonal writer in radio, multimedia and advertising, as well as taking extras work and small roles in local TV productions. In 1983, the first film role of note was as a reporter in the film Phar Lap (1983). As a \"portly\" character actor and an American, roles were few and far between. While only doing a couple of roles a year, Randall still had the opportunity to share some celluloid with a lot of incredible people, notably James Coburn, Reb Brown, Anthony Hopkins, Ron Leibman, Heather Thomas, Joe Bottoms (an old Santa Barbara chum), Barry Bostwick, John Savage, Steven Berkoff, Art Malik, Noah Taylor, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Laura Brannigan, Peter Graves, Paul Hogan, Cuba Gooding Jr. and so on, not to mention the amazing range of directors and DOPs.
