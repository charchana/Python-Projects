A shy child, she one day came home and, to the astonishment of her family, told them she had gotten the lead in the play \"The Wizard of Oz\". With the blessing of her parents, her grandmother helped her to find an agent and shortly afterward, she made her television debut in a Christmas Special starring Red Skelton and Vincent Price. Throughout her childhood, Nicole was active in commercials and theatre. At age seventeen, she was cast as a series regular in the CBC drama 9B (1988). Nicole's numerous television credits include: Beyond Reality (1991), First Resort (1990), Catwalk (1992), The Kids in the Hall (1988), Au-delà du réel - l'aventure continue (1995), Psi Factor, chroniques du paranormal (1996), Une maison de fous (1990) and Mission Genesis (1997). On film, she was featured in Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy (1996), co-starred in National Lampoon's Alarme totale (1995) with Matt Frewer and Tommy Chong and was in the critically received sci-fi horror film Cube (1997). While filming the series Dooley Gardens (1999) in Newfoundland, she got the call and was cast in the seventh and final season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), replacing Terry Farrell as the symbiont host Ezri Dax.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMDE5NTcxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM5NDYyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0207498","name":"Nicole de Boer","idIMDB":"nm0207498"},"actorId":"nm0207498","character":"Leaven","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0208326","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicky Guadagni","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0309914","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nicky Guadagni is an actress, known for Cube (1997), Lars and the Real Girl (2007) and Silent Hill (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0309914","name":"Nicky Guadagni","idIMDB":"nm0309914"},"actorId":"nm0309914","character":"Holloway","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0006914","main":true},{"actorName":"David Hewlett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382110","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2OTYwNTI0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ0OTU0MzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 April 1968","placeOfBirth":" Redhill, Surrey, England, UK","birthName":"David Ian Hewlett","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"David Hewlett was born on April 18, 1968 in Redhill, Surrey, England as David Ian Hewlett.

After training in drama at the University of Exeter and touring North America with a British stage production, Mr. Richings moved to Toronto, Canada in 1984. Within five years, he had become a regular on the second season of the Canadian War of the Worlds (1988) TV series. Other roles followed, and he gained critical acclaim as the bitter, aging punk rock legend Bucky Haight in Bruce McDonald's mock-documentary Hard Core Logo (1996). His appearance in Vincenzo Natali's Cube (1997) was brief, but definitely memorable. In 2000, Mr. Richings appeared as Francis Bellanger, an itinerant railroad worker who falls in love with a prostitute (played by Shirley Henderson), in The Claim (2000), and the role earned him a Genie Award nomination for best supporting actor. His performance as the nearly-blind security guard Otto in Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital (2004) was considered especially impressive by many critics. A busy stage actor as well, Mr. Richings was presented with two Dora Awards in the late 1980s and continues to perform professionally in the Toronto area. He tends to appear in small, experimental theaters and has been known to work for free if he thinks the material is interesting enough. In addition to acting, Mr. Richings has taught seminars and classes on acting and on movement for actors in the Toronto area for nearly twenty years. Mr. Richings is married and has two children. He resides with his family in Toronto.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc5YzExMGItZTNlYy00MzlhLWE0ODUtMzAwZTdkYmM4NjQ2L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE4ODI4ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724995","name":"Julian Richings","idIMDB":"nm0724995"},"actorId":"nm0724995","character":"Alderson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0097811","main":true},{"actorName":"Wayne Robson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0733500","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NjgyNTAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIwOTgxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 April 1946","placeOfBirth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","bio":"Wayne Robson was born on April 29, 1946 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
