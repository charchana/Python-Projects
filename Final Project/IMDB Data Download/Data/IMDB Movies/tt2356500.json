Raised on the Columbia River in Longview, he learned the value of academics and athletics, as the son of two teachers and the second of six siblings. His interest in acting was first sparked during his senior year of high school with the role of the Russian ballet instructor, Boris Kolenkhov, in the comedy \"You Can't Take it With You\". Under the pretense of attending Central Washington University to play football and study business management, he quietly auditioned for every available play, treading the boards for a dozen school productions, from musicals and operas to the more lighthearted fare of Neil Simon. Earning a scholarship to the University of California-Irvine, he sailed through a three-year Master of Fine Arts program, learning from such theatrical luminaries as playwright Edward Albee, Robert Cohen and Jerzy Grotoswski, and supplementing his education through work with the Colorado Shakespeare Festival. He began to audition theatrically before graduation, and by that time, he had his SAG card, an agent and five professional credits, including James Cameron's The Terminator (1984), where he and Bill Paxton's clothes were forcibly removed by a naked Arnold Schwarzenegger. About a year after Arnold took Brian's clothes, Sylvester Stallone wanted a hack at Brian as well. After seven auditions and a screen test, Brian earned the right to get impaled on a meat hook, then burned alive, Stallone's Cobra (1986). This began a string of credits that has left Thompson in and around some of Hollywood's biggest and most projects. Brian has tackled two superhero roles as well: first, Conan the Librarian (1999), starring red in the title role, a PBS special to encourage kids to read. He also earned critical acclaim playing the larger-than-life role of Hercules in Jason and the Argonauts (2000). Probably the first role that demanded use of his classical background as well as his 6' 3\" muscled frame. Brian says that no gym can claim him as a member, and that his physique is kept honed by years of windsurfing and kitesurfing. Taking a curiously \"musical\" approach to his craft, the actor continually seeks fresh rhythms for each new role. Brian verifies his well-rounded nature with a resume that lists such special skills as martial arts (black belt Hapkido), piano and sushi rolling. He currently resides at home with his son Jordan and daughter Daphne.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MDExNzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc2NDYyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0859921","name":"Brian Thompson","idIMDB":"nm0859921"},"actorId":"nm0859921","character":"The Junker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Abplanalp","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5236798","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Joe Abplanalp is an actor and writer, known for An American Terror (2014), Confessions of an Elf (2011) and Listen to Me (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5236798","name":"Joe Abplanalp","idIMDB":"nm5236798"},"actorId":"nm5236798","character":"Ray Falk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Taylor Hulett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5235858","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Taylor Hulett is an actor, known for An American Terror (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5235858","name":"Taylor Hulett","idIMDB":"nm5235858"},"actorId":"nm5235858","character":"Sammy Masters","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nathan Green","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617760","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nathan Green is an actor, known for An American Terror (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617760","name":"Nathan Green","idIMDB":"nm8617760"},"actorId":"nm8617760","character":"Brandon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Miller","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617761","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Miller is an actor, known for An American Terror (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617761","name":"James Miller","idIMDB":"nm8617761"},"actorId":"nm8617761","character":"Miller","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jennifer Wilde","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2651505","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM1ODI5MDQtM2IyYS00NjgxLWIyMDAtZjdhMzliYjUxMjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Jennifer Wilde is an award-winning radio personality whose 20+ year career behind the microphone has spanned the United States (most notably the Monterey, California and Denver, Colorado markets.)

Throughout her radio career, Wilde has performed extensive voice-over work for various national clients. In 2008, she officially added \"Actor\" to her resume as she started to pursue more film roles. Wilde was born in Arlington, Virginia but spent the majority of her childhood growing up in Louisa, Virginia. She's the oldest of 10; 4 brothers and sisters she grew up with, and 5 more that her father adopted later in life. Jennifer always had a love of singing and anything artistic. As a design major, she had dreams of a future in art while always entertaining whatever audience was around whenever she could. She wound up leaving college and her life in Virginia behind when she landed her first full time radio job in Michigan - assuming she could always return to school if the entertainment industry \"didn't work out.\" She hasn't looked back since.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM1ODI5MDQtM2IyYS00NjgxLWIyMDAtZjdhMzliYjUxMjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2651505","name":"Jennifer Wilde","idIMDB":"nm2651505"},"actorId":"nm2651505","character":"Josh's Mom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeff Nicholson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617762","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jeff Nicholson is an actor, known for An American Terror (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617762","name":"Jeff Nicholson","idIMDB":"nm8617762"},"actorId":"nm8617762","character":"Josh's Dad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Roland Salameh","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5237466","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Roland Salameh is an actor and producer, known for An American Terror (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5237466","name":"Roland Salameh","idIMDB":"nm5237466"},"actorId":"nm5237466","character":"TV Thug and ATF Agent 3","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jason Weiss","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617763","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jason Weiss is an actor, known for An American Terror (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8617763","name":"Jason Weiss","idIMDB":"nm8617763"},"actorId":"nm8617763","character":"TV Cop","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Troy Alan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3675395","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzk0NzgxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQxOTYzNw@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Troy Alan is an actor and assistant director, known for Purgatory Cafe (2008), An American Terror (2014) and An Abuse of Power (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzk0NzgxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQxOTYzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3675395","name":"Troy Alan","idIMDB":"nm3675395"},"actorId":"nm3675395","character":"Hardware Store Clerk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alex Demos","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6553629","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Alex Demos is an actor, known for Love Gun (2010) and An American Terror (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6553629","name":"Alex Demos","idIMDB":"nm6553629"},"actorId":"nm6553629","character":"Convenience Store Clerk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Haskins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4464799","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5ODA4MDIwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY4NDA0MzE@._V1_UY44_CR9,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Michael is an actor known for ABC's Killer Women (2014), An American Terror (2014) and The Aviation Cocktail (2012).
