His first band, in 1967, used to go up against (and get badly beaten by) a local band whose members included Greg Hawkes from The Cars, and when he studied music at Prince George's College in Maryland, one of his teachers, Jay Chattaway, went on to become a legendary film/TV composer. He served in the Army from 1969-1971 (wounded in Vietnam) where he was highly decorated and learned how to drive and fire a tank, an incredibly useful skill in daily life today! George describes himself as someone who \"realized late in life\" that acting is the only career in which he could be happy, so plunged in like a man on a mission. In just 12 years, with the help of some great acting coaches (led by Milton Katselas), he's appeared in over 36 films, 14 TV shows, 8 plays and 60+ commercials and print jobs. Recent TV appearances include Vegas, with Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis, The Forgotten with Christian Slater, House with Hugh Laurie, Leverage with Timothy Hutton, e-Ring with Benjamin Bratt, various comedy sketches on Jimmy Kimmel Live, and The Young and the Restless, with series lead Peter Bergman. His films include Don: Plain & Tall (directed by Scott Peters, Exec Prod/Creator The 4400), which won the Best Comedy award at the prestigious Breckenridge Festival of Film, and Ten til Noon starring with Alonso Freeman (Morgan's son), which has won no less than 9 festival awards, including IndieFest. George currently lives in Toluca Lake, Ca. He speaks a little Russian, and still plays his bass(and banjo and guitar) whenever possible.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNTY4NzM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU5MTgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1792670","name":"George Williams","idIMDB":"nm1792670"},"actorId":"nm1792670","character":"Detective Frank Carlson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sean Wing","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1101083","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3NjgyMjI4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIxNTI5Mw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Sean Wing is a singer and American film and television actor who first appeared on an episode of the CBS series Touched by an angel.
