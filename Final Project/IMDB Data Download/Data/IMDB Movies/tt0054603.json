In her prime she was nominated for a Golden Globe and won a \"Best Actress\" award at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival for her stunning performance in The Conjugal Bed (1963) [The Conjugal Bed] with Italy's Ugo Tognazzi. This provocative sex-kitten was born Marina De Poliakoff-Baïdaroff,in Clichy, France on May 10, 1938, the youngest of four acting sisters. Her Russian-born father was a well-established painter in France. While young Marina trained in dance and initially seemed to entertain thoughts of becoming a prima ballerina. But, like her sisters, she discovered a closer kinship to acting. The most outgoing of her siblings, Monica caught the eye of talent agents via more uninhibited roles. Older sister Odile Versois, who possessed a similar feline beauty, was the first of her family to enter pictures. Marina (playing a youthful roller-skater) and another sister Olga made their minor film debuts in Orage d'été (1949) [Summer Storm], which featured Odile. In 1955, at the ripe young age of 17, Marina met and married director/writer/actor Robert Hossein, who featured her prominently and seductively in a number of his films including The Wicked Go to Hell (1955) [The Wicked Go to Hell], as a femme fatale bent on revenge, Pardonnez nos offenses (1956), Double Agents (1959) [Double Agents] and, notably, Night Is Not for Sleep (1958) [Nude in a White Car], which co-starred sister Odile. She had two sons by Hossein but the marriage lasted only a few years. Gracing both French and Italian productions throughout most of her career, Marina was not shy at playing unsympathetic, even caustic characters, and proved adept at both saucy comedy and edgy drama, appearing for such notable directors as Jean-Luc Godard and Christian-Jaque. Playing opposite some of Europe's finest leading men, she was a vision in loveliness alongside Marcello Mastroianni in Black Feathers (1952) [Black Feathers], a touching WWII drama, she also co-starred with Italy's top character actor Aldo Fabrizi in Too Young for Love (1953) [Too Young for Love]. One of her rare English-speaking appearances came with Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight (1965) [Chimes at Midnight]. Her later years included much TV. Married four times, Vlady was the widow of heralded Russian poet/songwriter/actor Vladimir Vysotskiy who allegedly died of heart failure in 1980 at the age 42 after years of alcohol and drug abuse. Her fourth husband passed away in 2003.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MDUyODU5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczMzcxNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0900557","name":"Marina Vlady","nicknames":["\"Miss Body\" of 1960."],"idIMDB":"nm0900557"},"actorId":"nm0900557","character":"Juliette","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Macha Méril","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0617736","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU2MDMwMDQ5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM0NzI0MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 September 1940","placeOfBirth":" Rabat, Morocco","birthName":"Marie-Madeleine Gagarine","bio":"Macha Méril was born on September 3, 1940 in Rabat, Morocco as Marie-Madeleine Gagarine.

Among all these activities Christian Alers always privileged the stage, appearing in countless plays, most of which light comedies. He particularly shone in plays by Alexandre Breffort (\"Impasse de la fidélité\"), Michel André (\"Virginie\", \"Deux imbéciles heureux\") or Marc Camoletti (\"Boeing-boeing\", \"La bonne adresse\"). In a more poetic register, he was also excellent in André Roussin's \"Un amour qui ne finit pas\". Which does not mean that Alers, even if he did it only occasionally, shied away from hardcore dramas. He proved he could be convincing in \"serious\" works such as \"Comme avant mieux qu'avant\" by Luigi Pirandello or \"Les étendards du roi\" and \"Le cinquième cavalier\", both by Bolivian playwright Adolfo Costa du Rels. His most impressive performance remains Joseph Staline in Vladimir Volkoff's \"Yalta ou le partage du monde\" Like many other stage actors, Christian Alers, made films in parallel with his theatrical career, but, as was the case for a lot of them, this second career proved globally disappointing. Sure Alers made movies as of 1945 (he was 23 then and as skinny as a rake) but his first roles were as thin as his post-war years figure. Things seemed to change in 1950 when he was given the opportunity to top the bill in André Cerf's adaptation of the famous Belgian play Le mariage de Mademoiselle Beulemans (1950). His interpretation of Suzanne Beulemens' French crush was fine but, for some mysterious reason, it was an experience with no tomorrow. Indeed, from then on the actor would get only small or tiny parts, sometimes in major films (Philippe in Éric Rohmer's Le signe du lion (1962); the stranger in 'Michel Deville''s Adorable menteuse (1962); young Isabelle Huppert's father in Bertrand Blier's Going Places (1974)...) but never with sufficient screen time to be able to prove himself. There were two exceptions to this rule which could have changed things, two leading roles in French-style noir movies (Force 8 (1974) and La cassure (1981)). Unfortunately, both films flopped and that was that with a prestigious film career. But Christian Alers never lacked work on the boards. Moreover, television enabled him to acquire a wide popularity thanks to series like _\"Les saintes chéries\" (1965-1970)_ or _Marie Pervenche (1984-1991)_. On the other hand, he was particularly colorful as the plump, gray-haired (this was not 1945 any more!) father-figure sidekick to the heroine in two sentimental historical series by Marion Sarraut, Marianne, une étoile pour Napoléon (1983) and Catherine (1986) Christian Alers was therefore a happy and fulfilled actor when he retired in the 1990s. This faithful companion of the performing arts for 45 years could then take his bow with with the consciousness of work well done as well as the recognition from the spectators.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0018093","name":"Christian Alers","idIMDB":"nm0018093"},"actorId":"nm0018093","character":"Robert - l'inconnu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-François Calvé","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0131001","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 September 1925","placeOfBirth":" Athis-Mons, Seine-et-Oise, France","birthName":"Jean-François Robert Alexis Calves","bio":"Jean-François Calvé was born on September 23, 1925 in Athis-Mons, Seine-et-Oise, France as Jean-François Robert Alexis Calves.

The Paris-born actress, however, was actually the first to become a star and had quite a formidable career of her own in the 1960s until it was cut short. Born into a theatrical family in 1942 (her father was actor Maurice Dorléac), Francoise first appeared on stage at the age of 10. Entering the film industry with the movie short Mensonges (1957), she studied at the Conservatoire d'Art Dramatique (1959-1961) and had modeled for Christian Dior by the time she started making any kind of cinematic impact. Slim, gamine, pale-skinned and a real brunette stunner, Francoise graced a number of movies before hitting celebrity stardom with François Truffaut's melodrama The Soft Skin (1964) [La Peau Douce] and the classic James Bond-like spy spoof That Man from Rio (1964) [L'Homme de Rio], both released in 1964. The two films showed the polar sides of Francoise's incredible allure and talent. In the former she played an airline stewardess who falls into a tragic affair with a married businessman (Jean Desailly) and in the latter she played a fun and flaky heroine opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo. Unlike Catherine, Francoise proved a carefree, outgoing presence both on and off camera. Known for her chic, stylish ways and almost unbridled sense of joie-de-vivre, she continued making strong marks as the adulterous wife in Roman Polanski's black comedy Cul-De-Sac (1966) and even joined Gene Kelly, George Chakiris, and her sister, who was now a cinematic star by this time too, in the rather candy-coated The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) [Les Demoiselle de Rochefort], a colorful movie which paid homage to the Hollywood musical. She and Catherine, who looked quite similar, played singing twins who dream about living in Paris. Her fun and funny side was always an asset and often revealed as in the films as Arsène Lupin contre Arsène Lupin (1962) and Male Hunt (1964) [La Chasse à l'Homme ]. Branching out now in such non-French movies as Genghis Khan (1965), Where the Spies Are (1966), and Billion Dollar Brain (1967), the luminous Francoise was on the brink of international stardom when her rental car flipped and burned on a roadway in Nice, France on June 26, 1967. She was near completion of the last film mentioned at the time the accident occurred. Her part in the movie was left intact. Her early death at age 25 most certainly robbed the cinema of a tried and true talent and incomparably beautiful mademoiselle who showed every sign of taking Hollywood by storm, as Catherine later did.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NTM3MDU3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDkyNDI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233753","name":"Françoise Dorléac","idIMDB":"nm0233753"},"actorId":"nm0233753","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0054603","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054603","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 45 min (105 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.5","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"124","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0046889","name":"Eléfilm"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["blonde"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 11:18:58"}}
