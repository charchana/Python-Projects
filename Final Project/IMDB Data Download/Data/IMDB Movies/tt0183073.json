When he was 16 he had taken up motorsports and had begun racing motorcycles and cars professionally. Shortly after this he got into acting for films. Spotting that most stuntmen in Taiwan specialised in martial arts and such, Ko became one of the first stuntmen to focus on stunts involving motorcycles and cars. This area of work soon allowed him to work behind the camera as a stunt arranger. Outside of movie work his most memorable achievement came in 1997 when he used a modified Mitsubishi to jump 50 metres over China's yellow river. The jump was carried live on television and he dedicated it to the handover of Hong Kong back to China. He also announced his retirement and spent his time raising money for charities. He was also a singer and enjoyed fishing.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461918","name":"Blackie Shou Liang Ko","nicknames":["Asia's Evel Knievel"],"idIMDB":"nm0461918"},"actorId":"nm0461918","character":"Single Ball","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jerry Lamb","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0482970","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNiMDBiNWItNzQyNC00ZDhmLTkwYjAtN2U3MzhkZTdkZTE5L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MTI5NzQ@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 September 1970","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong","bio":"Jerry Lamb was born on September 29, 1970 in Hong Kong.
