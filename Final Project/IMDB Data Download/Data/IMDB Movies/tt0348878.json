In 2000, Nicole moved to Los Angeles, CA where she was offered a prestigious job working as a personal assistant and nanny to Academy Award Winners Angelina Jolie-Pitt and Brad Pitt and their family. Her work with the Jolie-Pitts enabled her to travel around the world and offered many unforgettable and invaluable life experiences. The Jolie-Pitts were gracious and inspiring employers.
