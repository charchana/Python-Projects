Gary's career on film began in 1974 when he was cast by director Dick Donner in the television movie \"Senior Year\", which went on to become the CBS TV series \"Sons and Daughters\". Gary became a contract player at Universal Studios until the series was canceled after one season; 2 days later he was cast by director Mark Rydell and producer Mike Nicols to play Willie Lawrence in the critically acclaimed ABC series \"Family\", for which he won an EMMY Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1977. After a successful five season run on \"Family\", Gary went on to do television movies, features and an impressive array of guest parts on almost every major TV series in the '80s and '90s. \"Family\" also enjoyed a very successful run as a syndicated series in Europe during those years, as evidence by the amount of fan mail he and the rest of the cast received from viewers overseas. Also a writer, Gary has written a stack of scripts and is currently writing his first novel. Married for thirty years to producer Carroll Newman, they have one daughter who is a senior in the USC School of Film, who intends to follow in her parents footsteps, as well as her grandfather's, Academy Award-winning composer Lional Newman.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTM4NTA5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjA3MjU3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290933","name":"Gary Frank","idIMDB":"nm0290933"},"actorId":"nm0290933","character":"Barry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ray Parker Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662018","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyOTIzMDUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYzMDIzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR7,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 May 1954","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Ray Erskine Parker Jr.","bio":"Ray Parker Jr. was born on May 1, 1954 in Detroit, Michigan, USA as Ray Erskine Parker Jr. He has been married to Elaine Parker since June 12, 1994.

Jan-Michael Vincent originally made a name for himself portraying rebellious young men bucking the system, as in The Tribe (1970), La route de la violence (1975) and Baby Blue Marine (1976) or as a man of action on either side of the law, as in The Mechanic (1972), Vigilante Force (1976) and The Winds of War (1983). He was born in Denver, Colorado, in July 1944, and was finishing a stint in the National Guard when a talent scout was struck by his all-American looks. He made his first appearance on-screen in The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Chinese Junk (1967), before appearing in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in \"Danger Island\" on the Hanna-Barbera kids TV show The Banana Splits Adventure Hour (1968). He remained very busy during the 1970s, appearing in high-profile productions alongside such stars as John Wayne, Rock Hudson, Charles Bronson, Slim Pickens and Robert Mitchum. In 1984 Vincent landed the role of Stringfellow Hawke in the helicopter action series Supercopter (1984), co-starring Ernest Borgnine. The show wrapped after three seasons and from then on he was primarily appearing in low-budget, B-grade action and sci-fi films, including Alienator (1990), The Divine Enforcer (1992), Deadly Heroes (1993) and Lethal Orbit (1996). His last film to date was the woeful gang movie White Boy (2002), and ongoing health issues and personal problems seem to preclude his return to the screen. Vincent will be best remembered by film fans as a smirking, apprentice hit man to Charles Bronson in The Mechanic (1972), as feisty \"Matt\" in the superb surf movie Big Wednesday (1978) with Gary Busey and William Katt, or as rebel trucker Carol Jo Hummer battling corruption in La route de la violence (1975).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2ODYwMjc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTc0ODM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001821","name":"Jan-Michael Vincent","idIMDB":"nm0001821"},"actorId":"nm0001821","character":"Parker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Frances Foster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0287804","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 June 1924","placeOfBirth":" Yonkers, New York, USA","birthName":"Frances Brown","bio":"Frances Foster was born on June 11, 1924 in Yonkers, New York, USA as Frances Brown.

Born in Washington, D.C., Todd spent two years on a scholarship at the University of Connecticut, which, in turn, led to a scholarship from the renowned Eugene O'Neill National Theatre Institute. It proved to be the foundation for intense stints at the Hartman Conservatory in Stamford, Connecticut and the Trinity Square Repertory Theatre Conservatory in Providence, Rhode Island. Todd appeared in dozens of classical and many experimental plays, yet still managed to find time to teach playwriting to high school students in the Hartford public school system. Todd's extensive credits exemplify his versatility. They include such film classics as The Rock (1996), The Crow (1994), Lean on Me (1989), Bird (1988), Night of the Living Dead (1990), Destination finale (2000), the multiple Academy Award winning Oliver Stone film Platoon (1986) and Le secret (2000), which was nominated and screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Todd's recent films include the independent film Silence (2002) and Final Destination 2 (2003). He has had prominent guest starring roles in numerous critically-acclaimed television series, including recurring on Boston Public (2000), For the People (2002) and The District (2000), as well as NYPD Blue (1993), Smallville (2001), Law & Order (1990), Crossing Jordan (2001), Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) and The X-Files (1993). Todd recurred on three incarnations of \"Star Trek\" and guest starred on Xena: Warrior Princess (1995) and episodes of CSI: Miami (2002) and Andromeda (2000). His television movies include starring roles in True Women (1997), Black Fox (1995), Butter (1998), Ivory Hunters (1990), Babylon 5: A Call to Arms (1999) and Control Factor (2003). Todd's considerable theatre credits include the world premiere of award-winning playwright August Wilson's \"King Hedley II\", where he originated the title role in Pittsburgh, Seattle and Boston. Variety commented: \"Todd's King Hedley dominates the stage. A sour-faced mix of rage and resolve, anger and vulnerability. Todd's Hedley was a memorable tour-de-force even on opening.\" He also received a coveted Helen Hayes nomination for his performance in Athol Fugard's \"The Captain's Tiger at La Jolla, the Manhattan Theatre Club and the Kennedy Center. Other theatre credits include \"Les Blancs\", \"Playboy of the West Indies\", \"Othello\", \"Zooman and the Sign\", award-winning playwright Keith Glover's \"Dark Paradise\", \"Aida\" (on Broadway), and most recently, \"Levee James\" for the prestigious Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference and The New Dramatist Guild.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNTI1Njc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4NzcyNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865302","name":"Tony Todd","idIMDB":"nm0865302"},"actorId":"nm0865302","character":"The Count","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0502580","main":true},{"actorName":"Stacey Dash","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001107","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMwNzY2MTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ3NTgyMTE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 January 1967","placeOfBirth":" The Bronx, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Stacey Lauretta Dash","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Stacey Dash was born in the Bronx, New York.

He joined the agency as a talent rep in 2009. Theo's journey into the entertainment industry began at the age of 12 when he became a child actor and landed a role in \"Police Academy 3: Back In Traning\". The South Bronx, NY native went on to star in several film, television, print and theater productions from New York to California and even Canada. At the age of 16, his family relocated to Virginia Beach, VA. He took up an interest in music and began interning at a recording studio called \"TMH (The Music House)\". Before long, the studio owner, David Velazquez, taught Theo how to engineer and produce recordings of his own, making him the head engineer and business manager of the studio. In his early twenties, he entered into a business partnership with David and they began a production company called \"QSL Entertainmentt\". Theo started a hip hop group named \"Black Reign\" with his friends Shante \"L.U.V.\" Holland and Donshay \"Big Qweezy\" Gregory. Over time, Velazquez decided to take a different direction in business and turned over the majority of his interest in QSL and TMH over to the trio. They went on to sell thousands of CDs throughout the East Coast and perform regularly over a ten year span which even led them to win the 2005 Blendzville Award for Best Independent Label in Hampton Roads, VA. In 2005, Theo joined Studio Center Total Production as a voice over talent and began doing radio and television commercials for entities such as McDonalds, Church's Chicken and Carmax, as well as others. He decided to try his hand at the acting game once again and moved to Los Angeles in January of 2007. Once there, opportunities on the business side of entertainment began to unfold at neck-breaking speed. He met casting director/producer, Ann Ross and writer/director, Tim White, who showed him the ropes of the other side of the movie game. After working with them on their film, \"Gurdian\", he decided to form his own company, TEAM Casting and Production, LLC.. Within his first year in CA, Theo dove into several positions in the industry from acting to casting to talent management and film production. He was approached by his brother-in-law, entertainment lawyer Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen, LLC in Boston, MA, to seek out aspiring producers looking for financing for film and TV projects. Their first successful venture was for promotion and advertising funds for the Bill Duke directed, 20th Century Fox project, \"Cover\" through producers Kenneth Dixon and Gus Blackmon.
