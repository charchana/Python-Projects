La Doña, as the star was known after the character of her 1943 movie Doña Bárbara, starred in 47 movies, most of them forgettable except for her presence in them. More a star than an actress, she constructed an image of a tough woman, a sort of one-liner she-male that went beyond the traditional role of Latin American women. Her marriage to Agustín Lara the most popular Latin composer from the 30s to the 60s, was a great event itself. Her fame went beyond Mexico to Latin America, Spain, France and Italy. She always refused to learn English, so she never acted in any English language movie. That's the main reason why her fame was related almost exclusively to Latin countries. After her last film, she was linked to a number of film projects, but never came back to the screen. Her last performance was on a Mexican historic soap opera, in 1970.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNiOTMzNTYtNjJjMC00OTczLTk1MTUtNDcyZjQ3NzY1OGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299661","name":"María Félix","nicknames":["María Bonita","La Doña"],"idIMDB":"nm0299661"},"actorId":"nm0299661","character":"Lola de Castro de la Fuente de Extremadura 'La Belle Abbesse'","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0492840","main":true},{"actorName":"Anna Amendola","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0024577","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Anna Amendola is an actress, known for French Cancan (1955), Avenida Roma, 66 (1958) and We, the Women (1953).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0024577","name":"Anna Amendola","idIMDB":"nm0024577"},"actorId":"nm0024577","character":"Esther Georges","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-Roger Caussimon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0146613","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 July 1918","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","bio":"Jean-Roger Caussimon was born on July 24, 1918 in Paris, France.
