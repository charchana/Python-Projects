In 1903 he scored a lasting success in vaudeville with an act called \"Johnny's New Car\" which he performed for twenty years. In 1923, he signed with Principal Pictures as a series star, but transferred to Keystone when Mack Sennett bought the contract. Early in his film career, he had the good fortune to work regularly with the young Frank Capra. The two developed a unique character of an innocent man-child who found himself in dramatic and hazardous circumstances with only providence and good luck making him come out on top. This character clicked with the public and Langdon enjoyed a streak of artistic and commercial successes using it with Capra's direction. Unfortunately, he began to take the praise of his talent too seriously and broke with Capra so he could hog all the glory himself with his films. This proved to be a disasterous mistake as his first film \"Three's a Crowd\", a sickeningly sentimental film that plainly showed that he did not even approach the talent and skill of Capra which was needed to keep his character style viable. It has been also speculated the public was getting tired of Langdon's character, which contributed to Langdon's first solo film being an artistic and commericial failure. That film was the first in a series of bombs that ruined Langdon's career and relegated him to minor films from third string companies for the rest of his life.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUxOTUyMjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ0MjI1MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003377","name":"Harry Langdon","nicknames":["The Sad Clown","The Little Elf"],"idIMDB":"nm0003377"},"actorId":"nm0003377","character":"Dobbs, the butler","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"May Wallace","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908784","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 August 1877","placeOfBirth":" Russiaville, Indiana, USA","birthName":"May Maddox","bio":"May Wallace was born on August 23, 1877 in Russiaville, Indiana, USA as May Maddox.

Ricketts began his show-business career as an actor on the London stage, and gained a reputation as one of the best Shakespearean actors of his day. Ricketts never seemed to rest, working up until a few days before his death in 1939. He left for work one day with a bad cold, which quickly developed into pneumonia. His health went downhill rapidly and he died only a few days later. His wife, the actress Mrs. Tom Ricketts (aka Josephine Ditt), was not notified of his death at the time; she was still suffering from the effects of a stroke that she had in December of 1938.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjYwZjgyM2ItYjE2OC00YTU0LTk1NDQtY2FlMDU2ZjJiYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0725529","name":"Tom Ricketts","idIMDB":"nm0725529"},"actorId":"nm0725529","character":"Edgar, the old beau","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Judith Barrett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057184","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2OGUyMzEtNzZmMi00OTllLWJhZjctMzE4OWMzMWI5Mzk4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 February 1909","placeOfBirth":" Arlington, Texas, USA","birthName":"Lucille Kelley","bio":"Judith Barrett was born on February 2, 1909 in Arlington, Texas, USA as Lucille Kelley.
