Born Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta on September 23rd, 1917 in Hidalgo, Mexico, he was the fifth of seven children and the family moved to Mexico City in the 1920s where Rodolfo became keenly interested in several sports including baseball, gridiron and eventually wrestling. Wrestling took off in the early 1930s in Mexico after several promoters had witnessed events in Texas, and in Mexico the sport eventually became known as \"Luche Libre\", literally \"free fight,\" Mexico's version of professional wrestling. Rodolfo's first wrestling appearance was alleged to have been at Arena Peralvillo Cozumel on June 28th, 1934, and he soon became an active figure on the Mexican wrestling circuit under various names including \"El Hombre Rojo\", \"Rudy Guzman\", \"El Demonio Negro\" and \"El Murcielago II\". After initially competing as a \"rudo\" ( bad or \"heel\" wrestler ), Rodolfo became a \"técnico\" (good or \"babyface\" wrestler) and that's the way he remained for the next fifty years. In 1942, his manager, Don Jesus Lomeli, was assembling a team of masked silver wrestlers, and wanted Rodolfo to join the ensemble. He was given the choice of three stage names, \"El Diablo\" (The Devil), \"El Santo\" (The Saint) or \"El Angel\" (The Angel). Rodolfo chose \"El Santo\" and first wrestled under that name at Arena Mexico on June 26th, 1942. During the 1950s, a Mexican artist named Jose Guadalupe Cruz seized upon Santo's popularity with the local populace and began a \"fumetti\" style \"Santo\" comic book that was to run for over 35 years and had Santo fighting villains both real and supernatural! Santo had resisted previous advances to appear in serials or motion pictures, however he finally reneged and his first film appearance's were in the ultra low budget Santo contra los zombies (1962), Santo contre l'esprit du mal (1961) and Santo contra hombres infernales (1961), all shot in Cuba just prior to Fidel Castro seizing power! The Mexican fans flocked to see Santo in his role as a crime fighting super hero on the cinema screen, and his movie career literally exploded overnight! Over the next three decades Santo starred in dozens of films, often teaming to fight evil with fellow masked wrestler the Alejandro Cruz (aka \"Blue Demon). Santo's most popular films include Santo Versus the Vampire Women (1962), Santo and Blue Demon Against the Monsters (1970) and Santo y Blue Demon contra el doctor Frankenstein (1974). However, their was a change of power in Mexican government in 1976, and the new administration frowned upon the masked wrestler genre, and film funding was canceled which effectively spelled the demise of the genre. Santo's final film appearance was in La furia de los karatecas (1982) filmed in Florida, and Santo officially retired from wrestling/acting on July 26th, 1982 (at the age of 65!). After nearly fifty years years of never being seen without his trademark mask, Santo appeared on the Mexican TV talk show \"Contrapunto\" on January 26th 1984, and without warning, he unmasked and revealed his face. Sadly, Santo passed away from a heart attack less than two weeks later on February 5th, 1984. The Mexican people were shattered by the death of their idol, and his funeral was attended by tens of thousands of fans, plus many wrestling identities, and Santo was finally laid to rest at a mausoleum in Mexico City wearing his beloved silver mask. Santo had married twice during his life. Firstly to Maria de los Angeles Rodriguez Montano and then secondly to Eva Enriquetta Vallejo Vadager, and he fathered eleven children. More than an actor or wrestler, he was a much loved and venerated cultural icon to the Mexican people and beyond.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc0YzcyZDUtMTc4Ni00MzA3LWJjNTQtYjUxNjYwOGMyNDdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0763803","name":"Santo","idIMDB":"nm0763803"},"actorId":"nm0763803","character":"Santo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0051806","main":true},{"actorName":"Nelson Velázquez","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0892821","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nelson Velázquez is an actor, known for Chanoc y el hijo del Santo contra los vampiros asesinos (1981), Escuadrón suicida (1991) and Virgil, la malédiction (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0892821","name":"Nelson Velázquez","idIMDB":"nm0892821"},"actorId":"nm0892821","character":"Chanoc","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0168490","main":true},{"actorName":"Rubi Re","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0713722","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Rubi Re is an actress, known for Hermelinda linda (1984), Santo contra el asesino de la T.V.
