Born in 1930, he trained at the Paris Conservatoire but had to halt his studies due to military service. Relocating to Paris, he developed a minor name for himself in cabaret and stage plays. He also worked with the Grenier-Hussenot company at this time and acted in TV drama. Throughout his career Rochefort would return sporadically to the theatre as both actor and director. Films took his immediate focus in the late 50s and he became an audience favorite in roguish costumers and adventure films, particularly those of director Philippe De Broca, including Swords of Blood (1962), Up to His Ears (1965) and The Devil by the Tail (1969). By the 70s, Rochefort's reputation as a comedy star of sex farces and black comedies was firmly established, culminating with his classic roles in The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1972), Conspiratia (1973), Le fantôme de la liberté (1974), Affreux, sales et méchants (1976) and Pardon Mon Affaire (1976). He won the Cesar Award (French equivalent of the 'Oscar') for best supporting actor in The Clockmaker of St. Paul (1974) and the best actor trophy for Le Crabe-Tambour (1977). Though he branched out internationally in later years, he earned more kudos for his work in French-made films, especially those directed by Patrice Leconte: Tandem (1987), The Hairdresser's Husband (1990) and the Oscar-nominated Ridicule (1996). Most recently he won praise co-starring as a retired teacher of poetry opposite actor Johnny Hallyday in Man on the Train (2002). Despite his obvious comedic electricity, he has touched audiences as well playing dying naval captains, paraplegics, and timorous, elderly dreamers, often drawing both humor and pathos simultaneously from his characters. Not as well known by America's standards, his sunken, weary features, ever-searching eyes, ever-present moustache and prominent nose are unmistakable in the over 80 films he's graced. A lifetime dream was to play Don Quixote on film and his wish was nearly fulfilled until he took seriously ill and the project had to be indefinitely shelved after only a few days of filming. Rochefort received a special life's achievement Cesar award in 1999.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTY0MDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkxMTY1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734000","name":"Jean Rochefort","nicknames":["Mon petit Jeannot","Jeannot"],"idIMDB":"nm0734000"},"actorId":"nm0734000","character":"Jean","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Laurent Terzieff","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0856187","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMjI1NzAxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQxMDAwMjE@._V1_UY44_CR24,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 June 1935","placeOfBirth":" Toulouse, Haute-Garonne, France","birthName":"Laurent Tchemerzine","bio":"Laurent Terzieff was born on June 27, 1935 in Toulouse, Haute-Garonne, France as Laurent Tchemerzine.

When discussing the acting career of Arno, one can be brief. His acting has been limited to three movies. He played his first part in Skin (1987), a Belgian movie directed by Guido Henderickx for which he also composed the music. Ten years later he also appeared in Camping Cosmos (1996), directed by Jan Bucquoy, the terror of the Belgian movie scene and in _Alors voilà (1997)_, directed by Michel Piccoli. It is no surprise that his filmography as an actor is so limited, since Arno is basically a rock musician. So he deserves more credits as a composer. He wrote his first soundtrack for the Belgian movie Le concert d'un homme seul in 1978. Later, he composed soundtracks for some French movies such as 'Merci la vie' (1991) and Personne ne m'aime (1994). In 1996 Arno also sang the Flemish versions of the main tracks of the Disney animation movie Toy Story (1995). But he is most famous as a singer. He joined his first group 'Freckle Face' in 1970 and later formed a duo with Paul Decoutere as 'Tjens-Couter'. In 1980 he formed the famous band 'TC Matic', which was very influential in Europe. Classic TC Matic songs include 'Oh la la la', 'Putain putain' and 'Elle adore le noir'. The band split in 1986 after releasing four albums. In 1988 he released his first solo album. During the following years he launched several records, including 'Ratata' (1990) and 'Idiots savants' (1993). He became very famous in France after the release of 'Arno à la française' (1995) and 'A poil commercial' (1999). 'Charles Ernest', his latest record released in 2002, contains a duet with French singer Jane Birkin and a cover of the Rolling Stones song 'Mother's little helper'. In 2002 he received the very prestigious French decoration of the Legion d'Honneur for his whole career. Recently he has been given a honorary citizenship of his native city Ostend.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003073","name":"Arno","idIMDB":"nm0003073"},"actorId":"nm0003073","character":"Arno","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bouli Lanners","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0099521","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1OTUwMDE2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI3OTA1Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 May 1965","placeOfBirth":" Moresnet-Chapelle, Belgium","birthName":"Philippe Lanners","bio":"Bouli Lanners was born on May 20, 1965 in Moresnet-Chapelle, Belgium as Philippe Lanners.
