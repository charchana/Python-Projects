He tells his guests of his travels in his time machine, the work about which his friends knew. They were also unbelieving, and skeptical of any practical use if it did indeed work. George knew that his machine was stationary in geographic position, but he did not account for changes in what happens over time to that location. He also learns that the machine is not impervious and he is not immune to those who do not understand him or the machine's purpose. George tells his friends that he did not find the Utopian society he so wished had developed. He mentions specifically a civilization several thousand years into the future which consists of the subterranean morlocks and the surface dwelling eloi, who on first glance lead a carefree life. Despite all these issues, love can still bloom over the spread of millennia.","simplePlot":"A man's vision for a utopian society is disillusioned when travelling forward into time reveals a dark and dangerous society.","actors":[{"actorName":"Rod Taylor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001792","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMTY0MTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUxNjU5MzE@._V1_UY44_CR5,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 January 1930","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Rodney Sturt Taylor","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Suave and handsome Australian actor who came to Hollywood in the 1950s, and built himself up from a supporting actor into taking the lead in several well-remembered movies. Arguably his most fondly remembered role was that as George (Herbert George Wells), the inventor, in George Pal's spectacular The Time Machine (1960). As the movie finished with George, and his best friend Filby Alan Young seemingly parting forever, both actors were brought back together in 1993 to film a 30 minute epilogue to the original movie! Taylor's virile, matinée idol looks also assisted him in scoring the lead of Mitch Brenner in Alfred Hitchcock's creepy thriller The Birds (1963), the role of Jane Fonda's love interest in Sunday in New York (1963), the title role in John Ford's biopic of Irish playwright Sean O'Casey in Young Cassidy (1965), and a co-starring role in The Train Robbers (1973) with John Wayne. Taylor also appeared as Bette Davis future son-in-law in the well-received film The Catered Affair (1956). He also gave a sterling performance as the German-American Nazi Major trying to fool James Garner in 36 Hours (1964). Later Taylor made many westerns and action movies during the 1960s and 1970s; however, none of them were much better than \"B pictures\" and failed to push his star to the next level. Aditionally, Taylor was cast as the lead in several TV series including Bearcats! (1971), Masquerade (1983), and Outlaws (1986); however, none of them truly ignited viewer interest, and they were canceled after only one or two seasons. Most fans would agree that Rod Taylor's last great role was in the wonderful Australian film The Picture Show Man (1977), about a traveling side show bringing \"moving pictures\" to remote towns in the Australian outback.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMTY0MTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUxNjU5MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001792","name":"Rod Taylor","idIMDB":"nm0001792"},"actorId":"nm0001792","character":"H.

As a boy, he suffered from severe asthma, which kept him bedridden for long periods of time but encouraged his love of radio. By age 13, Young had become a radio performer, and by age 17, he was writing and performing in his own radio show for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The show was broadcast in the U.S. and led to an invitation to New York, initiating Young's career as an \"All-American boy,\" despite his non-American origins and a vestigial Scots accent. He became popular on American radio from 1944 to 1949 with his \"Alan Young Radio Show,\" but when radio began to lose its popularity and his show was canceled, Young decided to put together a comedy act and tour the U.S. theater circuit. After this experience, he wrote a television pilot for CBS in 1950, which resulted in The Alan Young Show (1950). The show was a well-received live revue that ran for 3 years, earned a couple of Emmy Awards, and garnered Young a star on the \"Walk of Fame.\" However, the strain of writing and performing a weekly show got to Young, and the quality of the show declined, leading to his departure from the show and its cancellation. In the meantime, based on his popularity on radio and television, Young had established a film career, starting with his debut in Margie (1946) followed by Chicken Every Sunday (1949), Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1949), Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick (1952), Androcles and the Lion (1952), Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), Tom Thumb (1958), and The Time Machine (1960). In the early 1960s, Young landed his best-known role, Wilbur Post, in the popular television series Mister Ed (1958), which ran for 5 years. Since then, Young has made a number of television and film appearances but is known primarily for his voice characterizations in cartoons, especially as Scrooge McDuck in DuckTales (1987).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MTU1NDE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQwODk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949241","name":"Alan Young","nicknames":["Al Young"],"idIMDB":"nm0949241"},"actorId":"nm0949241","character":"David Filby / James Filby","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010305","main":true},{"actorName":"Yvette Mimieux","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0590796","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc2NTgwMzYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA0NTcxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 January 1942","placeOfBirth":" Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Yvette Carmen Mimieux","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Yvette Mimieux was born on January 8, 1942 in Hollywood, California, USA as Yvette Carmen Mimieux.
