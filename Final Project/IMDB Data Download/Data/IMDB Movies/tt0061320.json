He began working in theatre and television, where he was soon noticed as one of the most promising actors of his generation. After several supporting appearances in film, he reached notoriety with the character of Ramón Rojo in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964). This success was doubled in Leone's next film, For a Few Dollars More (1965). The following ten years would be the most intense of Volontè career. L'armée Brancaleone (1966) (directed by Mario Monicelli) was the most successful Italian movie of the year, We Still Kill the Old Way (1967) (directed by Elio Petri) won the Grand Prix du Scenario at the Cannes Film Festival, and Volontè won his first Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon - the most presitgious acting award in Italy) in 1970 for Enquête sur un citoyen au-dessus de tout soupçon (1970) (also directed by Petri), making him an international star. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and two Italian Golden Globes, including one for his performance. In 1972, he starred in two Italian movies as the protagonist: Petri's Lulu the Tool (1971) and Francesco Rosi's The Mattei Affair (1972), both of which win the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, where he also wins a Special Mention. In his life, Volontè won a huge number of other prizes and honours, becoming one of the most celebrated Italian actors of the seventies, and challenging Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni as the most popular Italian actor. He died in Greece in 1994.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NTU2NDU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNjMyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002231","name":"Gian Maria Volontè","idIMDB":"nm0002231"},"actorId":"nm0002231","character":"Prof. Paolo Laurana","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Irene Papas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0660327","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODEzNTI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg3ODIyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 September 1926","placeOfBirth":" Chilimodion, Corynth, Greece","birthName":"Eiríni Lelékou","bio":"Irene Papas was born on September 3, 1926 in Chilimodion, Corynth, Greece as Eiríni Lelékou.

His passion for the stage had begun with performing in university plays. This paved the way to a scholarship at the Rome Academy of Dramatic Art (Accademia d'arte drammatica). Before long, he was expelled for appearing with a professional theatrical troupe and proceeded to join the National Theatre, and, a year later, the company of Vivi Gioi. As the silver screen beckoned, Ferzetti made his motion picture debut at the age of seventeen in Luigi Chiarini's Via delle cinque lune (1942). After a succession of supporting roles and uncredited bits as an extra, his first genuine lead came opposite Gina Lollobrigida in the comedy The Wayward Wife (1953). This role won him an award from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists and established his reputation as a major romantic star. In its wake came steady offers for more challenging roles across diverse genres. He played the central character, respectively in Puccini (1953) and Sins of Casanova (1955) before excelling as a struggling artist in Michelangelo Antonioni's Le Amiche (1955). He impressed again as the failed architect and irresolute playboy Sandro in the controversial L'Avventura (1960), again directed by Antonioni. By the early 60's, Ferzetti's distinguished features had him frequently cast in provocative political dramas as flawed men hiding behind charming, sophisticated facades. He also acquired an international following with character roles in Torpedo Bay (1963), I Spy (1965), as a cynical railway baron in Sergio Leone's epic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and as syndicate boss Marc-Ange Draco joining forces with James Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) (his accent was deemed to be too strong, however, and he was dubbed by David de Keyser ). Ferzetti's career continued to prosper during the 70's and beyond,despite occasional missteps (including the incongruously cast Hitler: The Last Ten Days (1973) and the box office disaster that was Inchon (1981). During his final years, he restricted his appearances predominantly to the small screen.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNTAxODYzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODgyMzY0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275213","name":"Gabriele Ferzetti","idIMDB":"nm0275213"},"actorId":"nm0275213","character":"Avvocato Rosello","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Laura Nucci","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0637713","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 February 1913","placeOfBirth":" Carrara, Tuscany, Italy","birthName":"Maria Laura Lodovici","bio":"Laura Nucci was born on February 26, 1913 in Carrara, Tuscany, Italy as Maria Laura Lodovici.
