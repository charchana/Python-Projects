He was born in Sydney, Australia and ultimately educated at The SCOTS College, wherafter he retains an immunity to - and perhaps even a fondness of - bagpipes. His USA career began in 2009 when Rob Reiner cast him as his romantic lead Bryce in \"Flipped\". Soon after this, Callan was cast as Sam, in Dreamworks sci fi, \"I Am Number Four\". Baz Lurhmann followed in casting Callan as the Young Gatsby to Leonardo Di Caprio's lead role in \"The Great Gatsby\". In 2013 Callan also worked with Samuel L Jackson in a support lead role of Oburi filming \"Kite,\" followed by the lead role of Sean Flynn with Sir Ben Kingsley in the UK film, \" Robot Overlords\". In 2013 he was named a 'break out' at The Toronto International Film Festival for his lead role as the French Canadian 'Dominic' in the coming of Age USA Independant film \"Beneath The Harvest Sky\". In 2014 he was named the Winner of a Young Artist Award (USA) for his role as Young Gatsby. He is the youngest winner of the international GQ Man of The Year Award for \"Breakthrough of the Year\" - presented 2012/2013 for his work in the Performing Arts. In tandem to his USA work Callan has also worked in Australia with AACTA Award-winning directors Matt Saville (Cloudstreet) and Robert Connolly (Underground: The Julian Assange story). More recently, as the lead in international film \"Hacker\", he was invited to open the Almaty International Film Festival in Kazakhstan. There he had many adventures, and drank the milk of the camel, and ate the meat of the horse, which imbued him with renewed wit and vigor, respectively. As a younger teen he worked on some of Australia's Logi (Emmy) Award-winning television series including: Packed to Rafters, Comedy Inc, and Blue Water High. He played the lead in Franswa Sharl (Dir Hannah Hilliard) the multi-award winning short film which won The Berlin Crystal Bear at the Berlinale Festival in 2010 along with another nine international awards. Callan is well versed in outdoor survival skills, and can make a mean suspended A-frame. He also maintains that he can start a campfire with nothing but the power of positivity - though is yet to demonstrate this. He is also a natural athlete and can do just about anything you need him to do/are willing to pay him to do. He is a musician and vocalist and plays an unusual number of obscure and sometimes unpleasant instruments to varying levels of competency. These include, but are not limited to the piano, the Chinese violin (erhu/zhongu), the Irish tin flute, the regular violin, the guitar, and the larynx. Callan is good at imitating voices and accents, which can sometimes be offensive but is usually endearing. Callan has studied with The Trinity College (London) in Musical Theatre, The Australia Theatre for Young People, Mr Alan Flower (The Sydney Theatre Company), and has otherwise spent a lot of time learning by watching movies and television to avoid responsibility. Callan is a considerate, charitable fellow, and is the Youth Ambassador to The Wolf Connection in Los Angeles, a charity which focuses on the recovery and well-being of at risk teens, alongside the healing power of rescued wolves. Callan was honoured to be appointed a UNICEF Ambassador in 2013. His mother generally considers him to be well mannered and his father is very proud of him.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NzMwNDM5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTUxNjk0MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2786608","name":"Callan McAuliffe","nicknames":["Callum McAuliffe"],"idIMDB":"nm2786608"},"actorId":"nm2786608","character":"Oburi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0322049","main":true},{"actorName":"Jane Van Der Westhuizen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6955790","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jane Van Der Westhuizen is an actress, known for Kite (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6955790","name":"Jane Van Der Westhuizen","idIMDB":"nm6955790"},"actorId":"nm6955790","character":"Urchin Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Samuel L.

In the eighties, he became well-known after three movies made by Spike Lee: Do the Right Thing (1989), Mo' Better Blues (1990) and Jungle Fever (1991). He achieved prominence and critical acclaim in the early 1990s with films such as Patriot Games (1992), Amos & Andrew (1993), True Romance (1993), Jurassic Park (1993), and his collaborations with director Quentin Tarantino, including Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), and later Django Unchained (2012). Going from supporting player to leading man, his performance in Pulp Fiction (1994) gave him an Oscar nomination for his character Jules Winnfield, and he received a Silver Berlin Bear for his part as Ordell Robbi in Jackie Brown (1997). Jackson usually played bad guys and drug addicts before becoming an action hero, co-starring with Bruce Willis in Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) and Geena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996). With Jackson's permission, his likeness was used for the Ultimate version of the Marvel Comics character, Nick Fury.
