Each lost in their everyday lives, Meira (Hadas Yaron), a Hasidic Jewish wife and mother and Félix (Martin Dubreuil), a Secular loner mourning the recent death of his estranged father, unexpectedly meet in a local bakery in Montreal's Mile End district. What starts as an innocent friendship becomes more serious as the two wayward strangers find comfort in one another. As Félix opens Meira's eyes to the world outside of her tight-knit Orthodox community, her desire for change becomes harder for her to ignore, ultimately forcing her to choose: remain in the life that she knows or give it all up to be with Félix. Giroux's film is a poignant and touching tale of self-discovery set against the backdrops of Montreal, Brooklyn, and Venice, Italy.","simplePlot":"In Félix and Meira, an unusual romance blossoms between two lost souls who inhabit the same neighborhood but vastly different worlds.","actors":[{"actorName":"Martin Dubreuil","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0239575","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA1MzY4MTI1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg5NDYyNTE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"In 2014, the world discovered a new actor by the name of Martin Dubreuil. Co-starring with Hadas Yaron in Maxime Giroux's moving love tale Félix et Meira (2014). As Félix, a forty odd year old dropout, Dubreuil got into his role so well that the viewers all around the world soon had for him... the eyes of Meira! Unknown, Martin Dubreuil? For the rest of the world maybe but not for the people of Quebec (where he was born in 1976) where he is well-known both as an actor and a member of the Breastfeeders band. If you are one of their fans, you cannot not have noticed the eccentric exhibitionist tambourine player and occasional singer: it is Martin Dubreuil hiding under the name of Johnny Malodor. As a film actor (the 16 year old Martin had sworn he would become one after seeing Robert De Niro in Raging Bull (1980)), he has been more than active. He indeed appeared in dozens and dozens of films, even if he did in more shorts than features; but the meaning of it all is that the passionate thespian never says no to a project he deems of interest, whether he is well or underpaid, whether his role is big or small, whether the movie is long or short. During the first six years of his career he even acted exclusively in student movies. But little seen as they were, they did teach him the ropes of his trade. Usually freakish on the big screen, Dubreuil is nearly always violent, aggressive and out of sync. Most of the time you will see him in the guise of a punk, a junkie, a toughie or a brute. And often in works by major Quebec filmmakers such as Pierre Falardeau (Elvis Gratton II: Miracle à Memphis (1999), February 15, 1839 (2001) and Elvis Gratton 3: Le retour d'Elvis Wong (2004)), Eric Tessier (Sur le seuil (2003)), Patrick Huard (The 3 L'il Pigs (2007)) and Yves Christian Fournier (Everything Is Fine (2008)). To say nothing of his six collaborations with Maxime Giroux prior to 'Félix et Meira', the latter movie being an important milestone in Martin Dubreuil filmography inasmuch as it presents a double opportunity for him : its international release brings him wider recognition while on the other hand playing a sweeter character than usual (closer to true colors, by his own admission) showcases the full extent of his talent. Martin Dubreuil, an unknown artist? Nevermore!","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA1MzY4MTI1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg5NDYyNTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0239575","name":"Martin Dubreuil","idIMDB":"nm0239575"},"actorId":"nm0239575","character":"Félix","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hadas Yaron","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2481725","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1ODc1MTc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNzQ1OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 September 1990","placeOfBirth":" Israel","bio":"Hadas Yaron, born in 1990, who portrayed an ultra-orthodox fiance, wife and mother and finally the lover of a Canadian gentile in two films on the run, first in Rama Burshtein's Le coeur a ses raisons (2012), then in Maxime Giroux's Félix et Meira (2014). Her gentle face, her simple and fresh beauty and her innocent eyes make irresistible the two characters she embodies, Shira, an 18-year-old young lady pressured by her family to marry the widowed husband of her older sister in the former film and Meira, the repressed wife (with child) of a Hasidic husband in the latter. But a moving face and figure would not have been enough if Hadas Yaron had not also been an excellent performer. Her having been awarded the 2012 Ophir Award is not a pure question of chance! And as she is only in her mid-twenties, Hadas Yaron can reasonably expect a lot of those rewarding roles her talent deserves.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1ODc1MTc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNzQ1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2481725","name":"Hadas Yaron","idIMDB":"nm2481725"},"actorId":"nm2481725","character":"Meira","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Luzer Twersky","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3872496","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNjIzMDkyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE4NzQ2NTE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 July 1985","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","bio":"Luzer Twersky is an actor who was born in Brooklyn to a Hasidic Jewish family.
