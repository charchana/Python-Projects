He is Bachelors in Marketing & Human Resource Management. He made his film debut in Monsoon Wedding (2001) where he plays NRI (Non Resident Indian). He got the role in Monsoon Wedding primarily because of his Australian accent rather then his acting skills or good looks. However even after a powerful performance in Monsoon Wedding he had to wait for 4 years to get a second project. He finally got lucky and Ramgopal Verma cast him as lead in a gangster flick \"D\" (2005). \"D\" was a turning point in his career and he suddenly became a household name across the country. The \"D\" which supposedly portrays Dawood Ibrahim's real life gave Randeep Hooda a grand entry into tinsel town. Recently he got the lead role in \"Karma, Confessions and Holi\" (2006) produced by Drena De Niro.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk4NjkxNTkxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUwNDA3NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393535","name":"Randeep Hooda","idIMDB":"nm0393535"},"actorId":"nm0393535","character":"Raja Ravi Verma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nandana Sen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0222138","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mzk1Nzk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY2NTcyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 August 1967","placeOfBirth":" Calcutta, West Bengal, India","bio":"Nandana Sen was born on August 19, 1967 in Calcutta, West Bengal, India.

She lost her father when she was only three and was brought up by her mother, noted documentary filmmaker and film historian Vijaya Mulay. She was attracted toward films because of her. In 1965 she was chosen by Pears Soap to be its model. It was this ad film which caught Mrinal Sen's attention and he signed her for Bhuvan Shome (1969). Though Bhuvan Shome proved to be a milestone in Indian cinema, Suhasini did not pursue acting as a career. Instead she enrolled at the prestigious McGill University in Montreal, Canada for a course in agricultural technology with specialization in soil chemistry and microbiology. She also obtained a degree in mass communication, and majored in film, radio, TV, journalism and print from the same university. Suhasini returned to India in 1975 and worked as an assistant to Satyajit Ray in the Bengali film Jana Aranya. Later she joined Mrinal Sen as an assistant director in Mrigaya. Since then, she has been actively producing films and has made over 60 documentaries. She achieved national awards for four of them. Almost 30 years after Bhuvan Shome, she made a great comeback to mainstream Bollywood cinema, through Gulzar's Hu Tu Tu for which she received another national award as the best supporting actress. She has been playing mother roles in Bollywood since then. She has worked on Jaane Kya Baat Hui, a television serial. Currently she completed her latest film PEEDA directed by Hemant Verma. PEEDA recently received best feature film award at FOG film festival USA.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGZkNDYyNGQtMWNhNy00NDYyLTgyODQtZTFlNDdlMzY1OTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611663","name":"Suhasini Mulay","idIMDB":"nm0611663"},"actorId":"nm0611663","character":"Bakubai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Prashant Narayanan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1241910","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFlYjBjY2ItMGIxMi00ZTAzLThhMmEtM2M2NDk0OWViYmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Prashant Narayanan is an actor and assistant director, known for Murder 2 (2011), Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part II (2003) and Shadows of Time (2004).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFlYjBjY2ItMGIxMi00ZTAzLThhMmEtM2M2NDk0OWViYmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1241910","name":"Prashant Narayanan","idIMDB":"nm1241910"},"actorId":"nm1241910","character":"Visakham","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Vipin Sharma","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1479650","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODAyMjcyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI2OTI2MzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Vipin Sharma is an actor and editor, known for Like Stars on Earth (2007), Rainbow (2015) and Gangs of Wasseypur (2012).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODAyMjcyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI2OTI2MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1479650","name":"Vipin Sharma","idIMDB":"nm1479650"},"actorId":"nm1479650","character":"Paachan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shri Vallabh Vyas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0904503","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Shri Vallabh Vyas is an actor, known for Lagaan (2001), Chandni Bar (2001) and Sarfarosh (1999).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0904503","name":"Shri Vallabh Vyas","idIMDB":"nm0904503"},"actorId":"nm0904503","character":"Hirachand","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rashaana Shah","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2298027","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4ODc5MjczN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg5NTU4Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Rashaana Shah is an actress and producer, known for Colours of Passion (2008), Meenaxi: Tale of 3 Cities (2004) and Manjhi: The Mountain Man (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4ODc5MjczN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg5NTU4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2298027","name":"Rashaana Shah","idIMDB":"nm2298027"},"actorId":"nm2298027","character":"Kamini","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0479706","main":true},{"actorName":"Feryna Wazheir","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3092039","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYzYzg3ZDEtNWM4NS00NzAxLWFlZDctZjMxZGZkZTZhMWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ3NDQzNTY@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Feryna Wazheir is an actress, known for Airlift (2016), Secret Heart (2016) and Colours of Passion (2008).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYzYzg3ZDEtNWM4NS00NzAxLWFlZDctZjMxZGZkZTZhMWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ3NDQzNTY@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3092039","name":"Feryna Wazheir","idIMDB":"nm3092039"},"actorId":"nm3092039","character":"Frenny","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rajat Kapoor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0438494","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDBlM2ZiZmEtYzYyMC00ZWNlLTkxMzQtOGFlMzgxZDg5NjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 February 1961","placeOfBirth":" New Delhi, India","bio":"Rajat Kapoor was born on February 11, 1961 in New Delhi, India.
