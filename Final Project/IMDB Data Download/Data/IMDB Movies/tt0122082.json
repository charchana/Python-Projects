He is looking for the singer Nora Luca, whom his father had heard all the time before his death. Wandering along a frozen road, he meets old Izidor, a member of the Roma (Gypsy) and tells him of Nora Luca. Izidor seems to understand and takes him to his village. Stéphane believes that Izidor will take him to Nora Luca when the time has come. So, he lives in the Roma(Gypsy) village for several months. The other inhabitants dislike him at first (as he comes from those who call them thieves and attack their folks) but when they as they get to know him better, they grow to like him. In summer, the ice between him and beautiful Sabina finally cracks, and a secret is revealed.","simplePlot":"A man is looking for a singer he had heard on cassette.

Discovered by a casting director while he was waiting in front of a high school in Paris, he was offered a role. Between popular successes such as \"Good old daze\", \"Dobermann\", \"Tom thumb\", \"The Spanish apartment\" or \"Arsene Lupin\", and independent films like \"17 times Cecile Cassard\", \"Exiles\", \"Gadjo Dilo\", \"Being light\", \"Already dead\" or \"When the cat's away\", Duris proves to be versatile enough to be credible as a bandit, as a homosexual, or simply as a French student in the streets of Barcelona. The consecration has been \"De Battre Mon Coeur S'Est Arrete\"; now Duris is seen as an excellent and touching actor by the critics and by the audience.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NjUwNDA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1NzU1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244151","name":"Romain Duris","idIMDB":"nm0244151"},"actorId":"nm0244151","character":"Stéphane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rona Hartner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0367157","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlhMTk4YzgtMDg0ZC00ZDU3LWI3YTEtYmNlNTJjNGFlNzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UY44_CR36,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 March 1973","placeOfBirth":" Bucharest, Romania","bio":"Rona Hartner was born on March 9, 1973 in Bucharest, Romania.
