His mother, Betsy Franco, is Jewish, and his father, Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, was of Portuguese and Swedish descent, and ran a Silicon Valley business. James's mother, a writer, has occasionally acted. Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Whatever It Takes (2000). Although he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy. Next was Deuces Wild (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean (2001). He was recently seen in David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Nights in Rodanthe (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' In the Valley of Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyOTc0MjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgyODQwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556","name":"James Franco","nicknames":["Ted, Teddy"],"idIMDB":"nm0290556"},"actorId":"nm0290556","character":"Harry Osborn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001353","main":true},{"actorName":"Cliff Robertson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0731772","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2Nzc1MzM0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTA0ODk1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 September 1923","placeOfBirth":" La Jolla [now in San Diego], California, USA","birthName":"Clifford Parker Robertson III","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"A serious and talented actor, at his best playing somewhat troubled characters, Cliff Robertson has been a fairly successful leading man through most of his career without ever becoming a major star. Following strong stage and television experience, he made an interesting film debut in a supporting role in Picnic (1955). He then played Joan Crawford's deranged young husband in Autumn Leaves (1956) and was given leads in films of fair quality such as The Naked and the Dead (1958), Gidget (1959) and The Big Show (1961). He supplemented his somewhat unsatisfactory big-screen work with interesting appearances on television, including the lead male role in the small-screen version of \"Days of Wine and Roses\" in 1958. Robertson could be effective playing a chilling petty criminal obsessed with avenging his father in the B-feature Underworld U.S.A. (1961) or a pleasant doctor in the popular hospital melodrama The Interns (1962). However, significant public notice eluded him until he was picked by President John F. Kennedy to play the young JFK during the latter's World War II experience in PT 109 (1963). Moving into slightly better pictures, Robertson gave some of his best performances: a ruthless presidential candidate in The Best Man (1964), a modern-day Mosca in an updated version of Ben Jonson's \"Volpone\", The Honey Pot (1967), and most memorably as a mentally retarded man in Charly (1968), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. His critical success with \"Charly\" allowed him to continue starring in some good films in the 1970s, including Too Late the Hero (1970), The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid (1972) and Obsession (1976). He also acted in, directed and co-produced the fine rodeo drama J W Coop (1971) and, less interestingly, The Pilot (1980). Since then, he had remained active mostly in supporting roles, notably playing Hugh M. Hefner in Star 80 (1983). More recently, he had supporting parts in Escape from L.A. (1996) and Spider-Man (2002). Cliff Robertson died on September 10, 2011, just one day after his 88th birthday in Stony Brook, New York.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2Nzc1MzM0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTA0ODk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0731772","name":"Cliff Robertson","idIMDB":"nm0731772"},"actorId":"nm0731772","character":"Ben Parker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001368","main":true},{"actorName":"Rosemary Harris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365281","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzOTExOTE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDY0ODk1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1927","placeOfBirth":" Ashby, Suffolk, England, UK","birthName":"Rosemary Ann Harris","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Rosemary Harris was born on September 19, 1927 in Ashby, Suffolk, England as Rosemary Ann Harris.

Though he made his initial mark playing young street toughs on screen, this veteran of the Atlanta stage showed he could use his impressive size for something other than menace with a critically acclaimed performance as Harrison Ford's sympathetic, high-spirited physical therapist in Regarding Henry (1991). Nunn subsequently has played pretty much every type there is, all the way up to nice, huggable teddy bear guys like Whoopi Goldberg's protector Eddie Souther in Sister Act (1992). His professionalism has made him a favorite of other directors besides Lee. He portrayed a Southern police chief in Bill Condon's White Lie (1991) (USA Network), later reteaming with Condon for Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995), and has also acted twice for Michael Apted (Extreme Measures (1996), HBO's Always Outnumbered (1998)) and Gary Fleder (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), Kiss the Girls (1997)). Nunn also turned in a fine performance as Tim Roth's adoptive father in La légende du pianiste sur l'océan (1998), Giuseppe Tornatore's first English-language feature, released initially in Italy and then in the United States in 1999. He can also be seen in Spider-Man (2002), People I Know (2002) with Al Pacino and the prison thriller Lockdown (2000). Nunn has also found time to do numerous television pilots and three series. He was in the CBS series Traps (1994) with George C. Scott, sitcom Local Heroes (1995) for NBC and the critically acclaimed The Job (2001) with Denis Leary on ABC.

The Texas Rangers drafted him in 1985, but he chose instead to attend Louisiana State University on a baseball scholarship. He was the starting center-fielder on the first LSU team to go to the College World Series in 1986, and again in 1987. In 1987, _Everybody's All-American (1988)_ came to shoot in Baton Rouge, and Michael was chosen as Dennis Quaid stunt double for the football scenes. He caught the attention and earned the admiration of Director Taylor Hackford, who encouraged Michael to pursue a career in stunt work. While filming Charlie's Angels (2000), Michael was kicked in the jaw with a stiletto boot. He found himself in an emergency room, insisting that he was not the victim of domestic violence. The spousal abuse representatives had a hard time believing that he had been kicked by Cameron Diaz. Michael is most widely known as \"The Carjacker\" in Spider-Man (2002), whose actions ultimately lead Peter Parker to become Spider-Man. Michael first met director Sam Raimi when he played Kevin Costner's nemesis in For Love of the Game (1999). Another notable role was as Guard Papajohn in The Longest Yard (2005) for producer Adam Sandler. They met when Michael did all of Adam's stunts in The Waterboy (1998), making the hard hits as Bobby Boucher. In The Longest Yard, things came full circle when Michael had his own stuntman. He has produced one film, Rustin (2001), that went on to win festival awards.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDI4ODY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxMTM5NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0660244","name":"Michael Papajohn","nicknames":["Pop"],"idIMDB":"nm0660244"},"actorId":"nm0660244","character":"Carjacker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027404","main":true},{"actorName":"K.K.
