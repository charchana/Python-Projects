Antrim, Northern Ireland, UK","birthName":"William John Neeson","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Liam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, UK, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, truck driver, assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role. Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including The Bounty (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984), The Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1993), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindler's List (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor. Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Taken (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Clash of the Titans (2010) and The A-Team (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown (2011), The Grey (2011), Battleship (2012) and Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel La colère des Titans (2012). Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MTQ3NzU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE3Mjg0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553","name":"Liam Neeson","idIMDB":"nm0000553"},"actorId":"nm0000553","character":"Alfred Kinsey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014772","main":true},{"actorName":"Laura Linney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001473","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMDc3Mzc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc5OTcyMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 February 1964","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Laura Leggett Linney","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Laura Leggett Linney was born in New York City on February 5, 1964, into a theatre family. Her father was prominent playwright Romulus Linney, whose own great-grandfather was a congressman from North Carolina. Her mother, Miriam Anderson (Leggett), is a nurse. Although she did not live in her father's house (her parents having divorced when she was an infant), Linney's world revolved, in part, around his profession from the earliest age. She graduated from Brown University in 1986 and studied acting at Juilliard and the Arts Theatre School in Moscow and, thereafter, embarked on a career on the Broadway stage receiving favorable notices for her work in such plays as \"Hedda Gabler\" and \"Six Degrees of Separation\". Linney's film career began in the early 1990s with small roles in Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and Dave (1993). She landed the role of Mary Anne Singleton in the PBS film adaptations of Armistead Maupin's \"Tales of the City\" series, playing her in Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City (1993), Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City (1998) and Chroniques de San Francisco (2001). Linney's first substantial big-screen role was as the ex-girlfriend of Richard Gere's character in Primal Fear (1996) and her superb performance brought her praise and a better selection of roles. Clint Eastwood chose Linney to play his daughter, another prominent role, in 1997's Absolute Power (1997), followed by another second billing in the following year's The Truman Show (1998). Always a strong performer, Linney truly came into her own after 2000, starting the decade auspiciously with her widely-praised, arguably flawless performance in You Can Count on Me (2000). She found herself nominated for an Academy Award for this, her first lead role, for which her salary had been $10,000. Linney won numerous critics' awards for her role as Sammy, a single mother whose life is complicated by a new boss and the arrival in town of her aimless brother. On the heels of this success came her marvelous turn as Bertha Dorset in The House of Mirth (2000), clearly the best performance in a film of strong performances. Since then, Linney has frequently been offered challenging dramatic roles, and always rises to the occasion, such as in Mystic River (2003), in which she worked again with Clint Eastwood, and Kinsey (2004), for which she received another Academy Award nomination.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMDc3Mzc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc5OTcyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001473","name":"Laura Linney","idIMDB":"nm0001473"},"actorId":"nm0001473","character":"Clara McMillen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014773","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris O'Donnell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000563","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTY1OTIzMDIzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYyNjY0MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 June 1970","placeOfBirth":" Winnetka, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Christopher Eugene O'Donnell","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Christopher Eugene O'Donnell was born on June 26th, 1970 in Winnetka, Illinois, to Julie Ann (Rohs) and William Charles O'Donnell, Sr., who managed a CBS radio station, WBBM-AM.

Peter then started gracing the art-house circuit, making a violent, searing impression as a homophobic killer in Boys Don't Cry (1999) starring two-time Oscar-winner Hilary Swank as a trans-gendered teen. Other impressionable offbeat roles for Peter that have thrilled critics from coast to coast include Shattered Glass (2003), which earned him a slew of awards including the prestigious National Society of Film Critics Award.

He was born in Rochester, New York, to Sarah Jane (Price), an actress, and Arthur Washington Lithgow III, who was both a theatrical producer and director. John's father was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, where the Anglo-American Lithgow family had lived for several generations. John moved frequently as a child, while his father founded and managed local and college theaters and Shakespeare festivals throughout the Midwest of the United States. Not until he was 16, and his father became head of the McCarter Theater in Princeton New Jersey, did the family settle down. But for John, the theater was still not a career. He won a scholarship to Harvard University, where he finally caught the acting bug (as well as found a wife). Harvard was followed by a Fulbright scholarship to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Returning from London, his rigorous dramatic training stood him in good stead, and a distinguished career on Broadway gave him one Tony Award for \"The Changing Room\", a second nomination in 1985 for \"Requiem For a Heavyweight\", and a third in 1988 for \"M. Butterfly\". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion, and in the mid 1970s, he and his wife divorced. He entered therapy, and in 1982, his life started in a new direction, the movies - he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp (1982). A second Oscar nomination followed for Terms of Endearment (1983), and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife. As the decade of the 1990s came around, he found that he was spending too much time on location, and another career move brought him to television in the hugely successful series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996). This production also played a role in bringing him back together with the son from his first marriage, Ian Lithgow, who has a regular role in the series as a dimwitted student.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMzUyNDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMwNTU5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001475","name":"John Lithgow","nicknames":["Jiggles"],"idIMDB":"nm0001475"},"actorId":"nm0001475","character":"Alfred Seguine Kinsey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0195679","main":true},{"actorName":"Tim Curry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000347","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTQ2OTYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEzMTA1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 April 1946","placeOfBirth":" Grappenhall, Cheshire, England, UK","birthName":"Timothy James Curry","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Timothy James Curry was born on April 19, 1946 in Grappenhall, Cheshire, England.

In her early career, Veronica was cast in a number of popular movies such as The Children's Hour (1961), Spencer's Mountain (1963) and Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963). As such, she was cast as \"Jemima Boone\" in the popular television series Daniel Boone (1964), which ran from 1964 to 66. Her career after \"Daniel Boone\" may have been influenced by Hitchcock, since she appeared in both the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and the horror classic Alien (1979). On television, she appeared twice as Lumpy's younger sister, \"Violet Rutherford\" and once as \"Peggy MacIntosh\" on Leave It to Beaver (1957) and had a small role in the television movie Still the Beaver (1983). Cartwright also appeared in Robert Kennedy and His Times (1985), Tanner '88 (1988) and had a recurring role on L.A. Law (1986). Her big screen features included The Right Stuff (1983), Flight of the Navigator (1986) and The Witches of Eastwick (1987). Veronica worked on the stage in \"Electra\", \"Talley's Folly\", \"Homesteaders\", \"Butterflies are Free\" and \"The Triplet Connection\". Alternating between television and big screen movies in the 90s, Cartwright has appeared in such films as Hitler's Daughter (1990) and Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NDE0MDkyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI1MzUyMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001021","name":"Veronica Cartwright","idIMDB":"nm0001021"},"actorId":"nm0001021","character":"Sara Kinsey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kathleen Chalfant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0149910","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNjg3NzY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxNDgzMg@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 January 1945","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"Kathleen Ann Bishop","bio":"Kathleen Chalfant was born on January 14, 1945 in San Francisco, California, USA as Kathleen Ann Bishop.
