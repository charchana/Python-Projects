In addition to this, after he had his first appearance on stage in drama class, his passion for acting became more and more obvious. After working with disabled children for 11 months and high-school diploma, his acting studies at the prestigious \"High School for Music and Performing Arts\" in Stuttgart began. For about two years, followed-up on this he took over several parts on stage until his leading part in the television series \"Wege zum Glück\" turned out to be a mainstream success, which in addition enhanced his awareness at a larger audience. Subsequently he assumed a part in the prime-time Event-Movie \"Sea of Death\" as leading actor. From that point on he played numerous roles in German feature films and series. But also, again and again he was drawn to the stage, which is, in his own words, the origin of the profession. Hugo loves to dance. Given the fact that he's an avid fan of Michael Jackson, very early he started copying his dance moves. Hugo Grimm is a father of two. He and his family are living in Berlin.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI5YzM3ZmMtNjcyMS00OGNkLWJiNTktNzk3N2I4MzJiYjc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDMzNDM3NzM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2440239","name":"Hugo Grimm","idIMDB":"nm2440239"},"actorId":"nm2440239","character":"Thomas Oakwood","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Claudia Hübschmann","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2144637","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 April 1974","placeOfBirth":" Potsdam, German Democratic Republic","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Claudia Hübschmann was born on April 6, 1974 in Potsdam, German Democratic Republic.
