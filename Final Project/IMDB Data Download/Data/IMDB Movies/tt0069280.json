Primarily, he is moving between three general time periods and locations. The first is his stint as a GI during WWII, when, as a pacifist, he was acting as a Chaplain's assistant for his unit. This time is largely as a POW, where he was in Dresden the day of the bombing, spending it with among others an older compassionate GI named Edgar Derby, and a brash loudmouth GI named Paul Lazzaro. The second is his life as an optometrist in Ilium in upstate New York, eventually married to the wealthy and overbearing Valencia Merble, and having two offspring, Robert, who would spend his teen-aged years as a semi-delinquent, and Barbara, who would end up much like her mother.

Born in Depression-era Boston the son of a Navy man, the moon-faced, intent-looking Roche started on radio at age 15 displaying his knack for character voices, both men and women. He enlisted in the U.S. Army following high school, then studied at Emerson College. Searching for work in summer stock and variety shows, he appeared in productions of \"Pal Joey\" with Bob Fosse and \"Point of No Return\" with Henry Fonda. Newly married at this time, he found classical stage parts to play in early 50s San Francisco, then headed for New York and began appearing in dramatic TV shows and commercials. He made his Broadway debut with \"Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole\" starring Darren McGavin and went on to do \"The White House\" with Helen Hayes and \"Mother Courage\" with Anne Bancroft. Comedy became his forte on TV with showy recurring roles on Soap (1977),Night Court (1984), and Perfect Strangers (1986), while choice support parts came his way on film, including The Late Show (1977) and Foul Play (1978) -- some roles cantankerous, some lovable, some menacing. The father of nine children, three of his male offspring have opted for entertainment careers: Eamonn Roche and Brogan Roche are actors, and Sean Roche is an Emmy award-winning writer and producer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwOTgzMjg0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA4NTgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0733929","name":"Eugene Roche","idIMDB":"nm0733929"},"actorId":"nm0733929","character":"Edgar Derby","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sharon Gans","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304535","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 July 1942","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"Sharon Gans was born on July 29, 1942 in New York City, New York, USA.

Friedrich was the younger brother of renowned Viennese stage and film actor and director Leopold von Ledebur, both descended from a distinguished aristocratic family (their forebears included several high-ranking luminaries among the clergy, as well as political and military leaders). As a cavalry officer in an Ulan (Light Cavalry) Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army, he saw action during the First World War. Friedrich was a superb rider, a skill which later stood him in good stead as a trainer of horses for the film industry. After the war, having gained an engineering diploma (which he rarely, if ever, put to use), he spent the next two decades travelling the world, working all manner of odd jobs from gold mining to deep sea diving, to riding and winning prize money at rodeos. Having finally settled down in the United States in 1939, he eventually anglicised his name to 'Frederick'. A close friendship with a fellow adventurer, the director John Huston, paved the way for more substantial character roles in Hollywood. The first and best of these was as the laconic cannibal Queeqeg, chief harpooneer on the ship \"Pequod\" in Huston's Moby Dick (1956). This is unquestionably the role for which he is best remembered. Friedrich came to specialise in eccentric character roles, ranging from stoic Indian chiefs to Vikings, from German Field Marshals to imposing Pirate Captains and Spanish aristocrats. Latterly white-maned, he popped up in a wide variety of genres, from historical epics, to spy thrillers and European westerns, even as one of the monastic guardians of the devil in the \"The Howling Man\" episode of The Twilight Zone (1959). The actor was first married to English actress, poet and noted wit Iris Tree. His second wife (from 1955) was the Countess Alice Hoyos, who was descended from a titled Spanish dynasty, latterly resident in Austria.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496428","name":"Friedrich von Ledebur","idIMDB":"nm0496428"},"actorId":"nm0496428","character":"German Leader","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ekkehardt Belle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068798","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 May 1954","placeOfBirth":" Glehn, Grevenbroich, Germany","bio":"Ekkehardt Belle was born on May 18, 1954 in Glehn, Grevenbroich, Germany.

Born in 1924 in New Haven, Connecticutt, Blossom graduated from the prestigious Asheville School in 1941 and attended Harvard. Roberts initially planned on being a therapist, but eventually changed his mind and decided to become an actor instead. He made his film debut in the bizarre and little seen independent feature \"The Sin of Jesus\" (1961). It wasn't until he was in his late forties and early fifties that Blossom really hit his stride acting in motion pictures. Roberts gave a truly remarkable and unforgettable performance as demented middle-aged backwoods lunatic Ezra Cobb in the creepy horror cult favorite \"Deranged\" (1974). Other memorable film roles include an ill-fated elderly patient in \"The Hospital\" (1971), a sickly soldier in \"Slaughterhouse Five\" (1972), Paul Le Mat's ornery father in \"Citizen's Band\" (1977), a farmer who saw Bigfoot once in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977), a venerable old felon in \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), a kindly next door neighbor in \"Home Alone\" (1990), and a grumpy small town judge in \"Doc Hollywood\" (1991). Blossom did guest spots on such TV shows as \"Northern Exposure,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"The Equalizer,\" \"Moonlighting,\" \"Amazing Stories,\" and \"Naked City.\" Moreover, Blossom was also a poet (he released some of his dramatic poems on video) and a playwright who won four Obies and a Show Business Award. After retiring from acting, Roberts settled in Berkeley, California and wrote poetry. He died at age 87 in Santa Monica, California on July 8, 2011.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMDkwNTkwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIxMzYwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089348","name":"Roberts Blossom","idIMDB":"nm0089348"},"actorId":"nm0089348","character":"Wild Bob Cody","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Dehner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0215000","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyNzI3NDkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU2MzYwOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 November 1915","placeOfBirth":" Richmond [now Staten Island], New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"John Dehner Forkum","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Unlike many actors, John Dehner's career didn't begin on the stage or on radio.
