He is the son of Helen Veronica (Wall), a secretary, and Francis Richard Moore, who worked on an auto assembly line. He has Irish, as well as English and Scottish, ancestry. Moore studied journalism at the University of Michigan-Flint, and also pursued other hobbies such as gun shooting, for which he even won a competition. Michael began his journalistic career writing for the school newspaper \"The Michigan Times,\" and after dropping out of college briefly worked as editor for \"Mother Jones.\" He then turned to filmmaking, and to earn the money for the budget of his first film Roger & Me (1989) he ran neighborhood bingo games. The success of this film launched his career as one of America's best-known and most controversial documentarians. He has produced a string of documentary films and TV series predominantly about the same subject: attacks on corrupt politicians and greedy business corporations. He landed his first big hit with Bowling for Columbine (2002) about the bad points of the right to bear arms in America, which earned him an Oscar and a big reputation. He then shook the world with his even bigger hit Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), making fun of President George W. Bush. This is the highest-grossing documentary of all time. Michael is known for having the guts to give his opinion in public, which not many people are courageous enough to do, and for that is respected by many.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMDEwNjk1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI4NDA2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601619","name":"Michael Moore","nicknames":["The Big Man"],"idIMDB":"nm0601619"},"actorId":"nm0601619","character":"Himself - Narrator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Salvador Allende","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0021201","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjA3MjI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1MDE1MjE@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 June 1908","placeOfBirth":" Valparaíso City, Valparaíso, V Region, Chile","birthName":"Salvador Allende Gossens","bio":"Allende became the Socialist President of Chile--elected by popular vote--in 1970 who was replaced by the now notorious Augusto Pinochet. It has been reported that Allende committed suicide. But it has not been determined whether his death was the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or by fire caused by invading troops in the military coup designed to oust him from office. In retrospect, many believe that his eventual downfall was the result of conflicts between the Chilean political Left and Right. Chile's Left drew its support from the urban poor and working class. The Right was supported by a cohesive upper class that was able to galvanize its resources from agrarian and industrial interests. Additionally, the Right was able to persuade the middle class to join its ranks. The threat of Allende's Socialist policies inevitably left his administration vulnerable to the assault of a much larger and better financed political Right. Moreover, his administration had to endure the hostility of the United States during the Cold War era that saw his rise to power as a \"Socialist\" threat to American Democracy and capitalism. Many records confirm that the United States subsidized anti-Allende strikes and vowed its support of the military which was virulently against his administration. Unfortunately, Chile inherited Pinochet as a military dictator in 1973; at present Pinochet has been charged with war crimes for atrocities committed against opponents of his totalitarian regime. Allende's brief three years as President of Chile, beginning in 1970, are seen by his supporters and admirers as one man's efforts to neutralize the tyranny and economic hegemony of the upper classes and elites. His detractors view him as a man who threatened the Chilean economy with Socialist economic policy. His administration and his death will inevitably continue to be discussed and debated for years to come. It should be noted that many members of Allende's family were necessarily forced to leave Chile, but have nevertheless done quite well for themselves; the most notable and visible of his survivors is critically and popularly acclaimed author Isabel Allende, his niece.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NjA3MjI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1MDE1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0021201","name":"Salvador Allende","idIMDB":"nm0021201"},"actorId":"nm0021201","character":"Himself - President of Chile","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacobo Arbenz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0033359","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 September 1913","placeOfBirth":" Quezaltenango, Guatemala","birthName":"Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán","bio":"Jacobo Arbenz was born on September 14, 1913 in Quezaltenango, Guatemala as Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.

Bush, the 43rd president of the U.S., who is known as \"Bush 43\"), was born on June 12, 1924 in Milton, Massachusetts, a suburb south of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (Walker) and Prescott Bush, who was then the president of sales for the Stedman Products Co. of South Braintree, Massachusetts. In 1925, Prescott joined the United States Rubber Co. (New York, NY) as their foreign division manager, necessitating a move to Greenwich, Connecticut. Prescott Bush (Yale 1917) made his fortune and name as an investment banker on Wall St., eventually becoming a partner of the white shoe brokerage Brown Bros. Harriman. He was a member of the Yale Corp., the principal governing body of Yale University, from 1944 to 1956 and was on the board of directors of the Columbia Broadcasting System (C.B.S.), after having been introduced to C.B.S. Chairman William Paley in 1932 by his friend and business partner Averell Harriman, a major Democratic party power-broker. George Bush was educated at the exclusive Greenwich Country Day School in Greenwich, Connecticut before moving on to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he matriculated from 1936 to 1942. At Phillips Andover, he captained the baseball and soccer teams and was a member of an exclusive fraternity called the A.U.V, or \"Auctoritas, Unitas, Veritas\", Latin for \"Authority, Unity, Truth\". Like his father before him, Bush was on schedule to attend Yale College and would have in the fall of 1942, but for the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941 that necessitated the entry of the United States into World War II. Upon his graduation from Phillips Andover, George Bush enlisted in the U.S. Navy on June 12, 1942, his 18th birthday, with the intent on becoming an aviator. After completing the 10-month naval aviation course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve three days before his nineteenth birthday, which made him the youngest naval aviator ever at the time. George Bush married the former Barbara Pierce on January 6, 1945, and after he was demobilized, they moved to New Haven, Connecticut so that he could attend Yale, where he proved a fine student and captained the baseball team, which made it to the first College World Series. They had their first of six children, future President George Walker Bush, two days after the Fourth of July, 1946. In his senior year, George Bush was tapped for the exclusive secret society Skull & Bones, as had been his father (and as his son would be). Using his father's connections and $2 million in seed money from his relatives (approximately $17 million in 2006 terms), George Bush prospered in the oil industry after graduating from Yale in 1949. Through his father's business and social relationship with a fellow Skull & Bones member, George Bush secured a position with Dresser Industries, on whose board of directors Prescott had served for 22 years. As the son of a moderate Republican senator, it was natural that George Bush would stand for office. At the time, the \"Solid South\" was solidly Democratic, with the Republican Party of Civil War winner (and Civil Rights champion) Abraham Lincoln anathema below the Mason-Dixon line. Good Republican candidates were hard to come by (though John Tower later proved that a Republican could win in the Deep South when he took a Senate seat in 1966). One year after his father left the Seante, his son George stood won the Republican nomination to oppose Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, an ally of President 'Lyndon Johnson (I)' (QB), who was on his way to defeating Republican Presidential nominee Barry Goldwater in an electoral landslide in 1964. Riding the coat-tails of favorite son Johnson, Yarborough handily won reelection, keeping George Bush in the private sector for two more years. Bush stood for a House seat in 1966 and won, then won reelection in 1968. In Congress, he established a reputation as a liberal Republican and was known as a supporter of contraception services (his father, Prescott, had been a mainstay of Planned Parenthood). At the request of President Richard Nixon, Bush gave up his seat voluntarily in 1970 to seek the Senate seat of Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough, who was a fierce Nixon critic. It was felt that Yaborough's liberalism made him vulnerable to a challenge from the right, and it did; however, it was the right-wing of the Democratic Party. Lloyd Bentsen won the Democratic nomination and, endorsed by Yarborough, beat Bush handily in the November general election. (Ironically, Bentsen would one day be the running mate of Bush's 1988 rival for the presidency, Michael Dukakis.) One of the reason for Bush's defeat was that with Yarborough out of the race, Nixon's support for Bush's campaign was only half-hearted. As a payback to Bush, Nixon appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations, and he later served Nixon as the Chairman of the Republican National Committee during the Watergate crisis. Nixon's successor in the Oval Office, Gerald Ford, briefly considered appointing Bush as his replacement as vice president before going with liberal Republican stalwart Nelson Rockefeller, the four-term governor of the State of New York, but Ford eventually appointed Bush as the first American plenipotentiary to Communist China, then later director of the Central Intelligence Agency. After losing the 1980 Republican nomination to Ronald Reagan, Bush was chosen as Reagan's running mate and elected Vice President of the United States in Reagan's victory over incumbent President Jimmy Carter in November. In 1988, Bush as vice president was Reagan's heir apparent, and he won the Republican nomination handily, though personally he was not very popular. Bush was perceived as \"weak\" due to his social liberalism, which included support for abortion rights and contraception. As a \"Rockefeller Republican\" (that is, an Eastern Establishment pro-business Republican who is moderate or liberal on social issues), Bush was out-of-step in an increasingly conservative party dominated by voters from the South and West. Unlike Reagan, the well-educated, thoughtful Bush, who according to Reagan biographer Edmund Morris was a genuinely nice and gracious person, and more importantly: sincere. However, Bush was perceived as not standing for anything, at least not in the stark black & white terms that had inspired the conservative if not reactionary Republican Party faithful during the two terms of the \"Great Communicator\". As president, Bush saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, and he soared to unprecedented levels of public approval after his firm handling of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait pushed the Iraqi army out of the invaded kingdom with a minimum amount of U.S. casualties. However, his popularity plummeted by the time the campaign rolled around in 1992 due to his seeming inability to cope with a recession caused by economic dislocations linked to the end of the Cold War. After the presidency, George Bush prospered financially as a corporate speaker, reportedly making as much as $10 million from the Reverend Sun Myung Moon. Bush's business ventures through the Carlyle Group, a private equity fund with close ties to the government of Saudi Arabia, have proved very remunerative. Most importantly, he achieved personal vindication when his son, George Walker Bush, defeated Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States. Now in the twilight of his years, comfortably retired from the political wars, Bush has teamed with fellow ex-President Bill Clinton in a uniquely close relationship in which the two have jointly led campaigns to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 devastation of the Gulf Coast by Hurricane Katrina via private sector fund-raising.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2Mjk4NzQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMwMDM5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124132","name":"George Bush","nicknames":["The Résumé Candidate","Poppy","The Wimp","41","Senior"],"idIMDB":"nm0124132"},"actorId":"nm0124132","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"George W.

His mother was Barbara Bush (the former Barbara Pierce), whom his father had married on January 6, 1945. \"W\" was their first child named after his father. Bush disliked being called \"Junior\" or Bush II, or even having the term \"Jr.\" abbreviated next to his name. Initially, W's prospects of living up to his illustrious pedigree were dim. Possibly hobbled by dyslexia (a condition little understood and seldom treated during his childhood), Bush proved an uninspired student in high school. He did maintain a gentlemanly \"C+\" average at Yale and acquired a Masters of Business Administration degree from Harvard Business School, but until he turned 40, he seemed to be floundering. He admittedly had a drinking problem in his youth, but a late marriage to Laura Welch helped stabilize him. His rebirth as a believing Christian (he is a Methodist whereas his parents were Episcopalian) in 1986 helped put him on the straight and narrow path that led him to the Presidency. Bush has been discounted many times in his life and career for being wooden and unintelligent due to his fractured speaking style, but in fact, his academic performance was on par if not slightly better than that of his better-spoken, fellow Yalie John Kerry. As Bush's test scores and subsequent achievements suggest an above average intelligence, it is appropriate to believe that he likely has benefited from other's underestimation of his gifts. This was apparent in the first televised debate with Al Gore in 2000, when Bush held his own against the condescending vice president, and in doing so, triumphed in the eyes of the political handicappers. After W. turned his life around in the late 1980s, he began achieving success on his own, though that success inevitably was indebted to his social position and his father's business and political connections, particularly after he himself ascended to the Presidency after the expiration of Ronald Reagan's second term. The first President Bush (Bush 41, as he is colloquially known) had great connections in the Middle East, particularly with the Saudi royal family and the powerful Bin Laden clan. Using his father's Saudi connections, Bush Jr. became a millionaire twice over through Middle Eastern oil projects. His most notable achievement in private life was in becoming president and chief operating partner of the Texas Rangers professional baseball team, which was financially invigorated by the building of a new stadium with taxpayers' funds. For a man whose greatest ambition was not the presidency but to be baseball commissioner, the \"job\" of Rangers owner suited him just fine, and his stint as the amiable owner of the team helped generate good publicity that wiped out his past image as a playboy. When he cashed out his ownership stake, Bush had a $14 million profit. More importantly, ownership of the Rangers positioned him financially and in the public eye for a successful run for the governorship of Texas, which proved to be his springboard to the presidency. Under the quirky Texas constitution, the governor of Texas is primarily a ceremonial position, somewhat akin to that of the president in a Parliamentary system. The true political power in Texas lies with the lieutenant governor, who acts as a prime minister (or provincial premier in Canada) in that that he/she runs the legislature. In a life characterized by luck, the capricious Bush was luckier still in that he was told by the lieutenant governor, a Democrat, that he would make Bush a great governor if he would let him. Bush did and established an enviable reputation, one that crossed both party lines in Texas, where it would have been futile for the governor to act in a partisan fashion. With his father's Eastern Establishment credentials that linked him to the \"Rockefeller Republicans\" (conservative on financial matters, liberal on social issues) and his mother's own noted social liberalism, Bush was seen as being a moderate with a difference. That difference was his connections to the powerful evangelical Christian wing of the Republican Party, due to his own rebirth as a believing Christian and his immersion in day-to-day Texas politics. In the Sun Belt, fundamentalists and evangelicals were considered ordinary, run-of-the-day folk, not the exotics that Washington and the Eastern Establishment looked at them as. With a foot in both wings of the party, Bush was seen as a natural candidate for president after Bob Dole's dolorous 1996 candidacy. That he was a \"straight shooter\" with no scandal attached to him since his misbegotten youth (which he had confessed to and had put behind him) made him attractive to the Republicans, who had tried to terminate William Jefferson Clinton's presidency through impeachment due to his lies linked to his \"bimbo eruptions.\" Bush seemed like a \"Man for All Seasons\" that would be the GOP's best shot of unseating the Clintonistas as represented by Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. With the Republican Establishment firmly behind him as a kind of \"Great White Hope\" of the Grand Old Party, Bush managed to wrap up the nomination easily, after stumbling initially when confronted with the candidacy of the renegade Republican senator from Arizona, John McCain. Although viewed by most Republicans as a RINO (Republican in name only), McCain dominated the early primaries in states that allowed cross over voting by attracting middle-of-the-road independents and conservative Democrats, but stumbled himself when the primary season headed South. He was badly defeated by Bush in South Carolina, a deeply conservative state that had voted for favorite son (and segregationist) Strom Thurmond in 1948, uber-conservative Barry Goldwater in 1964, and segregationist George Wallace in 1968. McCain also was victimized by smear tactics, such as the whispering campaign started by Mississippi Senator Trent Lott that claimed the renegade McCain had been mentally discombobulated by his seven years as a POW in Vietnam. The dirty tricks used against McCain by Bush campaign manager/major domo Karl Rove would prove to be harbingers of the paranoid style of politics that would come to fruition during Bush's first term.) McCain, a maverick senator with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a following among conservative Democrats, was not only smeared, but his attempts to get on the ballot in such states as New York were stymied until the federal courts stepped in. (In 2004, even though he endorsed Bush against Kerry, McCain found himself smeared again by elements connected with Karl Rove when he defended Kerry's war record and patriotism.) The Republican Establishment were determined to give the nomination to a true blue Republican who could win (the color red was not associated with the GOP until Election Night 2000, when it was used as the map color for the Party after a century wherein the Republicans were blue and the Democrats red). After his defeat of McCain in South Carolina, Bush had as easy a time wrapping up the nomination as if he had been an incumbent. At the beginning of the fall campaign, what with the U.S. still enjoying the tail end of almost eight years of prosperity under President Bill Clinton, his vice president, Al Gore, started out as a prohibitive favorite to win the presidency. Gore, whoever, turned out to be unable to shed his past reputation as an uninspiring campaigner, and failed to fire up the uncommitted. Bush, on the other hand, a relative unknown commodity who had enjoyed good press for the past decade as a baseball owner and governor, did not make many errors after appearing at Bob Jones University several weeks after it had banned interracial dating during the early Republican primaries (for which he apologized). He capitalized on the low expectations others had for him, and won respect - and votes - for going the distance without stumbling or embarrassing himself, while Gore had to live down the bimbo eruptions of his past running mate and his own faux pas, such as his claim to have invented the \"Information Superhighway\" (Internet). His stiff, \"Wooden Indian\" style came off as pompous on the campaign trail, giving Bush's persona a boost as it could have been portrayed as bumbling if he had been up against a natural born campaigner such as Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan. In the game of politics as played in the US, Gore had everything to lose and Bush had everything to gain. Gore had to rise and exceed expectations while Bush merely had to live up to lowered expectations to rise above them and gain credence, and he did, beginning with the first debate. Going into the first debate, pundits expected the better-spoken Gore to eviscerate the syntactically challenged Bush (whose intelligence they disparaged), but it did not happen. Gore was haughty, and since Bush held his own, the governor of Texas was adjudged the winner. From there to the end of the campaign, Gore could never consolidate his early lead, which slipped away. On election day, Bush and Gore were locked in a dead heat. In the closest election in a century, it all came down to a matter of 537 votes in Florida. Out of the nearly six million votes cast in the Sunshine State (5,861,785 total, only 36,742 of which were won by third party candidates), Bush won by a margin representing 0.0087%. That's less than nine one-thousandths of a percentage point. After a long drawn-out process involving recounts and court challenges, Bush took the oath of office on January 20, 2001 and won re-election in November 2004 to become the first son of a president to win two terms in office.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTk5MjQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk2NDAzOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124133","name":"George W.

He had one older brother, Bradley, who was killed in World War II. At the age of 16, Clark got his first job in the mailroom of WRUN, a radio station in Utica, New York, which was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. He worked his way up the ranks and was promoted to weatherman before becoming a radio announcer. After graduating from Syracuse University with a degree in business administration, Clark began working at several radio and television stations before landing at WFIL radio in 1952. While working at the station, Clark became a substitute host for Bob Horn's Bandstand, an afternoon program where teenagers danced to popular music, broadcast by WFIL's affiliated television station. In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving, giving Clark the perfect opportunity to step in as the full-time host. After acquiring nationwide distribution the newly reformatted program, now titled \"American Bandstand\", premiered on ABC on August 5, 1957. In addition to the name change, Clark added interviews with artists (starting with Elvis Presley), lip-sync performances, and \"Rate-a-Record,\" allowing teens to judge the songs on the show - and giving birth to the popular phrase, \"It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.\" Clark also established a formal dress code, mandating dresses and skirts for the women and a coat and tie for the men. But perhaps the most impactful change that Clark made to the show was ending \"American Bandstand's\" all-white policy, allowing African American artists to perform on the show. Under Clark's influence, \"Bandstand\" became one of the most successful and longest-running musical programs, featuring artists including Chuck Berry, the Doors, the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and Smokey Robinson. Sonny and Cher, The Jackson 5, Prince, and Aerosmith were among the influential artists and bands that made their television debuts on \"Bandstand\", which is also credited with helping to make America more accepting of rock 'n' roll. With the success of \"American Bandstand\", Clark became more invested in the music publishing and recording businesses, and began managing artists, hosting live sock hops, and arranging concert tours. But in 1960, when the United States Senate began investigating \"payola\", the practice in which music producing companies paid broadcasting companies to favor their products, Clark became caught up in the scandal. The investigation found he had partial copyrights to over 150 songs, many of which were featured on his show. Clark denied he was involved in any way, but admitted to accepting a fur and jewelry from a record company president. In the end, the Senate could not find any illegal actions by Clark, but ABC asked Clark to either sell his shares in these companies or leave the network so there was no conflict of interest. He chose to sell and continue on as host of \"American Bandstand\", which was unaffected by the scandal. In 1964, Clark moved Bandstand from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and became more involved in television production. Under his company Dick Clark Productions, he produced such shows as \"Where the Action Is\", \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes\", and more recently, \"So You Think You Can Dance\", as well as made-for-television movies including \"Elvis\", \"The Birth of the Beatles\", \"Wild Streets\", and \"The Savage Seven\". Clark also hosted television's \"$10,000 Pyramid\", \"TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes\" (with co-host Ed McMahon), \"Scattergories\", and \"The Other Half\". Clark also had several radio programs, including \"The Dick Clark National Music Survey\", \"Countdown America\", and \"Rock, Roll & Remember\". In 1972, he produced and hosted the very first edition of \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\", a musical program where Clark counted down until the New Year ball dropped in Times Square, featuring taped performances from musical artists. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" soon became a cultural tradition, airing on ABC every year with Clark as host (except in 1999 when ABC aired \"ABC 2000: Today\", a news milestone program hosted by Peter Jennings). In December 2004, Clark suffered a minor stroke and was unable to host, so Regis Philbin stepped in as a substitute. The following year, Clark returned as co-host alongside primary host Ryan Seacrest. Many were worried about Clark due to his slurred and breathless speech, and he admitted on-air he was still recovering but that he wouldn't have missed the broadcast for the world. The following year, Seacrest became \"New Year's Rockin' Eve's\" primary host, but Clark always returned for the countdown. Clark has received several notable awards including four Emmy Awards, the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Peabody Award in 1999. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1976, The Radio Hall of Fame in 1990, Broadcasting Magazine Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame. Clark had been in St. John's hospital in Los Angeles after undergoing an outpatient procedure the night of April 17, 2012. Clark suffered a massive heart attack following the procedure. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he died the next morning of April 18, 2012.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NDI4NTYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA5ODAyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163863","name":"Dick Clark","nicknames":["The World's Oldest Teenager"],"idIMDB":"nm0163863"},"actorId":"nm0163863","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bill Clinton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001051","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYwMjc3ODEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTI1NDM1._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 August 1946","placeOfBirth":" Hope, Arkansas, USA","birthName":"William Jefferson Blythe III","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III in Hope, Arkansas, to Virginia Dell (Cassidy) and William Jefferson Blythe, Jr., a traveling salesman.

In 1950, his mother married Roger Clinton, whose surname young Bill took; his half-brother, Roger Clinton, was born in 1956. Always interested in politics and working to help people, Clinton majored in International Affairs at Georgetown University. He graduated in 1968 and won a Rhodes Scholarship, which he used to study government at Oxford University. Clinton graduated from Yale Law School in 1973. He then taught law in Arkansas, and ran for political office. He was elected Arkansas Attorney General in 1976, then Governor in 1978.
