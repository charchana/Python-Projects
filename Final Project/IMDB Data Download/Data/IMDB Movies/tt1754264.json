This song was praised by the three judges, and they unanimously sent him through to the Top 100. Geyer was the first contestant who was \"officially\" accepted by \"Idol\" into the top 100. Likewise, due to the rules changing on \"Idol\", Geyer was allowed to accompany himself on guitar.

He was born in Evansville, Indiana on December 6, 1985, spending his formative years in Raleigh, Illinois. At age 16, Todd had moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he joined a boxing gym and thus started training. His learning experience about the MMA was enhanced with viewings of old Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fights he rented. Not long after this, Todd began training at a MMA gym. Upon entering the MMA circuit, Todd found success against several fighters and earned a notable triumph over UFC and PRIDE FC veteran fighter Assuiero Silva with a knockout victory during their second round together. He graduated to fighting in the UFC, scheduled to make his debut showing at UFC #99, held on June of 2009 until the UFC withdrew him to insert another fighter. This revision of scheduled fights happened once more until Todd was at last matched against Tim Hague at UFC #102 held on August 2009 in Portland, Oregon. This match was an impressive victory for the boxing-based fighter as he scored a record-setting fast knockout against Hague. At UFC #114, he was matched against Mike Russow, a fellow newcomer in a bout that ended in an upset defeat for Todd by way of a knockout during their third round. As time continued while in the UFC, a series of injuries often time led to Todd Duffee being replaced with other fighters, thus he did not fight much. Eventually in 2010, on September 7, Todd was released from the UFC. Afterwards, he began fighting in other, smaller fighting leagues. Outside of the fighting spectrum, Todd Duffee trains at the Colorado-based facility Grudge Training Center.
