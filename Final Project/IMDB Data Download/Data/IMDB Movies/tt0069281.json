Laurence Kerr Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, England, to Agnes Louise (Crookenden) and Gerard Kerr Olivier, a High Anglican priest. His surname came from a great-great-grandfather who was of French Huguenot origin. One of Olivier's earliest successes as a Shakespearean actor on the London stage came in 1935 when he played \"Romeo\" and \"Mercutio\" in alternate performances of \"Romeo and Juliet\" with John Gielgud. A young Englishwoman just beginning her career on the stage fell in love with Olivier's Romeo. In 1937, she was \"Ophelia\" to his \"Hamlet\" in a special performance at Kronberg Castle, Elsinore, Denmark. In 1940, she became his second wife after both returned from making films in America that were major box office hits of 1939. His film was Wuthering Heights (1939), her film was Gone with the Wind (1939). Vivien Leigh and Olivier were screen lovers in Fire Over England (1937), 21 Days Together (1940) and That Hamilton Woman (1941). There was almost a fourth film together in 1944 when Olivier and Leigh traveled to Scotland with Charles C. Bennett to research the real-life story of a Scottish girl accused of murdering her French lover. Bennett recalled that Olivier researched the story \"with all the thoroughness of Sherlock Holmes\" and \"we unearthed evidence, never known or produced at the trial, that would most certainly have sent the young lady to the gallows\". The film project was then abandoned. During their two-decade marriage, Olivier and Leigh appeared on the stage in England and America and made films whenever they really needed to make some money. In 1951, Olivier was working on a screen adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel \"Sister Carrie\" (Carrie (1952)) while Leigh was completing work on the film version of the Tennessee Williams' play, A Streetcar Named Desire (1951). She won her second Oscar for bringing \"Blanche DuBois\" to the screen. Carrie (1952) was a film that Olivier never talked about. George Hurstwood, a middle-aged married man from Chicago who tricked a young woman into leaving a younger man about to marry her, became a New York street person in the novel. Olivier played him as a somewhat nicer person who didn't fall quite as low. A PBS documentary on Olivier's career broadcast in 1987 covered his first sojourn in Hollywood in the early 1930s with his first wife, Jill Esmond, and noted that her star was higher than his at that time. On film, he was upstaged by his second wife, too, even though the list of films he made is four times as long as hers. More than half of his film credits come after The Entertainer (1960), which started out as a play in London in 1957. When the play moved across the Atlantic to Broadway in 1958, the role of \"Archie Rice\"'s daughter was taken over by Joan Plowright, who was also in the film. They married soon after the release of The Entertainer (1960).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNjYwNDE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzg0MDQ2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000059","name":"Laurence Olivier","nicknames":["Larry","Kim"],"idIMDB":"nm0000059"},"actorId":"nm0000059","character":"Andrew Wyke","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017488","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Caine","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 March 1933","placeOfBirth":" Rotherhithe, London, England, UK","birthName":"Maurice Joseph Micklewhite","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen Frances Marie (Burchell), a charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish-market porter. He left school at 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the years that followed he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit, \"The Long and the Short and the Tall.\" Zulu (1964), the 1964 epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-'60s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), Play Dirty (1969), Battle of Britain (1969), Too Late the Hero (1970), The Last Valley (1971) and especially Get Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command. There were some gems amongst the dross, however. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Educating Rita (1983) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999) (his second Oscar) and Last Orders (2001) have been widely acclaimed.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","name":"Michael Caine","idIMDB":"nm0000323"},"actorId":"nm0000323","character":"Milo Tindle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017487","main":true},{"actorName":"Alec Cawthorne","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147250","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Alec Cawthorne is an actor, known for Sleuth (1972).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147250","name":"Alec Cawthorne","idIMDB":"nm0147250"},"actorId":"nm0147250","character":"Inspector Doppler","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0033019","main":true},{"actorName":"John Matthews","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0560064","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"John Matthews is an actor, known for Sleuth (1972).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0560064","name":"John Matthews","idIMDB":"nm0560064"},"actorId":"nm0560064","character":"Detective Sergeant Tarrant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0033020","main":true},{"actorName":"Eve Channing","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151920","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Eve Channing is an actress, known for Sleuth (1972).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151920","name":"Eve Channing","idIMDB":"nm0151920"},"actorId":"nm0151920","character":"Marguerite Wyke","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0033021","main":true},{"actorName":"Teddy Martin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0553117","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Teddy Martin is an actor, known for Sleuth (1972).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0553117","name":"Teddy Martin","idIMDB":"nm0553117"},"actorId":"nm0553117","character":"Police Constable Higgs","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0298797","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0069281","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069281","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"€368,514","country":"Spain","day":"20","month":"02","year":"2003","remarks":""},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/2001/\">2001</a>"},{"money":"767,183","country":"Spain","day":"20","month":"02","year":"2003","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 hr 18 min (138 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono (Westrex Recording System)"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1 (theatrical ratio)"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["DeLuxe, Hollywood (CA), USA"],"filmLength":["3,805 m (1974) (Finland)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"8.1","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Athelhampton House, Athelhampton, Dorset, England, UK"}],"rated":"PG","awards":[{"award":"Academy Awards, USA 1973","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Oscar","categories":[{"category":"Best Actor in a Leading Role","names":[{"name":"Michael Caine","id":"nm0000323","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Actor in a Leading Role","names":[{"name":"Laurence Olivier","id":"nm0000059","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Director","names":[{"name":"Joseph L.
