Her remarkable talent expressed itself both in cinema and theater. She reached international popularity in the 1930s, especially in France, Germany and Austria, and became the only international movie star produced by the fascist cinema. In the 1950s, when her film career began declining, she played on stage in Italy, the US (\"Mike McCauley\", 1951), France (\"Le serpent à sonettes\", 1953) and England (\"Orpheus Descending\" by Tennessee Williams, 1959), receiving positive reviews everywhere. In the 1960s she started a TV career in England, appearing in many made-for-TV movies. She was a versatile actress, exceedingly sensible, a charming woman, and unjustly forgotten at the end of her life even by those who should have remembered her.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkxMDM2Nzk3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQzNDAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0592109","name":"Isa Miranda","idIMDB":"nm0592109"},"actorId":"nm0592109","character":"Maria Brunetti","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Filippo Scelzo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0769380","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 April 1900","placeOfBirth":" Ivrea, Piedmont, Italy","bio":"Filippo Scelzo was born on April 19, 1900 in Ivrea, Piedmont, Italy.
