His father was of Russian Jewish descent, and his maternal grandparents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. As a young boy, he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet, two hobbies that he continues today. Allen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper, receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents, Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins, convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and, although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes, he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years, he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: Quoi de neuf, Pussycat? (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production, Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers, who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time. It was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody's theoretical directorial debut was in What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Take the Money and Run (1969). He has written, directed and, more often than not, starred in about a film a year ever since, while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy. While best known for his romantic comedies Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979), Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years, transitioning from his \"early, funny ones\" of Bananas (1971), Love and Death (1975) and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Annie Hall (1977), Manhattan (1979) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Interiors (1978); and then on to the more recent, but varied works of Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), Husbands and Wives (1992), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), _Celebrity_ and Deconstructing Harry (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade, which vary from the light comedy of Scoop (2006), to the self-destructive darkness of Match Point (2005) and, most recently, to the cinematically beautiful tale of Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Although his stories and style have changed over the years, he is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of our time because of his views on art and his mastery of filmmaking.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MjU3MTI2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgxNTE4MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095","name":"Woody Allen","idIMDB":"nm0000095"},"actorId":"nm0000095","character":"Sheldon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0034292","main":true},{"actorName":"Marvin Chatinover","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0154059","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 April 1927","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","bio":"Born in California, later graduated from Yale and moved to New York.

Her parents and grandparents forced her to leave the Theatre Guild school (New York) while still a teenager and had their wills drawn up accordingly so as to discourage this career choice. Studied drama at Columbia University, and belonged to the American Theatre Wing. When Mae was 17 and living in the South Bronx, she won a local contest to find the girl who most resembled Helen Kane, a popular singer known as the \"Boop-Oop-A-Doop Queen\". She was promptly signed by an agent and began performing in the Vaudeville circuit. Billing herself as \"Mae Questel - Personality Singer of Personality Songs,\" she performed dead-on vocal imitations of Maurice Chevalier, Eddie Cantor, Fanny Brice, Marlene Dietrich, Mae West and of course Helen Kane, among many others. Her mimic talent also provided duck, dog, chicken, owl, monkey, lion and baby sounds for radio shows. Betty Boop creator Max Fleischer heard Mae doing her \"boop-oop-a-doop\" routine and hired her to do the character's voice in 1931. She served as the voice on more than 150 Betty Boop animated shorts until the character was retired in 1939. Her recording of \"On The Good Ship Lollipop\" sold more than 2 million during the Depression. Best known as the voice of \"Betty Boop\", she was also the voice of not so less famous \"Olive Oyl\" in the Popeye's cartoons, but also the toddler Swee'pea, and others. She did Popeye's voice once, in the cartoon Shape Ahoy (1945), because Jack Mercer was serving in the military during World War II. Her versatility is probably better appreciated in the cartoon Never Kick a Woman (1936) in which she provides the quivery, nervous-Nellie voice of Olive Oyl, based on comedic actress Zasu Pitts, and the deep, assured, alluring voice of the blonde saleswoman, based on Mae West. In 1968, the City of Indianapolis honored her with a \"Mae Questel Day\". In 1979, she won the Troupers Award for outstanding contribution to entertainment.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MDc0NDY4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQyNzYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0703362","name":"Mae Questel","idIMDB":"nm0703362"},"actorId":"nm0703362","character":"Mother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mia Farrow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3NjgxMzQ5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEzNTkzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 February 1945","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Maria de Lourdes Villiers-Farrow","height":"5' 4¼\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Mia Farrow was born in Los Angeles, California, to director John Farrow and actress and Tarzan-girl Maureen O'Sullivan.
