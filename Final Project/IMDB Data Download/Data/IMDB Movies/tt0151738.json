Drew Blyth Barrymore was born in Culver City, California, to actors John Drew Barrymore and Jaid Barrymore (née Ildiko Jaid Mako). Her father came from a long showbusiness legacy, as the son of actors John Barrymore and Dolores Costello, while her mother was the daughter of Hungarian refugees. Despite a troubled and much-publicized adolescence, and a string of \"bad girl\" parts in lurid crime dramas such as Poison Ivy (1992), Barrymore's star was officially on the rise during the mid-1990s, with notable appearances in Boys on the Side (1995), Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996), and the game-changing horror hit Scream (1996). An eclectic mix of high-profile and low-key film projects followed - such as The Wedding Singer (1998), Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998), Never Been Kissed (1999), Charlie's Angels (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), Riding in Cars with Boys (2001) and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) - proving to once-cynical audiences that Barrymore was not only a capable leading lady, but also a gifted and versatile actor. Next came headlining parts in Duplex (2003), 50 First Dates (2004), Fever Pitch (2005), Music and Lyrics (2007), Lucky You (2007), He's Just Not That Into You (2009), and the much-lauded Grey Gardens (2009), for which she earned Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards for her portrayal of Edith Bouvier Beale. In 2009, Barrymore - whose production company, Flower Films, has spawned several lucrative features - made her long-awaited directional debut with the comedy-drama Whip It (2009), emerging as \"a sensitive director who knows how and when to let an emotional moment linger on the screen\" (TIME). Alongside a recurring guest spot - as the voice of Jillian - on the cult animated series Family Guy (1999), recent acting roles have included Everybody's Fine (2009), Going the Distance (2010), Big Miracle (2012), Blended (2014), and Miss You Already (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyOTMzODIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM2NTY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000106","name":"Drew Barrymore","nicknames":["D"],"idIMDB":"nm0000106"},"actorId":"nm0000106","character":"Josie Geller","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012260","main":true},{"actorName":"David Arquette","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000274","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzODYyNjg3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYwOTgyNg@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 September 1971","placeOfBirth":" Winchester, Virginia, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"The youngest of five, David Arquette was born in Winchester, Virginia and is part of the illustrious Arquette family, whose work has spread over several generations.

His paternal grandfather, Cliff Arquette, was also an entertainer. David's mother was from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Poland and Russia), while David's father had French-Canadian, Swiss-German, and English ancestry. Like his siblings, Arquette started working at an early age, and his first major role came as Luke Perry's character's best friend in the hit film Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992). But his major break both personally and professionally didn't come until 1996 when he was cast in the slasher flick Scream (1996) starring opposite close friend Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell and more importantly Friends (1994), with Courteney Cox who he married in San Francisco in the summer of 1999. Scream (1996) earned worldwide success and acclaim as did Arquette for his role as lovable simple cop \"Dewey\". His role proved to be so popular that in the original script his character was meant to die, but due to test audiences response to Dewey the script was changed and he returned for both Scream 2 (1997) and Scream 3 (2000). Usually known for his goofiness in more mainstream roles, his greatest performances and reviews have come for his indie films such as Johns (1996), Dream with the Fishes (1997) and The Grey Zone (2001).

With an astonishing range of roles already under his belt, John C. Reilly has played an eclectic host of rich characters to great effect over the years, from seedy ne'er-do-wells, to lovable, good-natured schlepps. The fifth of six children, John Christopher Reilly was born in Chicago, to a father of mostly Irish descent, and a Lithuanian-American mother, and was brought up on Chicago's tough Southwest territory. His father, also named John, ran an industrial linen supply company business. On the amateur stage from age eight, Reilly trained at the Goodman School of Drama and eventually became a member of Chicago's renowned Steppenwolf Theatre. His film break came with a small role in the Vietnam War drama Casualties of War (1989), wherein Brian De Palma liked his work so much during the early stages that he recast him in a major role by the start of shooting as a soldier bent on rape. Reilly gained momentum throughout the 1990s and showed his dazzling stretch of talent in such films as Days of Thunder (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) and The River Wild (1994). He became a major stock player in director Paul Thomas Anderson's films, while finding some of his best roles in Hard Eight (1996) as a compulsive gambler, Boogie Nights (1997) in which he played a narcissistic porn star, and in Magnolia (1999) as a compassionate policeman. He went on to earn further critical points for his role of the soldier sent to the front lines in Terrence Malick's war epic The Thin Red Line (1998). On stage, Reilly has wowed audiences in \"The Grapes of Wrath\" on Broadway, \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"Othello\" at Steppenwolf, and earned an Outer Critics Circle Award and Tony nomination for \"True West\" alongside another impeccable character player Philip Seymour Hoffman. Reilly finally received the film recognition he deserved in 2002 with a slew of choice, high-profile parts in The Hours (2002), The Good Girl (2002), Gangs of New York (2002), and especially Chicago (2002) as the put-upon husband, Amos Hart, who is played for a patsy by murderous wife Roxie (Renée Zellweger). For this last part, he received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Since then his stock has risen considerably, and he has further widened his cinematic repertoire, appearing in everything from dramatic roles - We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011), Aviator (2004) and Carnage (2011) - to broader comic turns - Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007), Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), Step Brothers (2008), Cyrus (2010) and Cedar Rapids (2011). Most recently, he has voiced the lead in Disney's animated smash Wreck-It Ralph (2012). Reilly is married to producer Alison Dickey.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MDEzMDkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzNzcy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000604","name":"John C.

An agent spotted his stand-out performance and began booking a series of small roles and directing opportunities. Derek-along with a few ambitious producers-directed a production of \"Hair\" in Houston, Texas to favorable reviews. His theater experience also includes working as co-director for the gospel musical \"Calling All Saints\" presented at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. Derek's breakthrough role as Thomas Gibson on Lifetime's \"For The People,\" was heralded for his charisma and unique presence on the small screen. The television series \"Joan of Arcadia\" gave him a chance to share the spotlight with some of the industry's best actors and directors. Derek's lead performance in the critically acclaimed theatrical production of \"Black Olive\" in Los Angeles, led to his NAACP Theatre Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. A native of the Spanish Harlem section of New York City, Derek spent his summers acting in stock theatre as a youth. While attending Benjamin Franklin High School, Derek started acting in the episodic radio show \"Compositions Live\" on WBAI Pacifica Radio. This became his outlet from negative activities, keeping him focused and out of trouble in school and on the streets of East Harlem. A lover of learning, Derek graduated from California State University at Fullerton with a Bachelors degree in acting. At UCLA, he taught MFA students and worked alongside playwright August Wilson. He is proud to have served a tour in the U.S. Navy as a hospital corpsman (medic). Derek's most recent work includes an appearance on Comedy Central's \"Onion Sports Dome,\" and he is co-starring in a movie-of-the-week, \"Gun Hill,\" playing opposite actor Larenz Tate. Directed by Reggie Rock Bythewood, \"Gun Hill\" is slated to premiere in the 2013-2014 season. He is also featured in Morgan Stanley's new ad campaign, Merck ads, and an upcoming Lovaza campaign.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQwNzM2Mzc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAyMDgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604608","name":"Derek Morgan","idIMDB":"nm0604608"},"actorId":"nm0604608","character":"Armcast Henson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kathleen Marshall","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0550982","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMzUyMDg1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODE2OTk2._V1_UY44_CR10,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 December 1967","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Kathleen Susan Marshall","height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Kathleen Marshall is a graduate of Northwestern University who made her New York theatre debut in the Off-Broadway production of 'Wrong Turn at Lungfish' at the Promenade Theatre.
