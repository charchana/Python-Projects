His early exposure to theatre, particularly in London, led him to Seattle's Cornish Institute. After graduation he found a minor role as Sailor #1 in River Phoenix's Dogfight (1991), then somewhat more substantial roles in Encino Man (1992) and School Ties (1992). He expresses a preference for playing \"fish out of water\" men. Five more years of supporting work led finally to the title role in George of the Jungle (1997), a role which fully utilized his charm and beefy good looks, as well as offering him a chance to show off his comic talents. He describes this role as the one which dramatically altered his career.

The show ran for four years, opening the door wide for him for television and film roles. In 1993, he wrote and starred in a one-hour HBO television special, Pauly Does Dallas (1993), which drew in even more loyal fans. He had roles in films from 1988, providing supporting comedy relief, but it was the wildly popular Encino Man (1992), partnered with Sean Astin and Brendan Fraser, that put Pauly squarely on the map. Manic showcases followed, including Son in Law (1993), In the Army Now (1994), Jury Duty (1995), Bio-Dome (1996) and The Curse of Inferno (1997). However, Shore was met with an increasingly hostile reception and his lunacy was dismissed as crude, dumb and, for the most part, unfunny. His film career quickly tanked. This downhill spiral was not helped by the abrupt cancellation of his failed Fox sitcom Pauly (1997). Lambasted unmercifully by both critics and media alike, he was soon becoming a running joke and forced to lie low and ride out the storm. He provided voices in animated features such as Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and An Extremely Goofy Movie (2000). In better days, his first comedy album, \"The Future of America,\" was named Best Comedy Album by the college music journalists in 1991, while the National Association of Record Merchandisers nominated his second album, \"Scraps from the Future,\" for a Best Sellers Award. His third album, \"Pink Diggly Diggly,\" was taped live at his mother Mitzi Shore's famed Los Angeles improv club The Comedy Store, where Pauly received his stand-up comedy initiation. Pauly has made do in recent years as a recurring guest on Howard Stern's late-night show, as well as David Letterman's and Craig Kilborn's talk shows. And, of course, he tours the country with his stand-up act. He's been surrounded by show business all his life. In addition to mother Mitzi, father Sammy Shore was a well-known comedian who once opened for Elvis Presley during the Vegas years, while older brother Peter Shore has delved into producing/directing TV endeavors. In a career that skyrocketed quickly only to make a serious crash landing, never-say-die Pauly's latest bid for a comeback is the self-mockumentary Pauly Shore Is Dead (2003), which he directed and co-wrote.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2OTUyMzIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUwMjg4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001736","name":"Pauly Shore","nicknames":["The Weasel"],"idIMDB":"nm0001736"},"actorId":"nm0001736","character":"Stoney Brown","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017968","main":true},{"actorName":"Megan Ward","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0911725","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MTExNDgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY5NjUwMDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 September 1969","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Megan Marie Ward","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Megan Ward was born on September 24, 1969 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Megan Marie Ward.

Ducommun grew up on a farm, the son of an entrepreneur father with whom he did not get along. Running away from home at age 14, he hitchhiked around the northern U.S., often living in communes, until returning to Canada at age 17, this time to Vancouver. On a dare, Ducommun tried to do stand-up comedy at a Vancouver club. He was not only asked back, but bitten by the show business bug. He began playing clubs in Canada, hosted his own children's show, \"ZigZag,\" and was put on TV by Alan Thicke, who was then hosting a talk show out of Vancouver. When Thicke made his deal to do Thicke of the Night (1983), a late-night talk show from L.A., he brought Ducommun down to be announcer and a performer. When the show flopped, Ducommun began performing at L.A. clubs and acting in sitcoms. He was one of the zany cops on The Last Precinct (1986) -- a short-lived NBC show, and Mahler on Max Headroom (1987). Ducommun also played small parts in films, beginning with No Small Affair (1984) but found himself limited by a frame carrying 426 lb. He slimmed down more than 200 lb., and won the role of Art Weingartner, the dumb lug nosy neighbor to Tom Hanks in The 'Burbs (1989). Despite good reaction to his work, the film was not a success, and Ducommun found himself mixing live performances in with his occasional film work, including an appearance in Blank Check (1994). HBO did a special with Ducommun in 1989 called Rick Ducommun: Piece of Mind (1989), which was well received, as was the follow-up, \"Hit and Run\" in 1992. Ducommun frequently hosted pay and cable programs featuring stand-up comedy and was an regular performer on the Comedy Channel, later renamed, Comedy Central.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjk3ODE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzYxNjIwNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0239958","name":"Rick Ducommun","idIMDB":"nm0239958"},"actorId":"nm0239958","character":"Mr. Brush","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0273963","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Ke Quan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702841","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTQyMzY2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQwNDczMw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 August 1971","placeOfBirth":" Saigon, Vietnam","birthName":"Ke Huy-Quan","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Graduated from the University of Southern California School of Cinema Television.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNTQyMzY2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQwNDczMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702841","name":"Jonathan Ke Quan","idIMDB":"nm0702841"},"actorId":"nm0702841","character":"Kim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0273965","main":true},{"actorName":"Mariette Hartley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366866","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNTkzOTUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA2Mjg3._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 June 1940","placeOfBirth":" Weston, Connecticut, USA","birthName":"Mary Loretta Hartley","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Mariette Hartley was born Mary Loretta, a name she dislikes, in Weston, Connecticut. She was raised in accordance with the principles espoused by her behavioral psychologist grandfather, John B. Watson, who believed that children should never be held or cuddled. She says that the lack of warmth at home is what drove her to the theatre. She studied with John Houseman at the Repertory Stratford and with Eva Le Gallienne at Lucille Lortel's White Barn Theatre. It took her six years to get her first movie, Ride the High Country (1962) with Joel McCrea. She then made a series of TV appearances and sitcoms. Ultimately, she appeared with co-host Bill Beutel on \"A.M. America\", the predecessor to ABC's Good Morning America (1975). She is most known, however, for her series of Polaroid commercials with James Garner. Mariette's father committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot in 1962. Her family kept it a secret for 25 years, but she eventually revealed the incident. This brought her considerable acclaim for speaking out about her devastation. She co-founded a suicide prevention foundation based on her own past situation. She continues to work in the theatre and, in 2000, was hosting the syndicated Wild About Animals (1995). Her children, Justine E. Boyriven (b. 1978) is an actress and singer, and Sean Boyriven (b. 1975) is a film-school graduate.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNTkzOTUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA2Mjg3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366866","name":"Mariette Hartley","idIMDB":"nm0366866"},"actorId":"nm0366866","character":"Mrs. Morgan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0273989","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Masur","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0557956","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4MzU5NTQyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk5NzkyOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 November 1948","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Masur has also been active in the theatre with increasing frequency.
