Her father, Caleb Deschanel, is an Academy Award-nominated cinematographer (perhaps most notably for The Passion of the Christ (2004)) and her mother, Mary Jo Deschanel (née Weir), is an actress who appeared in Twin Peaks (1990). Her paternal grandfather was French, and her other roots include English, German, Scottish, Irish, and Dutch. Driven from an early age to become a successful actress, Zooey got her big break, at age 17, playing a model in the TV sitcom, Veronica's Closet (1997). She got her first film role, the following year, in Mumford (1999), which prompted her to quit university to pursue acting full-time. Mostly thanks to a role in Cameron Crowe's popular biopic, Almost Famous (2000), Zooey's rise to fame has been steadily increasing as the 21st century wears on. Her distinctive acting style found her critical acclaim in 2003, when she was voted Best Actress at the Mar Del Plata Film Festival for her role in David Gordon Green's All the Real Girls (2003). She also gained a Best Female Lead nomination (for All the Real Girls (2003)) at the following year's Independent Spirit Awards, but lost out to Charlize Theron. Zooey has appeared in such films as 500 Days of Summer (2009), Our Idiot Brother (2011), Yes Man (2008) (opposite Jim Carrey), Elf (2003) (opposite Will Farrell), Your Highness (2011), The Happening (2008) (opposite Mark Wahlberg), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005) and is the star of the FOX sitcom, New Girl (2011). Zooey is often compared to golden era Hollywood starlets and is also a talented singer. She has said in interviews that she believes her singing ability was pivotal in gaining the role of \"Jovie\" in Elf (2003). She also sang (and acted) in the Disney-produced musical, The Wonderful World of Disney: Once Upon a Mattress (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMjM2NDE1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA2NDU5OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221046","name":"Zooey Deschanel","nicknames":["Zo","Zuzu"],"idIMDB":"nm0221046"},"actorId":"nm0221046","character":"Reese Holden","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0295176","main":true},{"actorName":"Darrell Larson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0488970","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzgxMDU5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTMyNzI0MDI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1950","placeOfBirth":" Tracy, California, USA","birthName":"Darrell Ray Larson","bio":"Darrell Larson was born on December 13, 1950 in Tracy, California, USA as Darrell Ray Larson.

Lloyd moved to Manhattan and began a career onstage, in film and on television in the early 1980s, generally in supporting roles. In the movies, the physically-imposing Lloyd (he is 6' 5\" tall) is probably best known for his supporting parts in Crossing Delancey (1988) and The Abyss (1989).

A graduate of the University of Southern California, Ferrell became interested in performing while a student at University High School in Irvine, where he made his school's daily morning announcements over the public address system in disguised voices. He started as a member of the Los Angeles comedy/improvisation group The Groundlings, where fellow cast members Ana Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and former Saturday Night Live (1975) repertory players such as Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman began their careers. It was there he met Chris Kattan and the two became good friends and both went on to Saturday Night Live (1975) later. He has also appeared on several television programs, including Strangers with Candy (1999), Grace Under Fire (1993) and Living Single (1993) during his time at The Groundlings. Will also lent his voice to the armless and legless dad of cartoon family \"The Oblongs\". In 1995 he became a feature cast member at Saturday Night Live (1975) during the show's rapid re-casting. He was declared quite possibly the worst cast member ever during his first season.

He's appeared in every Saturday Night Live (1975) movie since his premiere on the show in 1995.
