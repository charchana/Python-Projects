Attending the University of Washington after high school, she received her BA degree in fine arts. Her first professional season was with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival where she performed in \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" among others. During this time she built up a strong resume in regional theater with such companies as the Hartford Stage Company, Pittsburgh Public Theatre, Seattle Repertory Theatre, Alaska Repertory Theatre and Alliance Theatre. Her first significant break came with a starring role in the potent, critically-acclaimed lesbian drama \"Last Summer at Bluefish Cove,\" which earned her an Off-Broadway Drama Desk nomination in 1980. She capped this honor with a Los Angeles Drama Critics award in 1983 when she repeated her triumph on the West Coast. Jean made an auspicious Broadway debut in 1981 playing Marlene Dietrich in \"Piaf\", and it was the subsequent TV taping of that show that brought about Hollywood interest. She struggled for a time in unsuccessful sitcoms (Teachers Only (1982), Reggie (1983) and Maximum Security (1984)) before hitting gold as the feather-brained Charlene Frazier on Designing Women (1986). She met future husband Richard Gilliland on the set of the hit show; he played the recurring role of Annie Potts' boyfriend for a few seasons. Jean and Richard's son Connor was born in 1989. Feeling confined and typecast in light material, Jean left the show in 1991 to branch out and drew major acclaim in such made-for-TV movies as Overkill: The Aileen Wuornos Story (1992). She gave a chilling portrayal as the well-known serial killer more than a decade before Charlize Theron copped an Oscar for her cinematic version. On the other side of the coin, Jean offered gentle, heartfelt performances in such TV films as The Yarn Princess (1994), in which she played a mentally disabled mom, and the TV remake of The Yearling (1994), allowing audiences to rediscover her amazing versatility. On stage she earned a Tony nomination for her delightfully madcap part in the Broadway farce \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" opposite Nathan Lane, and on TV won bookend Emmy awards for her guest appearances on the sitcom Frasier (1993). Films would never be a reliable venue for Jean, who made her big-screen debut in Flashpoint (1984). She did, however, receive an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her part in Guinevere (1999). Diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at age 13, Jean has played an active part over the years in public awareness.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNjg0MjUxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyNjY0MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005443","name":"Jean Smart","idIMDB":"nm0005443"},"actorId":"nm0005443","character":"Claire Cavanee","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sarah Habel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3080981","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODAzOTEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc0MjMxMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Sarah Evelyn Habel was born in Michigan and gained a BA in Theater from Michigan State University.

He also shined as Reverend Dimmesdale (one of America's first religious hypocrites) in the 1979 PBS version of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (1979). Both \"Chilly Scenes of Winter\" and Cutter's Way\" (originally released as \"Head Over Heels\" and \"Cutter and Bone\", respectively) had been re-released under new titles after failing in their first go-rounds, such was the quality of the films. The two re-releases helped redefine the practice by which major studios handled smaller, art house quality pictures by releasing them carefully to select theaters with bespoke marketing campaigns so they reached the proper audience. (Studios would later develop their own art film-independent film subsidiaries to handle such pictures, so they didn't \"fall through the cracks\" like the first releases of the two Heard films.) By the early 1980s John Heard seemed on his way to establishing himself as a major American actor if not on the path to movie stardom. At the time, there was joke that involved confusing Heard with John Hurt and William Hurt because of the similarity of their last names. At the time these contemporaries were considered equal in terms of their star power. That was 30 years ago. William Hurt (the erstwhile husband of Heard's \"Head Over Heels\" co-star Mary Beth Hurt) went on to win a Best Actor Oscar as well as enjoy leading man status as a movie star in the mid- to late-'80s before he flared out in the early 1990s. John Hurt become one of the most respected actors of his generation, nominated twice for the Academy Award. Among Heard's co-stars of his early endeavors, Bridges and Spacek also went on to win Oscars and Nolte has been a multiple nominee. In the early '80s it would not have been unreasonable to predict that Heard himself would become an Oscar winner or a multiple nominee. That didn't happen. (He did get nominated for an Emmy for his turn as a corrupt police detective on The Sopranos (1999).) Heard now is best known for his two turns as Macaulay Culkin's father in the Home Alone (1990) movies. In the 1980s he continued to work on A-List projects, playing the not-so-sympathetic son to Geraldine Page in The Trip to Bountiful (1985) (for which Page won her own Oscar) and Tom Hanks's adult rival in Big (1988) (for which Hanks won his first Oscar nomination), but this meant that by the latter part of the decade he had failed to establish himself as a leading man and was doing supporting roles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzczODkyNzY4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU0NjQzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001334","name":"John Heard","idIMDB":"nm0001334"},"actorId":"nm0001334","character":"Jack Cavanee","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Austin Stowell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3271473","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2OTk0ODEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc3ODY3NTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Austin Stowell was born and raised in Kensington, Connecticut, by his father, Robert, a retired steelworker, and his mother, Elizabeth, a schoolteacher.
