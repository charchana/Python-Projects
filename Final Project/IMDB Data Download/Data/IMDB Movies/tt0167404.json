Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts. Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene K. (from Kassel), and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role. After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series Moonlighting (1985). The series firmly established Bruce Willis as a hot new talent, and his sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. was in effect a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit Die Hard (1988). This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis' character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Willis reprized the role of tough guy cop \"John McClane\" in the eagerly anticipated sequel Die Hard 2 (1990) set at snowbound Washington's Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) this time also starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shopowner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in NYC. Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of \"Mikey\" the baby in the very popular family comedies Look Who's Talking (1989), and its sequel Look Who's Talking Too (1990) also starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) and Hudson Hawk (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyperviolent The Last Boy Scout (1991), the darkly humored Death Becomes Her (1992) and the mediocre police thriller Striking Distance (1993). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing North (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in the Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Pulp Fiction (1994), the Terry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller Twelve Monkeys (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus The Fifth Element (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic The Sixth Sense (1999). Willis next starred in the gangster comedy The Whole Nine Yards (2000), worked again with \"hot\" director M. Night Shyamalan in the less gripping Unbreakable (2000), and in two military dramas, Hart's War (2002) and Tears of the Sun (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Sin City (2005), the voice of \"RJ\" the scheming raccoon in the animated hit Over the Hedge (2006) and \"Die Hard\" fans rejoiced to see \"John McClane\" return to the big screen in the high tech Live Free or Die Hard (2007) aka \"Die Hard 4.0\". Willis was married to actress Demi Moore for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjMzMTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ2ODE3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246","name":"Bruce Willis","nicknames":["Bruno"],"idIMDB":"nm0000246"},"actorId":"nm0000246","character":"Dr. Malcolm Crowe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002332","main":true},{"actorName":"Haley Joel Osment","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005286","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDQyMDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDIxMjMz._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 April 1988","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Haley Joel Osment is an American actor who has proven himself as one of the best young actors of his generation. He is the first millennial male to have received an Academy Award nomination for acting. Osment was born in Los Angeles, California, to Theresa (Seifert), a teacher, and actor Eugene Osment. His sister is actress Emily Osment. His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish. Osment began acting at the age of four, when he tried out for a Pizza Hut commercial in a shopping mall. The commercial launched his career, and he landed his first television role later that year. As a young child, his first film role was as Forrest Gump (1994)'s son, also named Forrest Gump, in the 1994 film of the same name as well as making a small appearance in Mixed Nuts (1994). He had roles in numerous TV series, including Thunder Alley (1994), The Jeff Foxworthy Show (1995), and, most notably, the final season of Murphy Brown (1988), in which he replaced Dyllan Christopher as Murphy's son Avery. Osment also made numerous guest appearances in various TV series, including The Larry Sanders Show (1992), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) (as a child dying from AIDS), Touched by an Angel (1994), Chicago Hope (1994), The Pretender (1996), and as a child dying from leukemia in the emotional episode 'Angels and Blimps' (1999) of the series Ally McBeal (1997). Osment starred in Bogus (1996) with Whoopi Goldberg and Gérard Depardieu, and appeared in the 1998 made-for-TV movie The Lake (1998) with Yasmine Bleeth, as well as I'll Remember April (2000) with future The Sixth Sense (1999) co-star Trevor Morgan. He first achieved stardom in 1999 when he appeared in the blockbuster The Sixth Sense (1999), co-starring Bruce Willis. For this role, Osment won the Saturn Award for best young actor. He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Michael Caine, with whom he would later star in Secondhand Lions (2003). Osment (voice) also made three minor guest appearances on Family Guy (1999) in 2000. One of Osment's lines in The Sixth Sense (1999), \"I see dead people,\" is often repeated or parodied on television programs and in other media. The 2000 Academy Awards ceremony honored another of Osment's future co-stars, BestActor Kevin Spacey, who, along with Helen Hunt, appeared in Osment's next film, Pay It Forward (2000). The following year, Osment appeared in Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), cementing his stature as one of the leading young actors in Hollywood. This role earned him his second Saturn Award. Also in 2001, Osment starred in a Polish film, Edges of the Lord (2001), as Romek. The movie was never released theatrically in the United States. Osment has since provided voices for The Country Bears (2002) and The Jungle Book 2 (2003). More recently, Osment was the voice of Sora, the main protagonist of the Walt Disney Company and Square-Enix's Kingdom Hearts (2002) video-game series, which was extremely financially successful as well and generally well-received critically. He was also the voice of Takeshi Jinno in the \"Time to Shine\" episode of the IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix (2005) animé TV series. Osment also worked in Home of the Giants (2007), playing a high school journalist opposite Ryan Merriman and Danielle Panabaker. He also played Helmuth Hübener in the film Truth & Treason (????). On July 20, 2006, Osment was injured in a one-car accident. His blood-alcohol content was measured at 0.16%, twice the legal limit in California. On August 18, he was charged with four misdemeanors, including driving under the influence of alcohol and possession of marijuana while driving. He pleaded no contest on October 19 and was sentenced to three years' probation, 60 hours in an alcohol-rehabilitation and education program, a fine of $1,500, and a minimum requirement of 26 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over a six-month period.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDQyMDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDIxMjMz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005286","name":"Haley Joel Osment","nicknames":["HJO"],"idIMDB":"nm0005286"},"actorId":"nm0005286","character":"Cole Sear","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002335","main":true},{"actorName":"Toni Collette","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001057","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNDU0MjQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgwMjMxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 November 1972","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","birthName":"Antonia Collette","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Toni Collette is an Academy Award-nominated Australian actress, best known for her roles in The Sixth Sense (1999) and Little Miss Sunshine (2006). Collette was born Toni Collett (she later added an \"e\") on November 1, 1972, in Blacktown, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. She is the first of three children of Judith (Cook), a customer service representative, and Bob Collett, a truck driver. From age six, she was brought up in suburban Sydney. At the age of eleven, she showed her phenomenal acting skills when she faked appendicitis out of boredom and longing for attention; her act was so convincing that doctors had to remove her appendix, even though the test showed nothing was wrong with it. At 16, she left school and enrolled in the National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA). At that time, she was a struggling actress, supporting herself by delivering pizzas. After 18 months of studies, she left NIDA for her feature film debut as \"Wendy Robinson\", opposite Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins, in The Efficiency Expert (1992), and earned herself a nomination for Best Supporting Actress from the Australian Film Institute. Collette made her stage debut with the Sydney Theatre Company, as \"Sonya\" in Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya\", a performance that won her a critic's circle award as Best Newcomer. She also appeared in stage productions at the Belvoir Street Theatre, under directorship of Geoffrey Rush. In 1994, she won the Australian Best Actress in a Lead Role for her work in Muriel (1994), for which she had to gain 40 pounds in seven weeks. In 1995, Toni Collette came to Hollywood with a supporting role in The Pallbearer (1996), then had a string of supporting roles. Her first lead as \"Diana Spencer\", an Australian woman who shares the name and birthday of Princess Diana, in the comedy, Diana & Me (1997), was obscured by the real Diana's death, which practically occurred at the same time when the movie was released. Her breakthrough came with the role as \"Lynn Sear\" in The Sixth Sense (1999), for which she quite rightly won an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Her latest memorable role as \"Sheryl\", a beaten-down but loving mother, in Little Miss Sunshine (2006), is also a fine ensemble work with Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Paul Dano, and Alan Arkin. Since 2003, Toni Collette has been married to musician Dave Galafassi, with whom she recorded her singing and songwriting debut album, titled \"Beautiful Awkward Pictures\", in 2006. She co-owns an independent production company in Australia, and also continues her music career as a singer. Toni resides with her husband in Sydney, Australia, and owns a second home in Ireland.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNDU0MjQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgwMjMxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001057","name":"Toni Collette","idIMDB":"nm0001057"},"actorId":"nm0001057","character":"Lynn Sear","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002334","main":true},{"actorName":"Olivia Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931404","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MzczNjQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1MzIzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 July 1968","placeOfBirth":" Camden Town, London, England, UK","birthName":"Olivia Haigh Williams","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Olivia Williams was born July 26, 1968 in Camden Town, London.

He is the eighth of nine children of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. His parents eventually divorced and Donnie, finding himself already in trouble, discovered a positive outlet performing in school plays and became involved in varied aspects of theater -- acting, writing, and directing. At the age of 15, he became a member of the teen vocal group originally called \"NYNUK.\" Donnie's younger brother, Mark Wahlberg, was originally one of the Boys but balked at the direction the group was taking and backed out. Following a false start with their debut album \"New Kids on the Block,\" the teens persevered with a sophomore record and proceeded to hit #1 with the single \"Please Don't Go Girl\" in 1988. They continued to bombard the market with one-after-another \"Top Ten\" hits including \"The Right Stuff\" and \"I'll Be Loving You Forever.\" Leaving the young girls panting for more, they became one of the hottest young singing/line-dancing groups to hit the late 80s/early 90s. The Boys went on to sell over 70 million albums worldwide, and provoke the spawning of other five-member harmony groups such as Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. During its heyday, Donnie played up his resident \"bad boy\" persona by tallying up several run-ins with the law, including an alleged arson at a Kentucky hotel (charges were dropped). He also delved into \"body art\" with numerous tattoos and body piercings in an effort to buck their already-cloying image. Amid intergroup dissension and Milli Vanilli-like charges of not contributing all the vocals to their albums, the pop band finally disbanded in 1994 -- partly out of frustration but also having outgrown the group's juvenile moniker. Unsure of his direction while attracting more trouble in the tabloids, Donnie, who helped write, arrange and produce brother Mark's Funky Bunch group's first two albums a few years earlier, switched gears. He rapped some and modeled some, then transformed himself into an actor, a route taken earlier by his talented bro. While Mark has turned out to become the bigger film star over the years, Donnie has stepped out of his shadows to receive raves and renewed respect for his own tense and compelling character work. He first showed up in big screen action. Making his debut as a \"tough guy\" thug in the Mickey Rourke urban outing Bullet (1996), filmed in 1994 but not released until two years later. Usually cast as an amoral heavy, Donnie moved up the quality ladder with director Ron Howard's thriller Ransom (1996) as part of a gang of kidnappers who nab Mel Gibson's son, to their eventual regret, of course. His next repellent took the form of a drug dealer in the goth indie horror Black Circle Boys (1997), but the film came and went. After a couple of TV movies, he finally nabbed a starring role in the film Southie (1998) playing more or less himself as an Irish-American prodigal son who returns to the mean streets of his native Boston. The movie also featured another brother Robert Wahlberg who also was testing the acting waters. Ironically, one of Donnie's most powerful roles during this period was also one of his briefest. Seen in the opening sequence, he is nearly unrecognizable (having dropped an alarming amount of weight) portraying a deranged former patient of psychiatrist Bruce Willis whose sudden explosion into unfathomable violence sets up the clever twists and turns that turned M. Night Shyamalan's classic psychological thriller The Sixth Sense (1999) into a critically-acclaimed box office hit. Donnie's opening bit was mouth dropping and jarring in its horror. He also proved he wasn't a flash in the pan by backing up this performance with a major role as a WWII paratrooper in the critically-hailed ten-part epic Band of Brothers (2001), which won multiple Emmy awards (6). This TV role directly led to his casting as a gritty L.A. detective in the NBC dramatic series Boomtown (2002), an acclaimed series that didn't survive a second season. Since then Donnie has patented his unrefined intensity into a number of other films such as Triggermen (2002) and Saw II (2005). He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Kim Fey, and sons Xavier and Elijah. As a former teen heartthrob seemingly headed down a troubled and dangerous path after his initial success, he somehow managed to avoid the traditional pitfalls of drugs and self-destruction, and has since proven himself an actor with \"the right stuff.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyOTY5NTAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzkwMDI0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005531","name":"Donnie Wahlberg","nicknames":["Donnie D","Cheese","Ddub"],"idIMDB":"nm0005531"},"actorId":"nm0005531","character":"Vincent Grey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0110916","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Anthony Tambakis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0848534","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI5MDk1OTE0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg1ODkxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 February 1984","placeOfBirth":"","bio":"Peter Anthony Tambakis was born on February 15, 1984.

From humble beginnings in New York Theater in 1994 where she trained with such esteemed director/writers as James Lapine (\"Twelve Dreams\" at Lincoln Center with Donna Murphy), Tony Kushner (\"Slavs!\" at New York Theater Workshop with Marisa Tomei), and Naomi Wallace (\"One Flea Spare\" at the Public Theatre with Dianne Wiest), she went on to work side by side with modern-day screen icons including Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant on Notting Hill (1999), Bruce Willis and Toni Collette on The Sixth Sense (1999) and Sam Rockwell in her Sundance critically-lauded feature film debut Lawn Dogs (1997) produced by Duncan Kenworthy in 1998. Yet, despite this early success in theater and film, what really catapulted Mischa to the next level and made her a household name is her small screen performance as the irrepressible and irresistible \"Marisa\" on the popular Fox television show, The O.C. (2003) (2003 to 2007). The show fast became a global cult phenomenon and has earned many awards including a Television Critics Association Award nomination for \"Outstanding New Program of the Year\". Established as one of the most sought after young actresses of her generation Mischa was named \"It Girl\" by Entertainment Weekly, she was also Hollywood Life's \"Breakthrough Actress of the Year\", she won several American Teen Choice Awards for the show, and also Cosmopolitan's \"Fun Fearless Female Award\" for \"Knockout Ingenue\" and Glamour's \"Women of the Year\". She has been ranked as one of People magazine's \"50 Most Beautiful People\" for 5 consecutive years. She was awarded the VIPer Award in 2008 for \"Style Icon 2007\" by Mr. Karl Lagerfeld. In 2008, she played opposite Shirley MacLaine & Christopher Plummer in Sir Richard Attenborough's Closing the Ring (2007), with Hayden Christensen in the Dino De Laurentiis film Medieval pie - Territoires vierges (2007), and starred opposite Bruce Willis in Assassination of a High School President (2008) for the Yari Production Company. In 2007, she filmed Walled In (2009) for the French production company \"Canal Plus\", and she starred in and produced the film Homecoming (2009). In 2012 Mischa went back to her Theatrical roots and starred in a production of \"Steel Magnolias\" at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin. Mischa has the following Films slated for release this year, 2013. \"Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain\" opposite Martin Sheen, \"A Resurrection\" starring the late Michael Clarke Duncan and Devon Sawa \"Apartment 1303 3D\" with Rebecca De Mornay, \"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\" opposite Ryan Eggold and \"Beauty and the Least: The Misadventures of Ben Banks\". She has just completed \"Mining for Ruby\" Directed by Zoe Quist, \"Beyond Justice\" with Danny Trejo and Vinnie Jones and will star opposite Billy Zane in \"Elephant's Graveyard\" and with Christopher Plummer and Timothy Hutton in \"Butterfly Love\" 2014. Mischa has also made a major impression in the fashion and beauty world. She has already graced the covers of countless international magazines and has become the face of numerous advertising campaigns. She has developed her own Brand, her successful Handbag line having launched in 2008, together with Accessories, Clothing and Beauty products and her Flagship Boutique opened in Fashionable Shoreditch London in 2012. This commercial and theatrical success has given the young woman an opportunity to take an extremely influential role in the global community. She became the spokesperson for \"Climate Star\", an organization that fights global warming through social and legislative activism. She serves as an \"Entertainment Industry Foundation\" ambassador teaming up with QVC to spread awareness and raise funds for women's cancer research through the \"Fashion Footwear Association\" of New York \"Shoes on Sale Initiative\" and is also involved in the \"SAFE\" campaign for skin cancer awareness.

Developing many works at the legendary Actors Studio in New York where she is a lifetime member and serves on its board of directors, Angelica mounted Eugene O'Neill's classic \"Anna Christie\" and tackled the title role under the direction of Tony nominated Wilson Milam. Sold out exclusive engagements of the first workshop hailed as \"magnificent\" by Cindy Adams, in New York and Los Angeles have preceded the highly anticipated full production slated for 2013. The award winning solo play \"Edge\" garnered her an Outer Critics Circle Nomination (Best Solo Performance 2003) and has enjoyed critically acclaimed runs in New Zealand, Australia, Texas, Miami (New Times Award Best Actress 2005) and Los Angeles after its triumphant, sold-out run in London. Angelica received The Helen Hayes Award (Best Actress 2000) for assuming the lead role in the Tony Award-winning \"Sideman\" at Kennedy Center. This followed closely after being honored with the New York People's Choice Award in the Best Supporting Actress category (1999) for her portrayal of Patsy, a role she originated for the same production. Nominated for her second Helen Hayes Award (Best Actress 2010) for her critically praised portrayal of Ivy Weston in the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning \"August:Osage County\" (1st National Broadway Tour), Angelica's performance was heralded as \"revelatory\" by the Chicago Tribune when landing in the Steppenwolf production's home turf. In television, Angelica has made her mark by playing sympathetic tragic figures with seemingly effortless ease as in her role as Julia Brinn in \"Law and Order Special Victim Unit \"(2005). Her final confession was filmed in one take. Her numerous other television credits include \"Law and Order\", \"Criminal Intent\", \"The Sopranos\", \"100 Centre Street\", \"In The Line of Fire, D.C.\", \"As The World Turns\", \"Songs In Ordinary Time\" (CBS), \"Ruby's Bucket of Blood\" (Showtime) and \"Talk To Me\" (TNT). The films Angelica has appeared in have unceasingly stretched her character work as well as her leading lady capacity. In her first film appearance in Robert Benton's \"Nobody's Fool\" (1994), Angelica played opposite Paul Newman in her cameo as Ruby. Leads, supporting leads and cameos followed as she balanced her dedication to her stagecraft with screen work. \"The Sixth Sense\" proved one of the most notable cameos with a screen time of only two minutes for her performance as the emotionally barren Mrs. Collins - a role that has captured the imagination of a generation. Supporting roles include the Polish stuttering prostitute Vitka in Amos Kolleck's \"Fast Food Fast Women\" (2000), the fame hungry waitress Dierdre in the Oscar-nominated \"The Contender\" (2000), smoldering grifter Patty opposite John Travolta in \"Domestic Disturbance\" (2001), and the lust-filled youth hunting Roberta in Michael Imperioli's \"The Hungry Ghosts\" (2009). \"The Mouse\" (1996) opposite John Savage and recently released \"Mint Julep\" (2010), also starring David Morse and James Gandolfini, and \"Lucky Days\" (2010) have secured Angelica's reputation as a transformational force that captures the hearts and minds of directors, critics and filmgoers everywhere. From mousy housewife to mercurial manipulator to love torn virgin, these film roles illuminate her unfathomable versatility and bottomless capacity for emotional depth. \"Lucky Days\" marks Angelica's first film produced by her film company. She wrote, co-directed and stars in this debut. Angelica Page who most recently starred on Broadway in \"The Best Man\", is currently developing \"Turning Page\", a new play about her mother, the legendary Geraldine Page which began in development at the Actors' Studio before moving to its exploratory Off Broadway run at The Cherry Lane Theatre. Angelica has also dedicated herself to a book and documentary about her mother to be completed this year. Angelica Page is a lifetime member of the Actors Studio and serves on its board of directors. She is actively involved raising funds for the charities PAVE and The Trevor Project through Musical Momentum, and is developing a foundation for the arts to foster emerging artists.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5OTQ5MjMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDIxNTM5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868125","name":"Angelica Page","nicknames":["Angel","Gagalina","Gaga"],"idIMDB":"nm0868125"},"actorId":"nm0868125","character":"Mrs. Collins","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219304","main":true},{"actorName":"Lisa Summerour","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838655","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NTM5NDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMyMzY4ODE@._V1_UY44_CR11,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Lisa Summerour is an actress, known for The Sixth Sense (1999), Philadelphia (1993) and Mercury Rising (1998).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NTM5NDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMyMzY4ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838655","name":"Lisa Summerour","idIMDB":"nm0838655"},"actorId":"nm0838655","character":"Bridesmaid","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219306","main":true},{"actorName":"Firdous Bamji","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051479","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MDU3ODA2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzMDE0Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR18,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 May 1966","placeOfBirth":" Bombay, India","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Firdous Bamji was born in Bombay and grew up in Bahrain, Kodaikanal (South India) and Columbia, South Carolina.
