Lawrence was born Jennifer Shrader Lawrence on August 15, 1990 in Louisville, Kentucky, to Karen (Koch), who manages a children's camp, and Gary Lawrence, who works in construction. She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and has English, German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Her career began when she traveled to Manhattan at the age of fourteen. After conducting her first cold read, agents told her mother that \"it was the best cold read by a 14- year-old they had ever heard\", and tried to convince her stage mother that she needed to spend the summer in Manhattan. After leaving the agency, Jen was spotted by an agent in the midst of shooting an H&M ad and asked to take her picture. The next day, that agent followed up with her and invited her to the studio for a cold read audition. Again, the agents were highly impressed and strongly urged her mother to allow her to spend the summer in New York City. As fate would have it, she did, and subsequently appeared in commercials such as MTV's \"My Super Sweet 16\" and played a role in the movie, The Devil You Know (2013). Shortly thereafter, her career forced her and her family to move to Los Angeles, where she was cast in the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show (2007), and in smaller movies like The Poker House (2008) and The Burning Plain (2008). Her big break came when she played Ree in Winter's Bone (2010), which landed her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. Shortly thereafter, she secured the role of Mystique in franchise reboot X-Men: First Class (2011), which went on to be a hit in Summer 2011. Around this time, Lawrence scored the role of a lifetime when she was cast as Katniss Everdeen in the big-screen adaptation of literary sensation The Hunger Games (2012). The film went on to become one of the highest-grossing movies ever with over $407 million at the domestic box office, and instantly propelled Lawrence to the A-list among young actors/actresses. Three Hunger Games sequels were released in each consecutive November, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014), and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015), with Lawrence reprising her role. In 2012, the romantic comedy, Silver Linings Playbook earned her the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Satellite Award and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress, among other accolades, making her the youngest person ever to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actress and the second-youngest Best Actress winner. She starred in David O. Russell's popular drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), as Roselyn Rosenfield, and teamed with the director again to play inventor Joy Mangano in another family comedy, Joy (2015), receiving Oscar nominations for both roles (Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress, respectively).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxNzc4MDU1MjBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDk5Nzg3MTgx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2225369","name":"Jennifer Lawrence","nicknames":["Jen","JLaw"],"idIMDB":"nm2225369"},"actorId":"nm2225369","character":"Katniss Everdeen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0242701","main":true},{"actorName":"Liam Hemsworth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2955013","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODI0MDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM5MDk3MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 January 1990","placeOfBirth":" Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Liam Hemsworth was born on January 13, 1990, in Melbourne, Australia, and is the younger brother of actors Chris Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth. He is the son of Leonie (van Os), a teacher of English, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counselor. He is of Dutch (from his immigrant maternal grandfather), Irish, English, Scottish, and German ancestry. His uncle, by marriage, was Rod Ansell, the bushman who inspired the film Crocodile Dundee (1986). The Hemsworth family lived primarily on Phillip Island, a small island located south of Melbourne. Following in the footsteps of his older brothers, who went into acting in their teens, Liam scored his first audition at age 16 and appeared on the Australian TV series Summer Bay (1988) and McLeod's Daughters (2001) before taking on a recurring character role on the soap opera Les voisins (1985), in which his brother Luke had also appeared. Roles on TV shows Son Altesse Alex (2008) and Satisfaction (2007) followed before Liam moved to the United States to pursue a big-screen career. After suffering two setbacks - his character was written out of the script for The Expendables (2010) days before filming and he lost the title role of Thor (2011) to his brother Chris - Liam was cast opposite Miley Cyrus in the Nicholas Sparks drama The Last Song (2010). The two, who played love interests in the film, soon started dating, and Liam appeared in Cyrus' music video \"When I Look at You.\" Following that film's modest commercial success, and the attendant press coverage of his rising career and high-profile romance, he was almost immediately thrust into leading man status, and was cast as Gale Hawthorne in the big-screen adaptation of the best-selling novel The Hunger Games (2012). Following the blockbuster success of that film, Liam nabbed a number of roles, including a supporting part in The Expendables 2 (2012) and leading roles in the war drama Love and Honor (2013), the crime drama Empire State (2013), and the thriller Paranoia (2013). He will also star as Ali Baba in a 3D production of Arabian Nights and will reprise the role of Gale Hawthorne in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). Hemsworth was engaged to Miley Cyrus from June 2012 to September 2013.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODI0MDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM5MDk3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2955013","name":"Liam Hemsworth","idIMDB":"nm2955013"},"actorId":"nm2955013","character":"Gale Hawthorne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0244190","main":true},{"actorName":"Jack Quaid","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4425051","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTkwODEzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg0ODA2OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 April 1992","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Jack Henry Quaid","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Jack Quaid was born on April 24, 1992 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Jack Henry Quaid.

He grew up in Lebanon, Ohio, and, after receiving degrees in theater arts and English from Hanover College, had a brief stint in New York theater. He was soon cast as Woody on TV series Cheers (1982), which wound up being one of the most-popular TV shows ever and also earned Harrelson an Emmy for his performance in 1989. While he dabbled in film during his time on Cheers (1982), that area of his career didn't fully take off until towards the end of the show's run. In 1991, Doc Hollywood (1991) gave him his first widely-seen movie role, and he followed that up with White Men Can't Jump (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993) and Natural Born Killers (1994). More recently, Harrelson was seen in No Country for Old Men (2007), Zombieland (2009), 2012 (2009), and Friends with Benefits (2011), along with the acclaimed HBO movie Game Change (2012). In 2011, Harrelson snagged the coveted role of fan-favorite drunk Haymitch Abernathy in the big-screen adaptation of The Hunger Games (2012), which ended up being one of the highest-grossing movies ever at the domestic box office. Harrelson is set to reprise that role for the sequels, which are scheduled for release in November 2013, 2014 and 2015. Harrelson has received two Academy Award nominations, first for his role as controversial Hustler founder Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and then for a role in The Messenger (2009). He also received Golden Globe nominations for both of these parts. In 2016, he had a stand-out role as a wise teacher in the teen drama The Edge of Seventeen (2016). Harrelson was briefly married to Nancy Simon in the 80s, and later married his former assistant, Laura Louie, with whom he has three daughters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NDc2ODc4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2MzAyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000437","name":"Woody Harrelson","idIMDB":"nm0000437"},"actorId":"nm0000437","character":"Haymitch Abernathy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0247356","main":true},{"actorName":"Josh Hutcherson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1242688","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4OTk0MjQ1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE3NjM3Mw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 October 1992","placeOfBirth":" Union, Kentucky, USA","birthName":"Joshua Ryan Hutcherson","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Joshua Ryan Hutcherson was born on October 12, 1992 in Union, Kentucky to Michelle Fightmaster Hutcherson, who worked for Delta Air Lines, and Chris Hutcherson, an EPA analyst. He has one younger brother, Connor Hutcherson. From the age of four, Josh knew that he wanted to be an actor. In order to pursue his goal, Josh and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was nine-years-old. In 2002, Josh landed his first acting role in the TV film, House Blend (2002), with Amy Yasbeck, Dan Cortese and Sean Faris. The same year, Josh was cast in the pilot, Becoming Glen (2002), but Fox did not order it to series (though, several years later, it was reconfigured as the short-lived series, The Winner (2007), starring Rob Corddry, and co-written/produced by Seth MacFarlane). Toward the end of 2002, Josh appeared on an episode of ER (1994). Josh made his big-screen debut, in 2003, with a bit part in the Oscar-nominated American Splendor (2003). His career began its measured ascent in 2005 with a supporting slot as one of Will Ferrell's kids in Kicking & Screaming (2005), a co-starring role in the indie hit Little Manhattan (2005), and another co-starring role in Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), which was originally conceived as a sequel to Jumanji (1995). Despite underperforming at the box office, \"Zathura\" helped earned for Josh his first Young Artist Award for \"Leading Young Actor\". 2006 saw bigger returns for Josh's burgeoning film career with a role as one of Robin Williams' sons in the modest hit, RV (2006). The following year, he landed his first breakthrough role in Bridge to Terabithia (2007), the kid-approved adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel that co-starred AnnaSophia Robb, whose career was also taking off at this time. Josh starred as Brendan Fraser's nephew in another family-film hit, Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008), and he had a smaller role in the Crash-like drama, Fragments (2008), though by now his face and name were being used in movie-marketing materials. Though it wasn't a hit, Josh's character in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant (2009) served as a major plot device early in the story. In 2010, Josh co-starred in the critically-acclaimed film, The Kids Are All Right (2010), alongside Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, and Mia Wasikowska. The film received several awards and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Josh's performance as the youngest child in a family, led by two mothers, earned him acclaim from audiences and the industry, alike. Josh followed up with an expanded role in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012), which saw Dwayne Johnson take over as the main character from Brendan Fraser. Between the star power and the allure of 3D, the sequel was a worldwide hit and a third installment is in development. With the announcement that he would portray the beloved \"Peeta Mellark\" in The Hunger Games (2012), the film adaptation of the best-selling novel written by Suzanne Collins, Josh became an instant celebrity. In the wake of the movie's massive worldwide success, Detention (2011), a horror/comedy that Josh made before \"The Hunger Games\", was released. Josh was also an executive producer on that feature. Before Josh reprises his role as \"Peeta\" in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), we will see him in the long-delayed remake of Red Dawn (2012); the omnibus 7 jours à la Havane (2012) (aka \"7 Days in Havana\") (Josh's segment was directed by Benicio Del Toro); The Forger (2012) opposite Lauren Bacall, Alfred Molina, and Hayden Panettiere; and the animated Epic (2013) from Ice Age (2002) co-director (and voice of \"Scrat\"), Chris Wedge.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4OTk0MjQ1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE3NjM3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1242688","name":"Josh Hutcherson","nicknames":["JHutch","Hutch"],"idIMDB":"nm1242688"},"actorId":"nm1242688","character":"Peeta Mellark","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0239974","main":true},{"actorName":"Paula Malcomson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0539155","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxODQyNzEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU1NDMwNQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1970","placeOfBirth":" Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Born in 1970 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Paula Malcomson is an extremely prolific film and television actress with numerous credits to her name.

He has appeared in almost 200 different shows and films. He is also the father of renowned actor Kiefer Sutherland, among others. Donald McNichol Sutherland was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, to Dorothy Isobel (McNichol) and Frederick McLea Sutherland, who worked in sales and electricity. He has Scottish, as well as German and English, ancestry. Sutherland worked several different jobs - he was a radio DJ in his youth - and was almost set on becoming an engineer after graduating from the University of Toronto with a degree in engineering. However, he also graduated with a degree in drama, and he chose to abandon becoming an engineer in favour of an actor. Sutherland's first roles were bit parts and consisted of such films as the horror film Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965) which starred Christopher Lee. He was also appearing in episodes of TV shows such as \"The Saint\" and \"Court Martial\". Sutherland's break would come soon, though, and it would come in the form of a war film in which he was barely cast. The reason he was barely cast was because he had been a last-minute replacement for an actor that had dropped out of the film. The role he played was that of the dopey but loyal Vernon Pinkley in the war film The Dirty Dozen (1967). The film also starred Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, and Telly Savalas. The picture was an instant success as an action/war film, and Sutherland played upon this success by taking another role in a war film: this was, however, a comedy called MASH (1970) which landed Sutherland the starring role alongside Elliott Gould and Tom Skerritt. This is now considered a classic among film goers, and the 35-year old actor was only getting warmed up. Sutherland took a number of other roles in between these two films, such as the theatrical adaptation Oedipus the King (1968), the musical Joanna (1968) and the Clint Eastwood-helmed war comedy Kelly's Heroes (1970). It was Kelly's Heroes (1970) that became more well-known, and it reunited Sutherland with Telly Savalas. 1970 and 1971 offered Sutherland a number of other films, the best of them would have to be Klute (1971). The film, which made Jane Fonda a star, is about a prostitute whose friend is mysteriously murdered. Sutherland received no critical acclaim like his co-star Fonda (she won an Oscar) but his career did not fade. Moving on from Klute (1971), Sutherland landed roles such as the lead in the thriller Lady Ice (1973), and another lead in the western Alien Thunder (1974). These films did not match up to \"Klute\"'s success, though Sutherland took a supporting role that would become one of his most infamous and most critically acclaimed. He played the role of the murderous fascist leader in the Bernardo Bertolucci Italian epic 1900 (1976). Sutherland also gained another memorable role as a marijuana-smoking university professor in Animal House (1978) among other work that he did in this time. Another classic role came in the form of the Robert Redford film, Ordinary People (1980). Sutherland portrays an older father figure who must deal with his children in an emotional drama of a film. It won Best Picture, and while both the supporting stars were nominated for Oscars, Sutherland once again did not receive any Academy Award nomination. He moved on to play a Nazi spy in a film based on Ken Follett's book \"Eye of the Needle\" and he would star alongside Al Pacino in the commercial and critical disaster that was Revolution (1985). While it drove Al Pacino out of films for four years, Sutherland continued to find work. This work led to the dramatic, well-told story of apartheid A Dry White Season (1989) alongside the legendary actor Marlon Brando. Sutherland's next big success came in the Oliver Stone film JFK (1991) where Sutherland plays the chilling role of Mister X, an anonymous source who gives crucial information about the politics surrounding President Kennedy. Once again, he was passed over at the Oscars, though Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for his performance as Clay Shaw. Sutherland went on to appear in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), Shadow of the Wolf (1992), and Disclosure (1994). The new millennium provided an interesting turn in Sutherland's career: reuniting with such former collaborators as Clint Eastwood and Tommy Lee Jones, Sutherland starred in Space Cowboys (2000). He also appeared as the father figure to Nicole Kidman's character in Cold Mountain (2003) and Charlize Theron's character in The Italian Job (2003). He has also made a fascinating, Oscar-worthy performance as the revolutionist Mr. Thorne in Land of the Blind (2006) and also as a judge in Reign Over Me (2007). Recently, he has joined forces with his son Rossif Sutherland and Canadian comic [error] with the new comedy The Con Artist (2010), as well as acting alongside Jamie Bell and Channing Tatum in the sword-and-sandal film The Eagle (2011). Sutherland has also taken a role in the remake of Charles Bronson's film The Mechanic (1972). Donald Sutherland has made a lasting legacy on Hollywood, whether portraying a chilling and horrifying villain, or playing the older respectable character in his films. A true character actor, Sutherland is one of Canada's most well-known names and will hopefully continue on being so long after his time.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MDI1NzcyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0MjQwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661","name":"Donald Sutherland","idIMDB":"nm0000661"},"actorId":"nm0000661","character":"President Snow","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0249367","main":true},{"actorName":"Elizabeth Banks","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006969","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMTcxNDU3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0MzEzNw@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 February 1974","placeOfBirth":" Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Elizabeth Maresal Mitchell","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Elizabeth Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, a small city in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts near the New York border, on February 10, 1974. She is the daughter of Ann (Wallace), who worked in a bank, and Mark P. Mitchell, a factory worker. Elizabeth describes herself as having been seen as a \"goody two-shoes\" in her youth who was nominated for the local Harvest Queen. Banks left home to attend college at the University of Pennsylvania--from which she graduated Magna cum Laude--and went on to attend the Advanced Training Program at the prestigious American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, graduating in 1996. She then moved to New York and worked in the theater, and began getting small roles in films and on television. Seeking more screen work, she moved to Los Angeles and was soon cast in supporting roles. She also had to change her last name, to Banks, in order to avoid confusion with actress Elizabeth Mitchell. Her breakthrough role was as Betty Brant, the secretary of the cantankerous newspaper tycoon in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). She followed up this performance with small roles in other movies: Swept Away (2002), Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002), Seabiscuit (2003) and The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). In 2003 she won the Exciting New Face Award at the Young Hollywood Awards. The winsome, beautiful Banks projected an exceptionally charming screen presence that drew comparisons to Audrey Hepburn, and Hollywood eventually began to take notice, Banks being cast in the lead in such films as Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) and in Oliver Stone's biopic of George W. Bush, W. (2008), as Laura Bush. In television Banks was a recurring guest star on Scrubs (2001) as Dr. Kim Briggs, the love interest of Zach Braff's J.D. In 2010 she was cast as Alec Baldwin's love interest in season four of 30 Rock (2006). Originally scheduled to appear in only four episodes, she was brought back as a recurring character for two more seasons, and earned Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for two consecutive years. Banks has more recently appeared in such films as Our Idiot Brother (2011), Man on a Ledge (2012), What to Expect When You're Expecting (2012), People Like Us (2012), and Pitch Perfect (2012). She also won the coveted role as Effie Trinket in The Hunger Games (2012) and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). Banks married Max Handelman, a sports writer and producer, in 2003. They have two sons, Felix, who was born in March 2011, and Magnus, born in Nov. 2012, both by gestational surrogacy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMTcxNDU3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0MzEzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006969","name":"Elizabeth Banks","idIMDB":"nm0006969"},"actorId":"nm0006969","character":"Effie Trinket","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0245505","main":true},{"actorName":"Bruce Bundy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4190172","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMTM3ODc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5NTU2MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Bruce Bundy is an actress and producer, known for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), The Hunger Games (2012) and The Greggs (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMTM3ODc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5NTU2MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4190172","name":"Bruce Bundy","idIMDB":"nm4190172"},"actorId":"nm4190172","character":"Octavia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0251092","main":true},{"actorName":"Nelson Ascencio","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038458","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIxNDczMTEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5MTMwOTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 August 1964","placeOfBirth":" Cuba","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Nelson Ascencio is an Actor/Writer best known for his time on MADtv, as well as appearances on Curb Your Enthusiasm, Paul and most recently The Hunger Games franchise as Flavius.

The family moved to California when Lenny was ten. His father was Jewish and his mother was of African-American and Afro-Bahamian ancestry. He started playing the drums and guitar at the age of five, influenced by his parents' love of R&B, jazz, classical, opera and blues. In Los Angeles, his mother encouraged him to join the California Boys Choir and Metropolitan Choir. He attended Beverly Hills High School, where he was a contemporary of Slash from Guns N' Roses, graduating in 1982. In the late 1980s he returned to New York to pursue his musical career. Here he met and married Lisa Bonet, who played Denise Huxtable on The Cosby Show (1984). They had one child together, a daughter Zoe, but would divorce in 1993. Kravitz signed to Virgin in 1989, releasing his debut album \"Let Love Rule\" that same year. Just like one of his major early influences, Prince, Kravitz played nearly all the instruments on the album. \"Let Love Rule\" met mixed critical reviews; his second album, \"Mama Said\", released two years later, provided him with his major breakthrough. It reached the top 40 of the Billboard album chart, while the single \"It Ain't Over Til It's Over\" (influenced by his break up with Bonet) reached #2 in the singles charts. His third album \"Are You Gonna Go My Way\", released in 1994, earned a BRIT award for best international male artist. Following the release of \"5\" in 1998 and the single \"Fly Away\", Kravitz won the first of four Grammys for Best Male Vocal Rock Performance. He has also co-written and produced material for various artists such as Madonna, Vanessa Paradis, and Steven Tyler as well as performing on tracks for Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Jay Z. While probably best known for his musical career, Kravitz has appeared in a number of movies, most notably his screen debut Precious (2009) and most recently The Hunger Games (2012), in which he played the role of Cinna, the soft-spoken designer who turns Katniss Everdeen Jennifer Lawrence into a star. Kravitz had a supporting role in Precious (2009) director Lee Daniels' film, Lee Daniels' The Butler (2013), and reprised his role as Cinna in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgxMzUwMTI2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA4MDg1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005107","name":"Lenny Kravitz","idIMDB":"nm0005107"},"actorId":"nm0005107","character":"Cinna","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0249078","main":true},{"actorName":"Stanley Tucci","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001804","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MzE4MjAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA2MTMyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 November 1960","placeOfBirth":" Peekskill, New York, USA","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Actor Stanley Tucci was born on November 11, 1960, in Peekskill, New York. He is the son of Joan (Tropiano), a writer, and Stanley Tucci, an art teacher. His family is Italian-American, with origins in Calabria.

He began his professional career on the stage, making his Broadway debut in 1982, and then made his film debut in Prizzi's Honor (1985). In 2009, Tucci received his first Academy Award nomination for his turn as a child murderer in The Lovely Bones (2009). He also received a BAFTA nomination and a Golden Globe nomination for the same role. Other than The Lovely Bones, Tucci has recently had noteworthy supporting turns in a broad range of movies including Lucky Number Slevin (2006), The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Tucci reached his widest audience yet when he played Caesar Flickerman in box office sensation The Hunger Games (2012). While maintaining an active career in movies, Tucci received major accolades for some work in television. He won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his role in TV movie Winchell (1998), an Emmy for a guest turn on Monk (2002), and a Golden Globe for his role in HBO movie Conspiracy (2001).
