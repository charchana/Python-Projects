Her mother, Helga Bullock (née Helga Mathilde Meyer), was a German opera singer. Her father, John W. Bullock, was an American voice teacher, who was born in Alabama, of Irish, English, French, and German descent. Sandra grew up on the road with her parents and younger sister, chef Gesine Bullock-Prado, and spent much of her childhood in Nuremberg, Germany. She often performed in the children's chorus of whatever production her mother was in. That singing talent later came in handy for her role as an aspiring country singer in The Thing Called Love (1993). Her family moved back to the Washington area when she was adolescent. She later enrolled in East Carolina University in North Carolina, where she studied acting. Shortly afterward she moved to New York to pursue a career on the stage. This led to acting in television programs and then feature films. She gave memorable performances in Demolition Man (1993) and Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993), but did not achieve the stardom that seemed inevitable for her until her work in the smash hit Speed (1994). She now ranks as one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. For her role in The Blind Side (2009) she won the Oscar, and her blockbusters The Proposal (2009), The Heat (2013) and Gravity (2013) made her a bankable star. With $56,000,000, she was listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the highest-paid actress in the world.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NDY5NjU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ0MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113","name":"Sandra Bullock","nicknames":["Sandy","America's Sweetheart","The Girl Next Door"],"idIMDB":"nm0000113"},"actorId":"nm0000113","character":"Margaret Tate","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0127729","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryan Reynolds","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI3ODk1MTMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyNTE2Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 October 1976","placeOfBirth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","birthName":"Ryan Rodney Reynolds","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Ryan Rodney Reynolds was born on October 23, 1976 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the youngest of four children. His father, James Chester Reynolds, was a food wholesaler, and his mother, Tammy, worked as a retail-store saleswoman. Between 1991-93, Ryan appeared in Fifteen (1990), a Nickleodeon series taped in Florida with many other Canadian actors. After the series ended, he returned to Vancouver where he played in a series of forgettable television movies. He did small roles in Glenn Close's Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (1995) and CBS's update of In Cold Blood (1996). However, his run of luck had led him to decide to quit acting. One night, he ran into fellow Vancouver actor and native Chris William Martin. Martin found Ryan rather despondent and told him to pack everything: they were going to head to Los Angeles, California. The two stayed in a cheap Los Angeles motel. On the first night of their stay, Reynolds' jeep was rolled downhill and stripped. For the next four months, Ryan drove it without doors. In 1997, he landed the role of Berg in Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998). Initially, the show was reviled by critics and seemed desperate for any type of ratings success. However, it was renewed for a second season but with a provision for a makeover by former Roseanne (1988) writer Kevin Abbott. The show became a minor success and has led to additional film roles for Ryan, most notably in the last-ever MGM film, a remake of The Amityville Horror (2005). Ryan was engaged to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, another Nickelodeon veteran, between 2004-2006. He has been married to Blake Lively since September 9, 2012. They have two children. He was previous married to Scarlett Johansson.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI3ODk1MTMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyNTE2Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351","name":"Ryan Reynolds","idIMDB":"nm0005351"},"actorId":"nm0005351","character":"Andrew Paxton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0093385","main":true},{"actorName":"Mary Steenburgen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005460","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OTI5OTc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc5NDMwNA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 February 1953","placeOfBirth":" Newport, Arkansas, USA","birthName":"Mary Nell Steenburgen","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Mary Steenburgen is an Academy Award-winning American actress. She was born February 8, 1953, in Newport, Arkansas, USA. Her mother, Nellie May (Wall) Steenburgen, was a school-board secretary, and her father, Maurice H. Steenburgen, was a freight-train conductor. Her surname comes from distant Dutch ancestry, and her roots also include English, Scottish, and Welsh. Young Steenburgen was fond of arts and literature. Mary grew up tap-dancing her way through talent shows and school functions. She was active in her school drama class. After appearing in a number of high school plays, she enrolled at Hendrix College, a highly progressive Southern School located in Conway, Arkansas. Upon the recommendation of her drama professor, she left college in 1972 and moved to New York to study acting professionally. In the past several years, Mary Steenburgen has emerged as one of the most accomplished and sought-after screen actresses. Ever since Jack Nicholson 'discovered' her and cast her as a sassy adventuress in his rollicking western, Goin' South (1978), her career has skyrocketed and she has won acclaim for exceptional performances in each of her diverse film roles. In Nicholas Meyer's Time After Time (1979), Steenburgen was afforded critical praise for her portrayal of a somewhat dippy but liberated young bank clerk in San Francisco who crosses paths, via time machine, with English author H.G. Wells (played by Malcolm McDowell, who later became her husband. In 1980 she shot to fame with her role as Lynda Dummar in Melvin and Howard (1980) for which she won Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. More recently, Steenburgen again impressed audiences and critics alike with her stunning performance as the strong-willed turn-of-the-century Mother in Ragtime (1981). Steenburgen is a notable patron of arts. She is also an active supporter of humanitarian causes. She has two children from her previous marriage to actor Malcolm McDowell. Since 1995 she has been married to actor Ted Danson, and the couple is living in Los Angeles area.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OTI5OTc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc5NDMwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005460","name":"Mary Steenburgen","idIMDB":"nm0005460"},"actorId":"nm0005460","character":"Grace Paxton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0130211","main":true},{"actorName":"Craig T.
