Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. His father is of English and Scottish descent, and his mother is of Finnish and Swedish ancestry. The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor Ben Affleck. Damon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, Rising Sun (1993), and prep-school drama, School Ties (1992). It was until his film, Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, Mystic Pizza (1988). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in School Ties (1992). Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, Courage Under Fire (1996). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for Good Will Hunting (1997), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. Good Will Hunting (1997) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with Ben Affleck. In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in Steven Spielberg's film, Saving Private Ryan (1998), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with Tom Hanks and Vin Diesel while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in Rounders (1998), starring opposite Edward Norton and John Malkovich. The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, Ben Affleck and fellow comedian, Chris Rock, in the comedy Dogma (1999). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played \"Tom Ripley\", a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow also starred in the movie. The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance. Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, Titan A.E. (2000) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, All the Pretty Horses (2000) and the golf comedy-drama, The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000), starring alongside Will Smith. In the year 2003, he signed on to star in The Informant! (2009) by Steven Soderbergh and the Farrelly Brothers' Stuck on You (2003). He also starred in Gerry (2002), a film he co-wrote with his friends, Gus Van Sant and Casey Affleck. One of Matt's most recognizable work to date is his role in the \"Bourne\" movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, \"Jason Bourne\", in The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). Another praised role is that as \"Linus Caldwell\" in the \"Ocean's\" movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle in Ocean's Eleven (2001). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm (2005), George Clooney's Syriana (2005), Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006) and Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd (2006). In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born Luciana Barroso, whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana's daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella. Matt is a big fan of the Boston Red Sox and he tries to attend their games whenever possible. He has also formed great friendships with his Ocean's co-stars, George Clooney and Brad Pitt, whom he works on charity projects with. He and actor Ben Affleck, together with Ben's wife, Jennifer Garner, are also good family friends and can be often seen going out together with Matt's wife.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NzYzNDgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354","name":"Matt Damon","idIMDB":"nm0000354"},"actorId":"nm0000354","character":"Rudy Baylor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014342","main":true},{"actorName":"Danny DeVito","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5MjM5MzM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTEzOTY0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 November 1944","placeOfBirth":" Asbury Park, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Daniel Michael DeVito Jr.","height":"4' 10\" (1.47 m)","bio":"Danny DeVito has amassed a formidable and versatile body of work as an actor, producer and director that spans the stage, television and film. Daniel Michael DeVito Jr. was born on November 17, 1944, in Neptune, New Jersey, to Italian-American parents. His mother, Julia (Moccello), was a homemaker. His father, Daniel, Sr., was a small business owner whose ventures included a dry cleaning shop, a dairy outlet, a diner, and a pool hall. While growing up in Asbury Park, his parents sent him to private schools. He attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel grammar school and Oratory Prep School. Following graduation in 1962, he took a job as a cosmetician at his sister's beauty salon. A year later, he enrolled at New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts so he could learn more about cosmetology. While at the academy, he fell in love with acting and decided to further pursue an acting career. During this time, he met another aspiring actor Michael Douglas at the National Playwrights Conference in Waterford, Connecticut. The two would later go on to collaborate on numerous projects. Soon after he also met an actress named Rhea Perlman. The two fell in love and moved in together. They were married in 1982 and had three children together. In 1968, Danny landed his first part in a movie when he appeared as a thug in the obscure Dreams of Glass (1970). Despite this minor triumph, Danny became discouraged with the film industry and decided to focus on stage productions. He made his Off-Broadway debut in 1969 in \"The Man With the Flower in His Mouth.\" He followed this up with stage roles in \"The Shrinking Bride,\" and \"Lady Liberty.\" In 1975, he was approached by director Milos Forman and Michael Douglas about appearing in the film version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), which would star Jack Nicholson in the leading role. With box office success almost guaranteed and a chance for national exposure, Danny agreed to the role. The movie became a huge hit, both critically and financially, and still ranks today as one the greatest movies of all time. Unfortunately, the movie did very little to help Danny's career. In the years following, he was relegated to small movie roles and guest appearances on television shows. His big break came in 1978 when he auditioned for a role on an ABC sitcom pilot called Taxi (1978), which centered around taxi cab drivers at a New York City garage. Danny auditioned for the role of dispatcher Louie DePalma. At the audition, the producers told Danny that he needed to show more attitude in order to get the part. He then slammed down the script and yelled, \"Who wrote this sh**?\" The producers, realizing he was perfect for the part, brought him on board. The show was a huge success, running from 1978 to 1983. Louie DePalma, played flawlessly by Danny, became one of the most memorable (and reviled) characters in television history. While he was universally hated by TV viewers, he was well-praised by critics, winning an Emmy award and being nominated three other times. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Danny maintained his status as a great character actor with memorable roles in movies like Romancing the Stone (1984), Ruthless People (1986), Throw Momma from the Train (1987) and Twins (1988). He also had a great deal of success behind the camera, directing movies like The War of the Roses (1989) and Hoffa (1992). In 1992, Danny was introduced to a new generation of moviegoers when he was given the role of The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot in Tim Burton's highly successful Batman Returns (1992). This earned him a nomination for Best Villain at the MTV Movie Awards. That same year, along with his then-wife Rhea Perlman, Danny co-founded Jersey Films, which has produced many popular films and TV shows, including Pulp Fiction (1994), Get Shorty (1995), Man on the Moon (1999) and Erin Brockovich (2000). DeVito has many directing credits to his name as well, including Throw Momma from the Train (1987), The War of the Roses (1989), Hoffa (1992), Death to Smoochy (2002) and the upcoming St. Sebastian. In 2006, he returned to series television in the FX comedy series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005). With a prominent role in a hit series, Devito's comic talents were now on display for a new generation of television viewers. In 2012, he provided the title voice role in Dr. Seuss' The Lorax (2012). These days, he continues to work with many of today's top talents as an actor, director and producer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5MjM5MzM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTEzOTY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362","name":"Danny DeVito","idIMDB":"nm0000362"},"actorId":"nm0000362","character":"Deck Shifflet","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0436936","main":true},{"actorName":"Claire Danes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000132","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMzQ1Mjk3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk3ODMxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1979","placeOfBirth":" Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Claire Catherine Danes","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"New Yorker Claire Catherine Danes was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Carla (Hall), a day-care provider and artist, and Christopher Danes, a computer consultant and photographer.

Always true to herself, she was able to earn Hollywood stardom on her own unglamorized terms. Born Muriel Teresa Wright in the Harlem district of New York City on October 27, 1918, her parents divorced when she was quite young and she lived with various relatives in New York and New Jersey. An uncle of hers was a stage actor. She attended the exclusive Rosehaven School in Tenafly, New Jersey. The acting bug revealed itself when she saw the legendary Helen Hayes perform in a production of \"Victoria Regina.\" After performing in school plays and graduating from Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey, she made the decision to pursue acting professionally. Apprenticing at the Wharf Theatre in Provincetown, Massachusetts during the summers of 1937 and 1938 in such plays as \"The Vinegar Tree\" and \"Susan and God\", she moved to New York and changed her name to Teresa after she discovered there was already a Muriel Wright in Actors Equity. Her first New York play was Thornton Wilder's \"Our Town\" wherein she played a small part but also understudied the lead ingénue role of Emily. She eventually replaced Martha Scott in the lead after the actress was escorted to Hollywood to make pictures and recreate the Emily role on film. It was during her year-long run in \"Life with Father\" that Teresa was seen by Goldwyn talent scouts, was tested, and ultimately won the coveted role of Alexandra in the film The Little Foxes (1941). She also accepted an MGM starlet contract on the condition that she not be forced to endure cheesecake publicity or photos for any type of promotion and could return to the theater at least once a year. Oscar-nominated for her work alongside fellow cast members Bette Davis (as calculating mother Regina) and Patricia Collinge (recreating her scene-stealing Broadway role as the flighty, dipsomaniac Aunt Birdie), Teresa's star rose even higher with her next pictures. Playing the good-hearted roles of the granddaughter in the war-era tearjerker Mrs. Miniver (1942) and baseball icon Lou Gehrig's altruistic wife in The Pride of the Yankees (1942) opposite Gary Cooper, the pretty newcomer won both \"Best Supporting Actress\" and \"Best Actress\" nods respectively in the same year, ultimately taking home the supporting trophy. Teresa's fourth huge picture in a row was Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and she even received top-billing over established star Joseph Cotten who played a murdering uncle to her suspecting niece. Wed to screenwriter Niven Busch in 1942, she had a slip with her fifth picture Casanova Brown (1944) but bounced right back as part of the ensemble cast in the \"Best Picture\" of the year The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) portraying the assuaging daughter of Fredric March and Myrna Loy who falls in love with damaged soldier-turned-civilian Dana Andrews. With that film, however, her MGM contract ended. Remarkably, she made only one movie for the studio (\"Mrs. Miniver\") during all that time. The rest were all loanouts. As a freelancing agent, the quality of her films began to dramatically decline. Pictures such as Enchantment (1948), Something to Live For (1952), California Conquest (1952), Count the Hours (1953), Track of the Cat (1954) and Escapade in Japan (1957) pretty much came and went. For her screenwriter husband she appeared in the above-average western thriller Pursued (1947) and crime drama The Capture (1950). Her most inspired films of that post-war era were The Men (1950) opposite film newcomer Marlon Brando and the lowbudgeted but intriguing The Search for Bridey Murphy (1956) which chronicled the fascinating story of an American housewife who claimed she lived a previous life. The \"Golden Age\" of TV was her salvation during these lean film years in which she appeared in fine form in a number of dramatic showcases. She recreated for TV the perennial holiday classic The 20th Century-Fox Hour: The Miracle on 34th Street (1955) in which she played the Maureen O'Hara role opposite Macdonald Carey and Thomas Mitchell. Divorced from Busch, the father of her two children, in 1952, Teresa made a concentrated effort to return to the stage and found consistency in such plays as \"Salt of the Earth\" (1952), \"Bell, Book and Candle\" (1953), \"The Country Girl\" (1953), \"The Heiress\" (1954), \"The Rainmaker\" (1955) and \"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs\" (1957) opposite Pat Hingle, in which she made a successful Broadway return. Marrying renowned playwright Robert Anderson in 1959, stage and TV continued to be her primary focuses, notably appearing under the theater lights in her husband's emotive drama \"I Never Sang for My Father\" in 1968. The couple lived on a farm in upstate New York until their divorce in 1978. By this time a mature actress now in her 50s, challenging stage work came in the form of \"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the Moon Marigolds\", \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\", \"Morning's at Seven\" and \"Ah, Wilderness!\" Teresa also graced the stage alongside George C. Scott's Willy Loman (as wife Linda) in an acclaimed presentation of \"Death of a Salesman\" in 1975, and appeared opposite Scott again in her very last play, \"On Borrowed Time\" (1991). After almost a decade away from films, she came back to play the touching role of an elderly landlady opposite Matt Damon in her last picture, John Grisham's The Rainmaker (1997). Teresa passed away of a heart attack in 2005.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDk5MDU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjg2MjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942863","name":"Teresa Wright","idIMDB":"nm0942863"},"actorId":"nm0942863","character":"Colleen 'Miss Birdie' Birdsong","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0436929","main":true},{"actorName":"Virginia Madsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000515","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUyMDcxNTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAwNjQzMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 September 1961","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"One of the hottest stars of the mid-1980s, Virginia Madsen has since played a variety of roles that have cemented her reputation as a fantastic actress who can adapt to any part. Virginia was born in Chicago, Illinois, and belongs to an acting family -- with her brother, Michael Madsen, also an actor, and her mother, Elaine Madsen (née Melson), an Emmy-winning writer, poet, and producer. Her paternal grandparents were Danish, and her father, Calvin Madsen, was a firefighter. Audiences first caught a glimpse of her as \"Princess Irulan\" in the 1984 science fiction epic Dune (1984). She followed that up with Electric Dreams (1984); however, it was in 1986 that Virginia captured the hearts of the audience with an intense portrayal of a Catholic school girl who fell in love with a boy from a prison camp in Duncan Gibbins' Fire with Fire (1986). Virginia played the role of \"Lisa\" and her co-star was Craig Sheffer, who played Lisa's love interest, \"Joe Fisk\". Kari Wuhrer also made an appearance as Virginia's best friend, \"Gloria\". Fire with Fire (1986) was a low-budget production, starring a bunch of fresh faces who were till then-unknown to Hollywood. However, the movie was a success and elevated its three young stars overnight. Virginia has never looked back since. Not only did she receive amazing reviews for her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated performance in Alexander Payne's hit film, Sideways (2004), but this Independent Spirit Award-winning actress has an illustrious resume of roles alongside the most notable and respected actors in the business. Also on Virginia's slate is her production company, with partner Karly Meola, called \"Title IX Productions\". Their first project was the documentary I Know a Woman Like That (2009), which previewed at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009 and premiered at the Chicago Film Festival in October 2009. The doc was directed by Virginia's mother, Elaine Madsen, about the lives of extraordinary women ages 64-94. Next in the company's lineup is the documentary Fighting Gravity (2010), about women ski jumpers' ongoing battle for the right to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Title IX will team up with \"Empire 8 Productions\" and Vancouver-based \"Screen Siren\" on the project. The duo also has several projects in development that they're shopping around for financing including screenwriters Sebastian Gutierrez's screen adaptation of Martha O'Connor's novel \"The Bitch Posse\" and a remake of the 1984 film Electric Dreams (1984), in which Virginia appeared.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUyMDcxNTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAwNjQzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000515","name":"Virginia Madsen","nicknames":["Gina"],"idIMDB":"nm0000515"},"actorId":"nm0000515","character":"Jackie Lemancyzk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0201644","main":true},{"actorName":"Mickey Rourke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MzYwNDA2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYzMjg4Mw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 September 1952","placeOfBirth":" Schenectady, New York, USA","birthName":"Philip Andre Rourke Jr.","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Mickey Rourke was born Phillip Andre Rourke, Jr. on September 16, 1952, in Schenectady, New York, the son of Annette (Cameron) and Phillip Andre Rourke. His father was of Irish and German descent, and his mother was of French-Canadian, English, and German ancestry. When he was six years old, his parents divorced. A year later, his mother married Eugene Addis, a Miami Beach police officer, and moved to Miami Shores, Florida. After graduating from Horace Mann Junior High School, Rourke's family moved to a house located on 47th Street and Prairie Avenue in Miami Beach. In 1969 Rourke attended Miami Beach Senior High School, where he played second-string first baseman under coach Skip Berkman. He also acted in a school play, \"The Serpent,\" directed by legendary \"Teacher To The Stars\" Jay W. Jensen. In 1971 he graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School, and after working for a short time as a bus boy at the famed Forge Restaurant on Miami Beach, Rourke moved back to New York to seek out a career in acting. Rourke's teenage years were more aimed toward sports more than acting. He took up self-defense training at the Boys Club of Miami. It was there he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career. At the age of 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as an 118-pound bantamweight, defeating Javier Villanueva. Some of his early matches were fought as Andre Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach,soon joining the Police Athletic League boxing program. In 1969 Rourke, now weighing 140 pounds, sparred with former World Welterweight champion Luis Rodriguez. Rodriguez was the number one-rated middleweight boxer in the world and was training for his match with world champion Nino Benvenuti. Rourke claims to have received a concussion in this sparring match. In 1971, at the Florida Golden Gloves, Rourke received another concussion from a boxing match. Doctors told him to take a year off and rest. In 1972 Rourke knocked out Ron Robinson in 18 seconds and John Carver in 39 seconds. On Aug. 20, 1973, Rourke knocked out 'Sherman \"Big Train\"' Bergman' in 31 seconds. Shortly after, Rourke decided to retire from amateur boxing. From 1964 to 1973, Rourke compiled an amateur boxing record of 27 wins (17 by knockout) and 3 defeats. At one point, he reportedly scored 12 consecutive first-round knockouts. As an amateur, Rourke had been friendly with pro-boxer Tommy Torino. When Rourke decided to return to boxing as a professional in 1991, Torino promoted some of Rourke's fights. Rourke was trained by former pro-boxer Freddie Roach at Miami Beach's 5th Street Gym and the Outlaw Boxing Club Gym in Los Angeles. He made $250 for his pro debut, but by the end of his second year of boxing, he had earned a million dollars. In June 1994, Rourke appeared on the cover of World Boxing Magazine. He sparred with world champions James Toney, John David Jackson, and Tommy Morrison. Rourke wished to have 16 professional fights and then fight for a world title. However, he retired in 1994 after eight bouts and never got his desired title fight. His boxing career resulted in severe facial injuries that required a number of operations to repair his damaged face. Rourke went back to acting but worked in relative obscurity until he won a Golden Globe Award for his role as Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson in The Wrestler (2008). He was nominated for Best Actor, as well, but lost.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MzYwNDA2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYzMjg4Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620","name":"Mickey Rourke","idIMDB":"nm0000620"},"actorId":"nm0000620","character":"Bruiser Stone","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0076115","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrew Shue","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0795576","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTcyMjI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDg4ODg0._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 February 1967","placeOfBirth":" South Orange, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Andrew Eppley Shue","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Andrew Shue was born on February 20, 1967 in South Orange, New Jersey, USA as Andrew Eppley Shue.

He first met Elvis in high school, where he was a year behind him. West played football for the Memphis Tigers high school football team, boxed in the Golden Gloves and played football for Jones Junior College playing center. West lived with his mother, Lois West, in the Hurt Housing project in Memphis. West became Elvis's personal driver in driving Elvis and band members Scotty Moore, Bill Black and later D.J. Fontana to different cities in the South for live appearances from 1955 to 1956. West served in the US Marine Corps from 1956 to late 1958 and was stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, which allowed him to stay in contact with Elvis. On August 14, 1958, West's estranged father, Newton Thomas West, died, the same day as Elvis' mother, Gladys Presley. After Elvis' discharge from the US Army in 1960, West was employed as one of Elvis' bodyguards. Over the years Elvis bought West a number of vehicles as he became a world-famous celebrity. West also became a movie stuntman and appeared in 16 of Elvis' films in the 1960s, usually playing extras or bit and supporting parts. West married one of Elvis' secretaries, Pat West, on July 1, 1961. A man of many talents, West became a songwriter for songs that Elvis, Pat Boone, Ricky Nelson and Johnny Rivers recorded, including the classic tune \"Separate Ways\" for Elvis, which won a BMI Award. In addition to the Elvis movies, West appeared in three Robert Conrad TV series The Wild Wild West (1965), Black Sheep Squadron (1976) and The Duke (1979). During the 1970s West, his cousin Del 'Sonny' West and 'Dave Hebler' served as Elvis' bodyguards, in charge of his daily transportation and, especially, in keeping weirdo, or potentially dangerous, fans away from him. On July 13, 1976, Vernon Presley, Elvis' father, fired West, Sonny West and Hebler after criticizing what he believed to be their heavy-handed tactics. The three of them collaborated on a book about their lives as Elvis' bodyguards, which was published just two weeks before Elvis' death in 1977. West has since continued his acting and songwriting careers.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1Nzk3NDc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk5OTMxNDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0922307","name":"Red West","idIMDB":"nm0922307"},"actorId":"nm0922307","character":"Buddy Black","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0436922","main":true},{"actorName":"Johnny Whitworth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0926615","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4Mjg5NDUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkyNTI1MDI@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 October 1975","placeOfBirth":" Charleston, South Carolina, USA","birthName":"Jonathan Lance Whitworth","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Johnny Whitworth is an American actor born in Charleston, SC on October 31, 1975. Whitworth grew up moving throughout the south before heading to Los Angeles at age 15 to pursue his acting career. Having appeared in over 40 film and television projects throughout his career, Whitworth has performed alongside some of Hollywood's most notable talents: Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro, Nicolas Cage, Idris Elba, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Matt Damon, Claire Danes, Danny DeVito, Mickey Rourke, Jon Voight, Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, in films such as Limitless (2011), Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011), 3:10 to Yuma (2007), Empire Records (1995), Gamer (2009) and Francis Ford Coppola's The Rainmaker (1997), to name a few. In the early 90s, he quickly achieved teen idol status after playing the wildly popular role of \"A.J.\" in the cult hit, Empire Records (1995). This came shortly after making one of his first acting debuts in the award winning television series, Party of Five (1994). Johnny also appeared, over a span of four years, in the beloved recurring role of \"Detective Jake Berkeley\" on the series CSI: Miami (2006-2010). He recently returned to prime time television in the role of \"Cage Wallace\" in Season Two of the popular series, _The 100_. This comes after completing work in early 2014 on the dramatic independent film, Bad Hurt (2015), with co-stars Karen Allen, Michael Harney and Theo Rossi. Bad Hurt is a family drama set in Staten Island, New York in the late 90's. Johnny portrays \"Kent Kendall\", a Gulf War Veteran suffering from PTSD among other elements, after returning home from an intense military combat tour. Bad Hurt (2015) was also selected to premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2015. Johnny has said \"that by the age of six, he knew he was going to be an actor\" and went on to define his craft through a series of formal training throughout his travels, while evolving as a professional actor. He has cultivated an impressive body of work, earning himself a number of TV and film credits, while demonstrating a highly versatile, professional dependability within the industry. Along the way, he was voted YM Magazine's 'Young and Modern Man' and has subsequently been featured in various entertainment publications throughout his career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4Mjg5NDUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkyNTI1MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0926615","name":"Johnny Whitworth","idIMDB":"nm0926615"},"actorId":"nm0926615","character":"Donny Ray Black","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0436925","main":true},{"actorName":"Wayne Emmons","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0256572","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1938","placeOfBirth":" Sheffield, Alabama, USA","birthName":"Anthony Wayne Emmons","bio":"Wayne Emmons was born in 1938 in Sheffield, Alabama, USA as Anthony Wayne Emmons.

Breaking that rule did him no harm, though, as he achieved pop cult status by finding, fighting and blowing up a 25-foot-long Great White shark (nicknamed \"Bruce\") in the mega-hit Jaws (1975) and then electrocuting an even bigger Great White in the vastly inferior Jaws 2 (1978). Athletic Scheider was born in November 1932 in Orange, New Jersey, to Anna (Crosson) and Roy Bernhard Scheider, a mechanic. He was of German and Irish descent. A keen sportsman from a young age, he competed in baseball and boxing (his awkwardly mended broken nose is a result of his foray into Golden Gloves competitions). While at college, his pursuits turned from sports to theater and he studied drama at Rutgers and Franklin and Marshall. After a stint in the military, Scheider appeared with the New York Shakespeare Festival and won an \"Obie Award\" for his appearance in the play \"Stephen D.\" His film career commenced with the campy Z-grade horror cheesefest The Curse of the Living Corpse (1964), and he then showed up in Star! (1968), Paper Lion (1968), Stiletto (1969) and Puzzle of a Downfall Child (1970). In 1971 he really came to the attention of film audiences with his role in the Jane Fonda thriller Klute (1971) and then as Det. Buddy Russo (scoring his first Oscar nomination) alongside fiery Gene Hackman in the crime drama The French Connection (1971). His performance as a tough street cop in that film led him into another tough cop role as NYC Det. Buddy Manucci in the underappreciated The Seven-Ups (1973), which features one of the best car chase sequences ever put on film. In the early 1970s the Peter Benchley novel \"Jaws\" was a phenomenal best-seller, and young director Steven Spielberg was chosen by Universal Pictures to direct the film adaptation, Jaws (1975), in which Scheider played police chief Brody and shared lead billing with Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss in the tale of a New England seaside community terrorized by a hungry Great White shark. \"Jaws\" was a blockbuster, and for many years held the record as the highest-grossing film of all time. Scheider then turned up as the shady CIA agent brother of Dustin Hoffman in the unnerving Marathon Man (1976) and in the misfired William Friedkin-directed remake of The Wages of Fear (1953) titled Sorcerer (1977), before again returning to Amity to battle another giant shark in Jaws 2 (1978). Seeking a change from tough cops and hungry sharks, he took the role of womanizing, drug-popping choreographer Joe Gideon, the lead character of the semi-autobiographical portrayal of director Bob Fosse in the sparkling All That Jazz (1979). It was another big hit for Scheider (and another Oscar nomination), with the film featuring a stunning opening sequence to the tune of the funky George Benson number \"On Broadway\", and breathtaking dance routines including the \"Airotica\" performance by the glamorous Sandahl Bergman. Returning to another law enforcement role, Scheider played a rebellious helicopter pilot in the John Badham conspiracy / action film Blue Thunder (1983), a scientist in the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) simply titled 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), a cheating husband who turns the tables on his blackmailers in 52 Pick-Up (1986), a cold-blooded hit man in Cohen and Tate (1988) and a CIA operative in the muddled and slow-moving The Russia House (1990). The versatile Scheider was then cast as the captain of a futuristic submarine in the relatively popular TV series SeaQuest 2032 (1993), which ran for three seasons. Inexplicably, however, Scheider had seemingly, and slowly, dropped out of favor with mainstream film audiences, and while he continued to remain busy, predominantly in supporting roles (generally as US presidents or military officers), most of the vehicles he appeared in were B-grade political thrillers such as État d'urgence (1997), Executive Target (1997), Chain of Command (2000) and Red Serpent (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODY5ODg4OTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDUzOTM3Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001702","name":"Roy Scheider","idIMDB":"nm0001702"},"actorId":"nm0001702","character":"Wilfred Keeley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0436934","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0119978","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119978","business":{"budget":{"money":"$40,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$10,626,507","country":"USA","day":"23","month":"11","year":"1997","remarks":"2,317 Screens"},{"money":"£339,465","country":"UK","day":"26","month":"04","year":"1998","remarks":"191 Screens"},{"money":"DEM 1,344,944","country":"Germany","day":"05","month":"04","year":"1998","remarks":"230 Screens"}],"gross":[{"money":"$45,856,732","country":"USA","day":"15","month":"03","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$45,786,014","country":"USA","day":"08","month":"03","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$45,656,703","country":"USA","day":"01","month":"03","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$45,405,439","country":"USA","day":"22","month":"02","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$45,066,594","country":"USA","day":"01","month":"02","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$45,011,537","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"01","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$44,948,423","country":"USA","day":"19","month":"01","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$44,771,567","country":"USA","day":"11","month":"01","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$44,417,226","country":"USA","day":"04","month":"01","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"$43,163,727","country":"USA","day":"28","month":"12","year":"1997","remarks":""},{"money":"$41,557,477","country":"USA","day":"21","month":"12","year":"1997","remarks":""},{"money":"$39,177,644","country":"USA","day":"14","month":"12","year":"1997","remarks":""},{"money":"$34,452,097","country":"USA","day":"07","month":"12","year":"1997","remarks":""},{"money":"$26,887,272","country":"USA","day":"30","month":"11","year":"1997","remarks":""},{"money":"$10,626,507","country":"USA","day":"23","month":"11","year":"1997","remarks":""},{"money":"£909,870","country":"UK","day":"17","month":"05","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"£823,492","country":"UK","day":"10","month":"05","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"£656,834","country":"UK","day":"03","month":"05","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"£339,465","country":"UK","day":"26","month":"04","year":"1998","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":[{"money":"£66,494","country":"UK","day":"10","month":"05","year":"1998","remarks":"126 Screens"},{"money":"£158,636","country":"UK","day":"03","month":"05","year":"1998","remarks":"189 Screens"},{"money":"£339,465","country":"UK","day":"26","month":"04","year":"1998","remarks":"191 Screens"}],"admissions":[{"money":"111,811","country":"Germany","day":"06","month":"04","year":"1998","remarks":""},{"money":"63,971","country":"Netherlands","day":"31","month":"12","year":"1999","remarks":""},{"money":"63,133","country":"Netherlands","day":"31","month":"12","year":"1998","remarks":""}],"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"07","month":"10","year":"1996","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"06","month":"02","year":"1997","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":"Copyright © MCMXCVII in United States and Canada by Mont Blanc Entertainment GMbH.
