After this experience Pozzetto worked for many important Italian directors. He made his debut in a leading role in 1974 in Flavio Mogherini's film To Love Ophelia (1974). His trademark is surreal and grotesque comedy with his characteristic awkward expression. Maybe his most brilliant performance was in _Da Grande (1987)_ which probably inspired _Big (1987)_, a film with Tom Hanks.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0694843","name":"Renato Pozzetto","idIMDB":"nm0694843"},"actorId":"nm0694843","character":"Piero","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Maddalena Crippa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187897","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1957","placeOfBirth":" Besana Brianza, Italy","bio":"Maddalena Crippa was born on September 4, 1957 in Besana Brianza, Italy.
