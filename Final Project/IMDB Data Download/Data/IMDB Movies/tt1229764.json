His SRO run as \"King Lear\" at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. received the best reviews any national leader has earned in that town for decades. Peter Marks of the Washington Post called Mr. Keach's Lear \"magnificent\". He recently accepted his third prestigious Helen Hayes Award for Leading Actor in 2010 for his stellar performance. His next stage appearance premiering January 13, 2011 at the Lincoln Center in New York is \"Other Desert Cities\" by Jon Robin Baitz and teaming him with Stockard Channing, Linda Lavin and Elizabeth Marvel. His latest television series, Lights Out (2011), on the FX network is a major new mid-season dramatic show, taking him back to the world of boxing which has been a rich setting for him before, notably in Huston's Fat City (1972) which ignited Keach's career as a film star. Versatility embodies the essence of Stacy Keach's career in film and television as well as on stage. The range of his roles is remarkable. His recent performance in Oliver Stone's \"W\" prompted fellow actor Alec Baldwin to blog an impromptu review matching Huston's amazement at Keach's power. Perhaps best known around the world for his portrayal of the hard-boiled detective, Mike Hammer, Stacy Keach is also well-known among younger generations for his portrayal of the irascible, hilarious Dad, Ken Titus, in the Fox sitcom, Titus, and more recently as Warden Henry Pope in the hit series, Prison Break. Following his triumphant recent title role performance in King Lear for the prestigious Goodman Theatre in Chicago, Keach joined the starring cast of John Sayles' recent film, Honeydripper. In the most recent of his non-stop activities, he has completed filming Deathmatch for the Spike Channel, and The Boxer for Zeitsprung Productions in Berlin, Germany. German audiences will also see him as one of the co-stars in the multi-million dollar production of Hindenburg: le géant des airs (2011), scheduled to air in January, 2011 with worldwide release thereafter. Mr. Keach co-stars in the new FX series entitled Lights Out (2011) about a boxing family, where he plays the Dad-trainer of two boxing sons played by Holt McCallany and Pablo Schreiber. The series is also scheduled to air in January, 2011. Keach returns to the New York stage at the start of the 2011 in Jon Robin Baitz's new play, \"Other Desert Cities,\" at the Lincoln Center. Capping his heralded accomplishment on the live stage of putting his own stamp on some of the theatre world's most revered and challenging roles over the past year when he headed the national touring company cast of \"Frost/Nixon,\" portraying Richard M. Nixon, bringing still another riveting characterization to the great legit stages of Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, the nation's capitol and other major cities. He won his second Best Actor Helen Hayes Award for his outstanding performance. His second triumphant portrayal of King Lear in the past three years, this time for the Shakespeare Theatre Company in the nation's capital earned reviews heard around the world, with resulting offers for him to repeat that giant accomplishment in New York, Los Angeles and even Beijing. An accomplished pianist and composer, Mr. Keach composed the music for the film, Imbued (2009), directed by Rob Nilssen, a celebrated film festival favorite, in which Keach also starred. He has also completed composing the music for the Mike Hammer audio radio series, \"Encore For Murder\", written by Max Collins, directed by Carl Amari, and produced by Blackstone Audio. Mr. Keach began his film career in the late 1960's with _The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter_, followed by _The New Centurions_ with George C. Scott; Doc Holiday with Faye Dunaway in the film 'Doc' (1971); an over-the-hill boxer,Billy Tully in Fat City (1972); directed by John Huston, and The Long Riders (1980), which he co-produced and co-wrote with his brother, James Keach, directed by Walter Hill. On the lighter side, his characterization of Sgt. Stedenko in Cheech and Chong's Up in Smoke (1978), and the sequel, Nice Dreams (1981), gave a whole new generation a taste of Mr. Keach's comedic flair, which he also demonstrated in Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud (1970), playing the oldest living lecherous Wright Brother; and The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972) where he played a crazed albino out to kill Paul Newman. Historical roles have always attracted him. In movies he has played roles ranging from Martin Luther to Frank James. On television he has been Napoleon, Wilbur Wright, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Barabbas, Sam Houston, and Ernest Hemingway, for which he won a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a mini-series and was nominated for an Emmy in the same category. He played an eccentric painter, Mistral, in the Judith Krantz classic, Mistral's Daughter (1984), a northern spy in the civil war special, The Blue and the Gray (1982), more recently as the pirate Benjamin Hornigold in the Hallmark epic Blackbeard (2006). As a director, his production of Arthur Miller's Incident at Vichy (1973) for PBS was, according to Mr. Miller in his autobiography, Timebends, \"the most expressive production of that play he had seen.\" He won a Cine Golden Eagle Award for his work on the dramatic documentary, The Repeater, in which he starred and also wrote and directed. But it is perhaps the live theatre where Mr. Keach shines brightest. He began his professional career with the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1964, doubling as Marcellus and the Player King in a production of Hamlet directed by Joseph Papp and which featured Julie Harris as Ophelia. He rose to prominence in 1967 in the Off-Broadway political satire, MacBird, where the title role was a cross between Lyndon Johnson and Macbeth and for which he received the first of his three Obie awards. He played the title roles in Henry 5, Hamlet (which he played 3 times), Richard 3, Macbeth, and most recently as King Lear in Robert Falls' modern adaptation at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, which Charles Isherwood of the NY Times called \"terrific\" and \"a blistering modern-dress production that brings alive the morally disordered universe of the play with a ferocity unmatched by any other production I've seen.\" Mr. Keach's stage portrayals of Peer Gynt, Falstaff and Cyrano de Bergerac, and Hamlet caused the New York Times to dub him \"the finest American classical actor since John Barrymore.\" Mr. Keach's Broadway credits include his Broadway debut, Indians, where he played Buffalo Bill and was nominated for a Tony award as Best Actor. He starred in Ira Levin's Deathtrap, the Pulitzer Prize winning Kentucky Cycle (for which he won his first Helen Hayes award as Best Actor), the Rupert Holmes one-man thriller, Solitary Confinement, where Mr. Keach played no less than six roles, all unbeknownst to the audience until the end of the play. In the musical theatre, he starred in the national tour of Barnum, played the King in Camelot for Pittsburgh's Civic Light Opera, and the King in The King and I, which he also toured in Japan. He starred in the Jon Robin Baitz play, Ten Unknowns, at the Mark Taper Forum in 2003. The LA Times said: \"And then there's Keach. What a performance! How many actors can manage such thunder and such sweet pain. He's been away from the LA stage too long. Welcome back.\" In 2004, he starred as Scrooge in Boston's Trinity Rep musical production of A Christmas Carol; earlier in 2004, he starred as Phil Ochsner in Arthur Miller's last play Finishing The Picture, directed by Robert Falls at the Goodman Theatre. As a narrator his voice has been heard in countless documentaries; as the host for the Twilight Zone radio series; numerous books on tape, including the Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway. In the year 2000, he recorded a CD of all of Shakespeare's Sonnets. He recently recorded the voice of St. Paul for a new audio version of The New Testament:, The Word of Promise and Job for the Old Testament edition. He is the narrator on CNBC's new hit show, American Greed (2007), and recently narrated the award-winning documentary, The Pixar Story (2007). He has also reprised his role as Mike Hammer in the Blackstone audio series, the most recent being \"Encore for Murder\". A charter-member of LA Theatre Works, Mr. Keach recently played the title role in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, recorded both for radio and CD. He was seen on CBS's hit show Two and a Half Men (2003) as the gay Dad of Charlie's fiance. Stacy Keach also believes strongly in 'giving back' and has been the Honorary Chair for the Cleft Palate Foundation for the past twenty-five years. He is also the national spokesman for the World Craniofacial organization. He has served on the Artist's Committee for the Kennedy Center Honors for two decades, is on the board of directors for Genesis at the Crossroads, a Chicago-based organization dedicated to bringing peoples of combatant cultures together through the shared artistic expressions of the visual and culinary arts, music, dance, and theater. He also serves on the artistic board for Washington DC's Shakespeare Theatre National Council, where he was also honored in 2000 with their prestigious Millennium Award for his contribution to classical theatre. Some years ago Hollywood honored him with a Celebrity Outreach Award for his work with charitable organizations. He has been the recipient of Lifetime Achievement Awards from Pacific Pioneer's Broadcasters, the San Diego Film Festival, the Pacific Palisades Film Festival, and The 2007 Oldenburg Film Festival in Germany. Later this year, he will be awarded the 2010 Lifetime Award from the St. Louis Film Festival. In 2008, he received the Mary Pickford Award for versatility in acting. Mr. Keach was a Fulbright scholar to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, attended the University of California at Berkeley and the Yale Drama School. He has always been a star of the American stage, especially in Shakespearen roles such as Hamlet, Henry 5, Coriolanus, Falstaff, Macbeth, Richard 3, and most recently, King Lear. Of his many accomplishments, Mr. Keach claims that his greatest accomplishment is his family. He has been married to his beautiful wife Malgosia for twenty-five years, and they have two wonderful children, Shannon Keach (1988), and daughter Karolina Keach (1990).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMzEwODQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTA0NTQz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005078","name":"Stacy Keach","idIMDB":"nm0005078"},"actorId":"nm0005078","character":"Warden Carl Golan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlotte Ross","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005383","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ODQyNjkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI4MzQyNzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 January 1968","placeOfBirth":" Winnetka, Illinois, USA","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Born and raised in Winnetka, Illinois to Princeton and Harvard grads, it was expected that Charlotte Ross would follow in her parent's footsteps and continue in the field of education. However, falling in love with acting (and singing) in the tender years of her childhood, Charlotte had other plans in mind and decided at an early age she would follow the \"Hollywood\" route instead. From that moment on, Charlotte studied with anyone and everyone she possibly could to polish and sharpen her craft (especially adored, Roy London). She worked at Second City and the Goodman Theater in Chicago and earned a early living with numerous commercial and modeling gigs. Then a month after graduating from the famous New Trier High School, Charlotte made the move to Los Angeles where she quickly landed her first role in Hollywood as 'Eve Donovan' on Days of Our Lives (1965), a role that later garnered her 2 Emmy Nominations. After a wonderful four years on the infamous Soap, she went on to pursue other roles. Charlotte then quickly jumped into starring in numerous TV movies including, A Kiss So Deadly (1996), Kidnapped in Paradise (1999), Fall Into Darkness (1996), and She Says She's Innocent (1991), to name a few. She also landed the lead in Aaron Spelling's _The Heights_ (FOX), which earned a Gold record for her and the cast's singing. She went on to release 3 albums. Since then Charlotte has remained a prominent figure in the entertainment industry, starring in TV series such as CBS's comedy The 5 Mrs. Buchanans (1994) by Marc Cherry, FOX's Mommie and Me with Pauly Shore, NBC's/John Wells' ER (1994) and later his family drama, Trinity (1998). She also starred in Showtime's critically acclaimed Beggars and Choosers (1999) as 'Lorri Valpone', a role the Los Angeles Times said made Charlotte an \"Emmy Shoe-in\". Before Beggars and Choosers was officially canceled after two seasons, Charlotte was asked to consider replacing Kim Delany on the Emmy Award winning show, NYPD Blue (1993). Charlotte gratefully jumped at the opportunity and made her debut on the ever successful cop drama as the tough talking Irish Detective, 'Connie McDowell'. Again, the media's response to Charlotte echoed that of Beggars and Choosers with the LA Times saying \"If NYPD Blue still had the popularity it once had, Charlotte would have a shelf of Emmy's\"... not to mention her famous \"Ass scene\" that caused a succession of Court appeals about standards and practices ending in the Supreme Court with President Barack Obama weighing in. At the end of her fifth season as 'Detective Connie McDowell' on NYPD Blue, Charlotte was 8 months pregnant with her first child and eager to take a break from acting to just be a Mom. After so many years of being so grateful for work, she craved a break and today still says that time off was the best decision she ever made. Two years after the birth of her beautiful little boy, Max, Charlotte went back to work starring in the \"re-tooled\" second season of ABC's, Jake in Progress , Lifetime's Nora Roberts film, Montana Sky (2007), Christmas in Paradise (2007), VH1's Hit the Floor (2013) and Law & Order (1990) as the memorable character 'Anne Coltour', which once again generated Emmy buzz. Guest starring as Deacon's ex girlfriend on ABC's Nashville (2012), Charlotte also recurs as Quinn's Mom on the hit show, _Glee_, and on CW's hit show, Arrow (2012), as the beloved Felicity's Mother, Donna (aka \"Mama Smoak\"). Charlotte continues to challenge and reinvent herself for a diverse array of roles. Whether it be showing off her athleticism as the first female umpire in professional baseball in the highly anticipated short film, The Umpire (2011), seducing Nicolas Cage as the white trash, tattoo covered sex cougar, 'Candy' in Summit's 3D film, _Drive Angry (2012)_, or starring in _Street Kings: Motor City (2013)_ opposite Ray Liotta, Charlotte continues to captivate audiences and impress critics with her unbelievable range as an actress. A successful actress for over two decades, a proud single mom to her son Max, a passionate recognized animal rights activist (widely known for PETA \"I'd rather go naked...\" campaign ) who received the HSUS Animal Advocate of the Year Award for her lobbying work on Capitol Hill to release Chimpanzee's from testing labs, a vocal fitness fanatic (recently summited Kilimanjaro) who inspires women to be in the best shape of their lives and, filming her own fitness video, Charlotte is fortunate to be able to do what she loves. She is passionate about producing as well. Once a Winnetka gal with a love of finding the truth on screen, Charlotte is now living her dream and couldn't be in a happier more grateful place in her life.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ODQyNjkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI4MzQyNzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005383","name":"Charlotte Ross","idIMDB":"nm0005383"},"actorId":"nm0005383","character":"Mary Wyatt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0189857","main":true},{"actorName":"Frank Sivero","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803370","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNDQxMTcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU0NDgyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 January 1952","placeOfBirth":" Agrigento, Sicily, Italy","birthName":"Francesco Lo Giudice","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Frank Sivero (born January 6, 1952) is an American character actor, perhaps best known for playing the roles of Genco Abbandando in Mario Puzo's and Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather Part II and Frankie Carbone (based on Angelo Sepe) in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas.
