After graduating high school in 1996, he studied briefly at New York University and Montclair State University in New Jersey but dropped out to pursue acting again. In 1997, he costarred in the short lived television series Camp Stories (1997). In 1999 came his breakthrough role in the teen sex comedy American Pie (1999).

He also starred in several family feature films, including Rookie of the Year (1993), A Kid in King Arthur's Court (1995) and it's sequel, A Kid in Aladdin's Palace (1997).

She is the daughter of Karen Sue (Cox), a sporting goods store manager, and Marvin Roger Jones, a gym teacher and fitness director. She was named after January Wayne, a character in Jacqueline Susann's potboiler Once Is Not Enough (1975). She is of Czech, Danish, English, Welsh, and German ancestry. January worked at the All-American job of counter girl at Dairy Queen after school. The family eventually moved back to Sioux Falls, the largest city in South Dakota. After graduating from Roosevelt High School in Sioux Falls, she moved to New York City to become a model. Despite her stature (5'6\", which is short for a fashion model), she got modeling gigs, including Abercrombie & Fitch ads, because of her striking good looks. However, modeling was just a means to an end, to get out of South Dakota and avoid going to college. She got her first taste of acting from TV commercials and found that she had flair for it, even though she did not act in high school and had no training. January appeared in a couple of television pilots and a cable television series before making her big screen debut in All the Rage (1999), an indie that never got a real release. She followed it up with a small role in the teen thriller The Glass House (2001). Her actual debut in the sense of attracting attention was in the near silent role of the beauty who entices Jane Fonda's son, Troy Garity, in the Bruce Willis-Cate Blanchett-Billy Bob Thornton comedy Bandits (2001). It was not a career-making part. At the time the movie was released, she was ending a three-year relationship with Ashton Kutcher. Small roles followed, including a \"don't blink or you won't see me\" part in the Adam Sandler-Jack Nicholson comedy Anger Management (2003). She gained some career traction with a good role in another comedy, American Wedding (2003), a sequel to American Pie (1999). Until she landed the part on Mad Men (2007), which made its debut on AMC in 2007, her career was steady but undistinguished. \"I choose roles that are not me\", January has said. The role of Betty Draper has garnered her two Golden Globe nominations and an Emmy nomination as Best Actress. Her cool, Grace Kelly-ish blonde ice queen looks -- counterpointed by her soul burning in her bright blue eyes -- have established her as a retro icon of the 21st Century.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODE1Mjg4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE5MjQ1Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005064","name":"January Jones","idIMDB":"nm0005064"},"actorId":"nm0005064","character":"Cadence Flaherty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002446","main":true},{"actorName":"Eugene Levy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0506405","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NTQ5NjA3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgwMjQ1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 December 1946","placeOfBirth":" Hamilton, Ontario, Canada","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Eugene Levy is an award-winning actor, writer, and producer. He has appeared in more than 60 motion pictures to date, eight of which having topped the $100M mark. The box office success of films such as Bringing Down The House, Cheaper By the Dozen 2, and Father Of The Bride Part II have established him as one of Hollywood's most popular comedic actors. But it was the role of Noah Levenstein in the American Pie franchise that cemented his reputation as America's favorite Dad. Levy's most recent big-screen role was that of Dory's Dad in the Disney/Pixar smash Finding Dory, in which he stars alongside Ellen DeGeneres and Diane Keaton. The film has surpassed the $1B mark worldwide, and is on track to become one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time. Partnering with Christopher Guest, Levy earned critical acclaim for co-writing and co-starring in Best In Show, Waiting For Guffman, For Your Consideration, and A Mighty Wind. Levy has been nominated for and won countless awards for his films including a New York Film Critics Circle Award and a Grammy Award® for A Mighty Wind and a Golden Globe® nomination for Best In Show. Other films include Splash, Armed and Dangerous, Multiplicity, Club Paradise, and Serendipity. In 2013, Levy formed Not A Real Company Productions (with his son Daniel Levy and principals Andrew Barnsley and Fred Levy) to produce Schitt's Creek, a television series for CBC/ITV he co-created, co-executive produces, and co-stars in with Daniel Levy. The single-cam, character-driven comedy also stars Catherine O'Hara, Annie Murphy, and Chris Elliott. In 2016, Levy won Lead Actor in a Comedy at the Canadian Screen Awards and, as Executive Producer, the CSA for Best Comedy, an award he shared with Daniel Levy, among others. Schitt's Creek swept the Canadian Screen Awards, winning nine of a possible 10 categories. Levy also received the prestigious Legacy Award (along with co-star and long-time collaborator, Catherine O'Hara) from the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television. Levy won two Emmys® for his writing on SCTV in addition to many other awards and nominations for his television work. Levy is a Member of the Order of Canada and a recipient of The Governor General's Performing Arts Award - the foremost honour presented for excellence in the performing arts.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NTQ5NjA3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgwMjQ1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0506405","name":"Eugene Levy","nicknames":["Butch","Gene"],"idIMDB":"nm0506405"},"actorId":"nm0506405","character":"Jim's Dad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002453","main":true},{"actorName":"Molly Cheek","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0154882","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMjA3MjczNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM4MDAxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 March 1950","placeOfBirth":" Bronxville, New York, USA","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Molly Cheek was born on March 2, 1950 in Bronxville, New York, USA.

With her patent quirky demeanor and trademark scratchy voice she is one of those gifted characters that defies description. Deborah Rush was born on April 13, 1954, in Chatham, New Jersey and developed an early interest in making people laugh as a child. Following high school she decided to pursue acting head first, apprenticing with the Playhouse of the Ridiculous comedy troupe for starters. Deborah eventually headed for New York and made her Broadway debut in the Tony-winning musical \"Dance with Me\" (1975) which ran nearly a year. Later in the decade she appeared winningly in a number of New York Shakespeare productions for Joseph Papp including \"The Misanthrope\", \"All's Well That Ends Well\", and as Bianca to Meryl Streep's Katherine and Raul Julia's Petruchio in \"The Taming of the Shrew\". She also understudied Streep's Alice in Papp's \"Alice in Concert\" musical, based on the popular Lewis Carroll character. Film and TV began coming her way in the late 70s, making her movie debut in a bit part in Oliver's Story (1978), the wan remake of the romantic tearjerker Love Story (1970). By her second film, however, she was starting to grab notice even in the smallest of contributions. Who can forget her hilarious scene as the cooey-voiced dental assistant with patient Dudley Moore in Blake Edwards' 10 (1979)? Elsewhere, Deborah's stage performances in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1982) (as Hermia), and in the Streep musical Alice at the Palace (1982) were engagingly recaptured on TV. Deborah remained strongly rooted in the theatre over the years. Other plays that captured her special brand of eccentrics included \"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You\", \"Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong\", \"Lips Together, Teeth Apart\" and \"The Sisters Rosenzweig\". Sitcoms would have seemed a vital, natural direction for Deborah's brassy talents but, strangely, she seemed to avoid that type of work. In 1983 she returned to Broadway in 1983 and, for her portrayal of Brooke Ashton in the slapstick farce \"Noises Off\", captured a Tony nomination as well as a Drama Desk Award. She returned to Broadway a couple years later to co-star with Rosemary Harris and Campbell Scott in Noël Coward's \"Hay Fever\" (1985). Character stardom proved elusive although Deborah provided amusing secondary finesse for a sprinkling of notable directors over the years including Woody Allen (twice), John Schlesinger, Sidney Lumet, and John G. Avildsen, Frank Perry and in a number of independent films. Still in all, she has that constant habit of grabbing attention wherever she works. On television, she played the recurring role of the Mayor's wife on the comedy series Spin City (1996) and had a regular part on the short-lived but critically-acclaimed series Strangers with Candy (1999). A prequel of sorts was made later with the feature film version of Strangers with Candy (2005). She has also had wonderfully off-kilter roles in The Good Girl (2002) with Jennifer Aniston, and the second \"American Pie\" sequel American Wedding (2003). More recent sightings have included a Broadway return (after a two- decade absence) in the revival of \"Absurd Person Singular\" in 2005; the off-Broadway stage role of Henrietta Iscariot in \"The Last Days of Judas Iscariot\" opposite Sam Rockwell's title role; and standout supporting work in the dramatic film Half Nelson (2006) as Ryan Gosling's wacky mom. Interestingly, the comic-edged Deborah has been married since 1985 to Chip Cronkite (né Walter Leland Cronkite III), son of the iconic news anchor, and is the mother of their two sons: Walter Cronkite IV and Peter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MjA5ODgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjY3Mzkz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0750658","name":"Deborah Rush","idIMDB":"nm0750658"},"actorId":"nm0750658","character":"Mary Flaherty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002463","main":true},{"actorName":"Fred Willard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929609","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMTQzMTc2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY5MjgyMTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 September 1939","placeOfBirth":" Shaker Heights, Ohio, USA","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Fred Willard radiates a unique charm that has established him as one of the industry's most gifted comic actors, first coming to prominence as ambitious but dimwitted sidekick Jerry Hubbard to Martin Mull's smarmy talk-show host Barth Gimble in the devastating satirical series Fernwood Tonight (1977).
