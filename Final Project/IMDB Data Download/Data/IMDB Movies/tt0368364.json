He entered films in 1912 and was playing supporting roles for Mack Sennett by 1914. He remained with Sennett until 1917 when he started numerous aristocratic roles in films. His career in sound films was somewhat limited and he played in low-budget and action serial type films. In 1939, his ex-wife, Broadway actress Margaret Campbell, was brutally murdered by their son. Swickard died a year later from natural causes, not, by jumping from the Hollywood sign as several accounts state.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I2ZmIzNGYtODk1Mi00MjcwLTk1Y2ItM2Q5MzNkN2RiZGJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842522","name":"Josef Swickard","idIMDB":"nm0842522"},"actorId":"nm0842522","character":"The toymaker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Virginia Marshall","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0551226","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 October 1918","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","bio":"Virginia Marshall was born on October 1, 1918 in Los Angeles, California, USA.
