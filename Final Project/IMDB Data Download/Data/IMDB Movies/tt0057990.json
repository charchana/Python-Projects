The following year, Toho promoted him to stardom in Kihachi Okamoto's surprise smash hit, the cynical war picture Dokuritsu Gurentai (Desperado Outpost, 1959). Thereafter he split his time between toplining Toho's war pictures and gangster pictures (but not always as the villain now). Typical of his gangster films are Ishiro Honda's Shinko no ko (1960) and Jun Fukuda's Ankokugai no Kiba (Fangs of the Underworld, 1962). This latter role allowed him to show off his comedic talents, as he played a gangster who is constantly frustrated in his hobby-quest to build the perfect house of cards. Sato remains working and much in demand in Japanese films and TV through the present day.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766491","name":"Makoto Satô","idIMDB":"nm0766491"},"actorId":"nm0766491","character":"Shuri Kusanagi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yuriko Hoshi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0395953","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 December 1943","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","bio":"Born on December 6 1943, Yuriko Hoshi was one of the younger members of the Toho stable of actors during the 1960s.

After she graduated from acting school in 1957, her screen debut was in the Minoru Shibuya film Crazy Society. By the time her second film Futari dake no hashi (1958) came out, she changed her name to \"Kumi Mizuno.\" Her attractive looks and pleasant demeanor made her a favorite of director Ishirô Honda. Thus, she was cast in a host of drama, comedy and sci-fi films from Toho Studios. She became one of Japan's most popular actresses in their \"Golden Age\" of cinema, appearing with actor Nick Adams in Frankenstein Conquers the World (1965) and Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965). They were claimed to be romantically linked during the filming of these two films, but they denied the claims as gossip. Kumi's role as Daiyo in Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster (1966) was one of her most memorable performances. This film was originally written to star King Kong, hence the love relationship between Godzilla and Kumi--a love relationship more associated with King Kong. Even though she has few specific memories of her work on sci-fi films during the 1960s, she does reminisce those films fondly. Evidently, she became a Godzilla legend, as she returned to appear in two of the six Godzilla films from the \"Millennium\" series in 2002 and 2004.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594682","name":"Kumi Mizuno","idIMDB":"nm0594682"},"actorId":"nm0594682","character":"The Witch","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mitsuko Kusabue","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0476179","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 October 1933","placeOfBirth":" Yokohama, Japan","height":"5' 2¼\" (1.58 m)","bio":"Mitsuko Kusabue was born on October 22, 1933 in Yokohama, Japan.

Upon graduating from Tokyo University (Japan's most prestigious), Hirata confounded many family expectations of him by pursuing a career in acting. His first roles, in EVEN THE MIGHTY SHED TEARS and EMBRACE (1953), brought him to the attention of director Ishiro Honda, who promptly cast Hirata first in his WW2 romance FAREWELL RABAUL (1954) and then, later that year, in the role that would come to define Hirata's career: the tormented, one-eyed scientist Daisuke Serizawa, who alone has figured out a way to destroy the monster GOJIRA. That movie made stars out of all of the younger actors who were fortunate enough to star in it, though Hirata tended more towards second leads and character parts. He was often called the best-known of all actors to appear in Gojira movies (he would turn up in six of the sequels), but this was due as much to his popularity with directors as with his exposure through the monster movies. He was a favorite of directors Ishiro Honda, Jun Fukuda, Hiroshi Inagaki, and much beloved by virtually all the actors who knew him: honest and humorous, highly intellectual but never pretentious. He appeared in literally every kind of movie Toho Studios made, from the monster pictures to samurai dramas (including his one movie for Kurosawa, SANJURO) to war dramas to comedies. Still, he remained identified most directly in the public's mind with the original GOJIRA; his character Serizawa is among the best remembered and most admired in all Japanese films, both inside Japan and out. Hirata was chosen by Toho to announce the monster's return in GOJIRA (1984), and was tapped for a major role; but he died tragically of lung cancer before he could begin shooting.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386284","name":"Akihiko Hirata","idIMDB":"nm0386284"},"actorId":"nm0386284","character":"Ryutaro Inoue","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sachio Sakai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757021","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 February 1929","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","bio":"Sachio Sakai was born on February 13, 1929 in Tokyo, Japan.

He was born in Tsingtao, China, to Japanese parents and grew up in Dalian. He did not set foot in Japan until he was 21. His father was an importer and a commercial photographer, and young Toshiro worked in his father's studio for a time after graduating from Dalian Middle School. He was automatically drafted into the Japanese army when he turned 20, and enlisted in the Air Force where he was attached to the Aerial Photography Unit for the duration of the World War II. In 1947 he took a test for Kajirô Yamamoto, who recommended him to director Senkichi Taniguchi, thus leading to Mifune's first film role in These Foolish Times II (1947). Mifune then met and bonded with director Akira Kurosawa, and the two joined to become the most prominent actor-director pairing in all Japanese cinema. Beginning with Drunken Angel (1948), Mifune appeared in 16 of Kurosawa's films, most of which have become world-renowned classics. In Kurosawa's pictures, especially Rashomon (1950), Mifune would become the most famous Japanese actor in the world. A dynamic and ferocious actor, he excelled in action roles, but also had the depth to plumb intricate and subtle dramatic parts. A personal rift during the filming of Red Beard (1965) ended the Mifune-Kurosawa collaboration, but Mifune continued to perform leading roles in major films both in Japan and in foreign countries. He was twice named Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (for Yojimbo (1961) and Red Beard (1965)). In 1963 he formed his own production company, directing one film and producing several others. In his later years he gained new fame in the title role of the American TV miniseries Shogun (1980), and appeared infrequently in cameo roles after that. His last years were plagued with Alzheimer's Syndrome and he died of organ failure in 1997, a few months before the death of the director with whose name he will forever be linked, Akira Kurosawa.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NzE2MzEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5MTU4Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536","name":"Toshirô Mifune","nicknames":["The Wolf","The Shogun"],"idIMDB":"nm0001536"},"actorId":"nm0001536","character":"Lord Akashi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryû Kuze","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0476732","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 January 1908","placeOfBirth":" Ehime, Japan","bio":"Ryû Kuze was born on January 19, 1908 in Ehime, Japan.
