His father was an Albanian immigrant, from Qytezë, and his mother was also of Albanian descent. The third of four children - his brother was John Belushi - he grew up in Wheaton, Illinois. A high school teacher, impressed by his improvisational skills while giving speeches, convinced him to to be in a school play. After that, he joined the school's drama club.

In 1977, he joined Chicago's Second City improv troupe and remained for three years. In 1979, Garry Marshall saw Jim performing for Second City and arranged for him to come to Hollywood and co-star in the TV pilot Who's Watching the Kids (1978) for Paramount and, then, for a role in the series Working Stiffs (1979) (co-starring Michael Keaton). Later, in 1983, he joined the cast of Saturday Night Live (1975) for two years. Jim came to national attention in About Last Night...

The solidly built 6' 3\" Richmond has regularly played the bad guy on-screen. He's been on the receiving end of the fists of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando (1985), gotten pummeled by Carl Weathers in Action Jackson (1988) and tangled with Steven Seagal in Hard to Kill (1990). Richmond is the son of movie stuntman Leo C. Richmond and first broke into film and TV in the early 1970s with minor roles in shows such as The Bionic Woman (1976), The Rockford Files (1974) and Magnum, P.I. (1980). From there he quickly picked up work in numerous made-for-TV movies and was kept busy throughout the 1980s and 1990s with appearances in such A-grade productions as Licence to Kill (1989), Best Seller (1987) and Batman Returns (1992). He even found himself in the children's film Curly Sue (1991). In early 1991 Richmond scored the key role of \"Bobby Six Killer\" in the bounty hunter-themed TV series Renegade (1992) starring alongside Lorenzo Lamas and Kathleen Kinmont.

Additionally, Richmond has starred in plenty of B-movie action films and has become quite a cult figure of the genre. Since the late 1990s, Richmond has remained busy on several fronts. He's continued acting in Hollywood, is the official spokesman for Indian Motorcycles and is the lead singer for the band \"Branscombe Richmond and the Renegade Posse\".

He is the son of Harriet T. (Koch), a psychiatric nurse, and Edwin A. Carell, an electrical engineer. His mother is of Polish descent and his father is of Italian and German ancestry (Steve's grandfather had changed the surname from \"Caroselli\" to \"Carrell\"). He was educated at The Fenn School, an all-boys private school in Concord, Massachusetts, then at Middlesex School in Concord. After graduating from Denison University in Granville, Ohio, he moved to Chicago where he taught an improvisational comedy class and performed with The Second City troupe, alongside Stephen Colbert. Carell made his film debut as \"Tesio\" in Curly Sue (1991). In 1996, he became a cast member of The Dana Carvey Show (1996), and provided the voice for Gary, opposite Colbert in \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\". This animated short series produced by Robert Smigel continued on Saturday Night Live (1975), but Carell has joked that he auditioned for SNL and lost the job to Will Ferrell. Carell made a number of guest appearances on such shows as Come to Papa (2004), Just Shoot Me! (1997), and Watching Ellie (2002), before landing a regular stint as a correspondent on The Daily Show (1996) from 1999 until 2005. Carell played Evan Baxter opposite Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty (2003), and Uncle Arthur opposite Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell in Bewitched (2005). He broke out as a leading man after starring in the summer box-office hit The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), which he also co-wrote; the film was chosen as one of the Top Ten movies of 2006 by the American Film Institute. He next starred in the critically acclaimed Little Miss Sunshine (2006), an indie dark comedy which became a surprise hit and earned four Oscar nominations, and won two (Best Supporting Actor for Alan Arkin and Best Screenplay for Michael Arndt). In 2007, Carell reprised his role as Evan Baxter, filling Jim Carrey's leading-man shoes as a politician asked by God to build a giant ark in Evan Almighty (2007), the second installment of the \"Almighty\" franchise, co-starring Lauren Graham and Morgan Freeman. In 2008, he re-united with Jim Carrey in the highly successful animation hit Horton Hears a Who! (2008), then appeared as Agent Maxwell Smart in the popular comedy Get Smart (2008). Throughout this time, Carell maintained a successful career in television, starring as Michael Scott in the American remake of the Britain's existential comedy, The Office (2005). He received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in Television Comedy for this leading role in 2006, and earned both Emmy and Golden Globe nominations each consecutive show until he departed in 2011. In 2010, Carell announced he was leaving \"The Office\" to concentrate on his film career, and has made steady appearance in such films as Date Night (2010), Despicable Me (2010), Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), and Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012). Carell's most recent roles are the comedies Despicable Me 2 (2013), Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013), and Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (2014), and the drama Foxcatcher (2014).

The couple have two children, daughter Elisabeth (born in May 2001), and son John (born in June 2004). Steve Carell lives with his family in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMjkzNzA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyNjU3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136797","name":"Steve Carell","idIMDB":"nm0136797"},"actorId":"nm0136797","character":"Tesio","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0453977","main":true},{"actorName":"Gail Boggs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0091768","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NzU5NzU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ3MjU3MDE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Gail Boggs is an actress and executive, known for Edtv (1999), Ghost (1990) and Curly Sue (1991).

She retired when the dance teacher was arrested on a morals charge for \"dating\" the tall and lissome, yet underage, star dancer in the troupe. That girl's big number culminated with a back-bend where Edie drank a soda upside down (of course). Edie has a Master of Science from Syracuse and taught radio at the University of Missouri/Kansas City for eight years. There she re-entered the entertainment field as a DJ, newswoman and producer for the NPR affiliate KCUR-FM. Her proudest moment was portraying John Ehrlichman in Conversation 26 of the NPR national broadcast of the Nixon Tape Transcripts. Thus did Edie contribute to the peaceful overthrow of the government of an unindicted co-conspirator. Her career-long devotion to satirical improvisation included an impressive tenure with The Groundlings. She went on to create original characters, performed on the daytime The David Letterman Show (1980): Mrs. Marv Mendenhall, Dot Duncan, Whirly June Pickens, Officer Jeanelle Archer, 105-year-old Edie, etc. TV has been a home to many of Edie's characters--on The Richard Pryor Show (1977); as Lucille Tarlek, wife of mega-obnoxious ad salesman Herb Tarlek on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978); and as Mrs. Poole on Valerie (1986). Her movie career growth paralleled her ten years with The Groundlings. Her first film was the teen horror favorite Carrie (1976). She did several John Hughes films, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), She's Having a Baby (1988) and _Curly Sue (1990)_. Offbeat cult faves are Eating Raoul (1982), Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988), HBO's The Pee Wee Herman Show (1981) and Martin Mull's The History of White People in America (1985). In more mainstream films, she received a National Media Award for her portrayal of a mentally disabled woman in Bill: On His Own (1983), starring Mickey Rooney. She's acted for Robert Redford in A River Runs Through It (1992), for Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers (1994), for Diane Keaton in Raccroche! (2000) and she was named Best Actress of the Chicago Alternative Film Festival for her portrayal of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski's mother. A few of Edie's most recent accomplishments: Fat Actress (2005)' Rude Lady in Restroom, David Spade's nasty neighbor in Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003), Dana Carvey's mother in Sony Pictures' The Master of Disguise (2002), Jane Kaczmarek's friend in Malcolm in the Middle (2000), guest-starring on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), NBC's Providence (1999), WB's 7th Heaven (1996), Lea Thompson's mother on Caroline in the City (1995) and several animation roles for TV and in features, such as The Little Mermaid (1989), The Rugrats Movie (1998) and as Dr. Flora in A Bug's Life (1998).
