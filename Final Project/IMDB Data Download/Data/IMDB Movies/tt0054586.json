Mario calls to mind the actor's Italian roots (his father was a Calabrian surgeon) whereas Adorf reveals his German origins (his mother was a radiologist from the German region Eifel). As for the full name Mario Adorf it echoes to perfection the international character of this living legend's long career. Born in 1930, Mario Adorf was still studying drama at the famous Otto Falkenberg School in Munich when he landed his first role in the first installment of the \"O8/15\" series in 1954. It was a small part but it didn't go unnoticed and got him new roles in German films, the most remarkable of which being that of Bruno Lüdke, the mentally retarded serial killer in Robert Siodmak's 1957 masterpiece \"Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam\". It earned him his first prize (the German Film Award of the outstanding young actor of 1958). After this Mario Adorf's career turned international. His Mediterranean looks, his rugged face, his dark oily frizzy hair and his volubility made him an ideal villain in European-made westerns, spy or mafia films. These flicks - made in the 1960s - were mostly just commercial and Adorf hammed his parts but he did it so brilliantly that he alone made them watchable. From the 1970s on, the quality of his films improved and Adorf could lend his remarkable acting talents to more ambitious works such as \"Il Delitto Matteotti\", in which he was a striking Mussolini, or \"Die Blechtrommel\", where he was terrifying as a boorish grocer contaminated by Nazism. The list of great directors he worked with is impressive: Robert Siodmak, Volker Schlöndorff, Wolgang Staudte, Michel Deville, Dino Risi, Mikhaïl Kalatozov, Luigi Comencini, Peter Fleischmann, Billy Wilder, John Frankenheimer, Claude Chabrol, Fassbinder... Likewise he served many a great author, either in the theatre (Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Richard Nash) or the big or small screen (Grass, Böll, Schnitzler, Heny Miller, Joseph Conrad, Gorky, Patrick Süskind...). He also sang and wrote books (five novels and one memoir). Hyperactive for more than fifty-five years now, Mario Adorf, still in fine form at the age of seventy-eight, is still ... hyperactive!","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDliNTUxZDgtYzVlOS00NzQ2LTk4NjUtZTM5NWNkNDM4N2VjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000728","name":"Mario Adorf","idIMDB":"nm0000728"},"actorId":"nm0000728","character":"Mario Tagliabue","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Valeria Moriconi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0605410","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 November 1931","placeOfBirth":" Jesi, Marche, Italy","birthName":"Valeria Maria Abbruzzetti","bio":"Valeria Moriconi was born in Jesi, Marche region, in the centre of Italy.

He began working in theatre and television, where he was soon noticed as one of the most promising actors of his generation. After several supporting appearances in film, he reached notoriety with the character of Ramón Rojo in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964). This success was doubled in Leone's next film, For a Few Dollars More (1965). The following ten years would be the most intense of Volontè career. L'armée Brancaleone (1966) (directed by Mario Monicelli) was the most successful Italian movie of the year, We Still Kill the Old Way (1967) (directed by Elio Petri) won the Grand Prix du Scenario at the Cannes Film Festival, and Volontè won his first Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon - the most presitgious acting award in Italy) in 1970 for Enquête sur un citoyen au-dessus de tout soupçon (1970) (also directed by Petri), making him an international star. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and two Italian Golden Globes, including one for his performance. In 1972, he starred in two Italian movies as the protagonist: Petri's Lulu the Tool (1971) and Francesco Rosi's The Mattei Affair (1972), both of which win the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, where he also wins a Special Mention. In his life, Volontè won a huge number of other prizes and honours, becoming one of the most celebrated Italian actors of the seventies, and challenging Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni as the most popular Italian actor. He died in Greece in 1994.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NTU2NDU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNjMyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002231","name":"Gian Maria Volontè","idIMDB":"nm0002231"},"actorId":"nm0002231","character":"Papaleo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Raymond Bussières","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124482","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1907","placeOfBirth":" Ivry-la-Bataille, Eure, Haute-Normandie, France","bio":"Raymond Bussières was born on November 3, 1907 in Ivry-la-Bataille, Eure, Haute-Normandie, France.
