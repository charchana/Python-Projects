His parents died while he was in his early teens, forcing him to quit school and take such jobs as a grocery clerk, surveyor and oil field worker. He went to Hollywood in 1919, already gray-haired. His first role was as an extra in Cecil B. DeMille's Why Change Your Wife? (1920). He bought some fancy clothes, caught DeMille's eye and got the romantic lead in The Volga Boatman (1926), quickly becoming a matinée idol and earning upwards of $100,000 a year. However, with the end of silent movies, Boyd was without a contract, couldn't find work and was going broke. By mistake his picture was run in a newspaper story about the arrest of another actor with a similar name (William 'Stage' Boyd) on gambling, liquor and morals charges, and that hurt his career even more. In 1935 he was offered the lead role in Hop-Along Cassidy (1935) (named because of a limp caused by an earlier bullet wound). He changed the original pulp-fiction character to its opposite, made sure that \"Hoppy\" didn't smoke, drink, chew tobacco or swear, rarely kissed agirl and let the bad guy draw first. By 1943 he had made 54 \"Hoppies\" for his original producer, Harry Sherman; after Sherman dropped the series, Boyd produced and starred in 12 more on his own. The series was wildly popular and all at least doubled their profit. In 1948 Boyd, in a savvy and precedent-setting move, bought the rights to all his pictures, he had to sell his ranch to raise the money, just as TV was looking for Saturday-morning Western fare. He marketed all sorts of \"Hoppy\" products, lunch boxes, toy guns, cowboy hats, etc., and received royalties from comic books, radio and records. He retired to Palm Desert, California, in 1953. In 1968 he had surgery to remove a tumor from a lymph gland and, from then on, refused all interview and photograph requests.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMTUyNjY0OTNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDk2NDM0Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101955","name":"William Boyd","idIMDB":"nm0101955"},"actorId":"nm0101955","character":"Captain Hal Winslow","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elinor Fair","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265407","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2OTA5NjkyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgyNjc3MTE@._V1._CR108.88333129882812,144.53334045410156,502,720_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 December 1903","placeOfBirth":" Richmond, Virginia, USA","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Elinor Fair was born on December 21, 1903 in Richmond, Virginia, USA.

DeMille. He was her mentor, while she was for many years his mistress (a liaison which was tolerated by De Mille's long-suffering wife Constance Adams). Julia was born in Richmond, Virginia, of French-American parentage. She had a Southern drawl which she never lost. When she was six months old her family moved to St. Louis, MO, where she spent most of her early childhood. She was educated at Illinois State University. Her parents intended for her to have a teaching career, but Julia had other ideas. She started out as a model for fashion magazines, touted as \"the girl with the perfect legs\" and \"the prettiest feet and ankles in America\". Her photo shoots did not escape the attention of De Mille, who summoned her for an audition (though, according to author Charles Higham, it was actor Wallace Reid who first introduced Julia to De Mille at a party). Her \"pegs\" certainly passed muster and Julia was fast-tracked to the silver screen, initially appearing in a few small roles at Fine Arts=Paramount. Casting directors were also eager to utilize her as a \"leg model\", doubling for actresses deemed less endowed in that department. In 1916 Julia moved to Keystone as one of Mack Sennett's Bathing Beauties and knockabout comediennes, occasionally as leading lady and at times performing her own stunts. Despite limitations to her acting ability, Julia was possessed of sophistication, wit and charm. which contributed to her having a pretty good career for the better part of the 1920s. She was featured in billed supporting roles in a number of De Mille's big-budget extravaganzas, including The Ten Commandments (1923) (as Pharaoh's wife), The Volga Boatman (1926) (as a gypsy) and The King of Kings (1927) (as Martha). Dynamite (1929), co-scripted by another De Mille protégé and mistress (not to mention fierce rival), Jeanie Macpherson, gave Julia her best opportunity to shine in a meatier role. However, by the early 1930s her career was already in decline. Perhaps hoping to emulate Macpherson, she proceeded to study screenwriting for three years under De Mille's tutelage, but, in the end, to little avail. Eventually, offers from Hollywood dried up and her money ran out. To his credit, De Mille continued to support Julia by putting her on the payroll as one of his regular stock players. She went on to appear in cameos and bit parts in his films for another two decades, usually without dialogue. Her last film role was as a dowager in The Buccaneer (1958). Julia Faye died in April 1966 at the age of 72. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTE0MDIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkyNjc3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269671","name":"Julia Faye","nicknames":["The Vampette","The Legs of the Lasky Lot"],"idIMDB":"nm0269671"},"actorId":"nm0269671","character":"Queen Victoria","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028321","main":true},{"actorName":"Harry Holden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0390196","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 May 1867","placeOfBirth":" Franklin, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Harry Moore Holden","bio":"Harry Holden was born on May 15, 1867 in Franklin, Ohio, USA as Harry Moore Holden.
