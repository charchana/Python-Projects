She appeared in two of the best remembered French films of the 1930s: Pépé le Moko (1937) and Gueule d'amour (1937), both opposite Jean Gabin. After the German occupation of France and her separation from her long-time fiancé, the singer/actor Tino Rossi in 1942, she starred in several films and became the idol of the Paris High Society where she met the love of her life, Birl Desbok, an officer in the Wehrmacht. In the summer of 1944, as Paris was about to be liberated, she and Desbok fled Paris and tried to reach the Italian border but on September 28th, 1944 they were arrested by the FFI in Beausoleil (near Nice). Separated from Desbok, who was probably executed (she never knew what really happened to him), she was beaten and raped before being taken to Nice prison. She was soon transferred to Fresnes prison (near Paris) where she stayed until her release on bail on 3rd January 1945. She was forbidden to work for a year but once this restriction lifted, she went back to the studios to appear in what proved to be her last film La dernière chevauchée (1947), her frail constitution prevented her from appearing in any other films. She died in 1968, forgotten and broke.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2I2MjY0ODItNTQ1Zi00OTRiLWE1ZmEtMDY3M2FkOTJmNzhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050249","name":"Mireille Balin","idIMDB":"nm0050249"},"actorId":"nm0050249","character":"Marie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Simone Cerdan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148502","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 November 1897","placeOfBirth":" Fontainebleau, Seine-et-Marne, France","birthName":"Simone Marguerite Chemin","bio":"Simone Cerdan was born on November 28, 1897 in Fontainebleau, Seine-et-Marne, France as Simone Marguerite Chemin.

But, as is often the case with great names of the stage, Marchat's movie career does not live up to what he achieved on the boards. The handsome, manly, impressive actor could proudly say: 'I served Corneille, Péguy, Gide, Giraudoux, Mérimée, Roblès ... and many others'. He certainly did not boast about the ones he worked for in films: Gleize, Paulin, Stelli, Reinert, Vernay or Kapps! Not that any of their work was systematically terrible but those filmmakers definitely lacked ambition and personality. Occasionally though, Marchat would appear in a more artistic work. He was in a scene or two for Grémillon, Bresson or Guitry. But most of the time he lent his name to run-of-the-mill productions. He did it playing by the rules, without disdain. He always brought all his authority and his assurance to the characters he played, inferior as the film he was in was. He particularly shone when he embodied unpleasant fellows (an arrogant aristocrat, an upper class criminal, a spy, a collaborator) or figures of authority such as judges, prosecutors, bishops, generals and nobles.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0545461","name":"Jean Marchat","idIMDB":"nm0545461"},"actorId":"nm0545461","character":"Ramon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Suzy Prim","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0697512","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 October 1896","placeOfBirth":" Paris, Ile-de-France, France","birthName":"Suzanne Mariette Arduini","bio":"Suzy Prim was born on October 11, 1896 in Paris, Ile-de-France, France as Suzanne Mariette Arduini.

He was one of the first few thespians to accept to play in moving pictures, as early as 1910, whereas most of his fellow actors regarded this new medium as definitely lowbrow. Fortunately for the spectators, a pocketful of repertory performers such as Le Bargy, Henri Rollan or the great Sarah Bernhardt saw no shame in bringing culture to a popular public that never went to the theatre, quite the opposite. Nevertheless, Henri Rollan did not grace many classics with his presence. Too bad because he would have been excellent in Renoir, Bresson, Clouzot or Autant-Lara's masterpieces. Henri Rollan was all too often in run-of-the mill productions of his time, forgettable and forgotten undemanding fare. Among the exceptions are his roles of the night watchman of the Eiffel Tower in René Clair's silent oddity \"Paris qui dort\" (1923), of the incompetent Maréchal d'Estrée in the famous \"Fanfan la Tulipe\" (Christian-Jaque, 1951) and of a French politician in Jacques Becker's \"Les Aventures d'Arsène Lupin. He was also long remembered for being Athos in Diamant-Berger two versions (one silent, one talking) of Dumas' \"Les trois Mousquetaires\". And that is about all. Which does not mean that he was not effective in the films he appeared in. He was always a great professional and his performances (most often as a tough, stiff, humorless character endowed with authority) are excellent whatever the film he is in. Of course where he really shone was on stage, as an actor first, later as a renowned director. He was also a much loved and respected drama teacher who guided among others the first steps of Jean Claudio, Jacques Fabbri, Raymond Devos, Anna Gaylor, Annie Girardot, Marie Dubois and Jacques Lorcey. None of these persons ever forgot Henri Rollan, a passionate man who had the gift to transmit his genuine passion to other young passionates.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0738305","name":"Henri Rollan","idIMDB":"nm0738305"},"actorId":"nm0738305","character":"Marcel Forgery","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Françoise Rosay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741147","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJkM2E4Y2QtMmEyMC00MjkxLWE0YjEtYzhhOTFlNzJlNzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzAwOTU1MTk@._V1_UY44_CR12,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 April 1891","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Françoise Bandy de Nalèche","bio":"Françoise Rosay was born on April 19, 1891 in Paris, France as Françoise Bandy de Nalèche.
