He spent his childhood in Tetovo, a town in Macedonia at the foot of the Sharr mountains. His entire family is of Albanian origin. Blerim has been living and working in Germany and Macedonia for the past ten years. Blerim discovered his passion for acting at an early age. Full of ambition, he has been pursuing his goal, dedicating his time and energy to the topics of film and acting. At 14 years of age, he made his acting debut in the Albanian TV film \"Atje ku nuk lind dielli\" (Sun doesn't rise there). While producing short documentaries, he began taking acting classes in England. In 2004, Blerim was offered his first major role in a film. He attracted significant public attention in Southeast Europe by playing the part of the main character \"Beni\" in the Kosovar TV production \"Metropolet\" (director: Sunaj Raca). The action-packed coming-of-age drama \"Metropolet\" deals with the fate of the young Albanian boy Beni, who is hoping to attain financial wealth in Germany within a short time. In order to achieve this target, he abandons his family and friends and hooks up with the gangster Musa. However, the plan does not work out and Beni ends up in prison. Reformed by several years' imprisonment, Beni realises that it is not that easy to leave the past behind ... The successful cooperation with the well-known director Sunaj Raca was continued in 2005 in the motion picture Kosova: Desperate Search (2006). The film recounts the repercussions and effects of the Kosovar war on the Albanian population. Ethnic cleansings and other atrocities mentally and physically destroyed the people. The entwined destinies of individual persons and families from various geographic regions and social classes are the basis of a closely interconnected storyline. Families are not only looking for their missing children, but also for new hope and perspectives. In this film, Blerim very impressively impersonates the complex character of a man who needs to prove his qualities as a soldier, a husband and a father. However, Blerim is not just an actor - ha takes a broad interest in all aspects of filmmaking and has already gained some experience in the fields of directing and producing. He was the associate producer of the internationally successful Macedonian cinema production The Great Water (2004) (directed by Ivo Trajkov) shot in 2004. In 2005, \"The Great Water\" was shown at many renowned festivals and received a number of awards. Blerim is currently continuing his professional training to be an actor by taking elocution lessons in order to further upgrade his abilities and prepare for new international film projects in 2006.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzE4MzYxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkyMzM1NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1773716","name":"Blerim Destani","idIMDB":"nm1773716"},"actorId":"nm1773716","character":"Türke","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"André Hennicke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0377333","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxZDRmZTAtNmJhMS00ZDU1LWEzYTgtN2JjMDZmYmI1YTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 September 1958","placeOfBirth":" Steinheidel-Erlabrunn, German Democratic Republic","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"André Hennicke was born on September 21, 1958 in Steinheidel-Erlabrunn, German Democratic Republic.

At the age of nine, she moved to Frankfurt / Main in Germany with her family, being one of the lucky ones to escape Ceausescu's regime thanks to her mother's German heritage. Growing up in a communist country, most youngsters had to take up a sport or art in order to escape bleak future and Valentina was not an exception. She became a competitive swimmer, an activity she continued to pursue in Germany with the same zest and determination, eventually leading her to the German championships. After five years of success and being spotted by the DSV (German swimming federation) who wanted her to quit her club (the SG Frankfurt) and move to Bonn to train with the best in the country, the pressure became to high on the then 14 year-old. 4 hours of daily training and competitions every weekend were too much - Valentina's mother decided to stop the young girl's career. This was probably the first time Valentina regained her freedom to fullfil her dreams. She started exploring what her future would hold by becoming a model in order to make the money to enter the prestigious R.A.D.A (Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts) in London. Being an actress was a dream since, aged 7, she saw Alain Delon on the big screen in a Bucharest cinema. At the age of 18, she moved to London and was snapped up by world leading agency, Select. Very quickly she rose to the top of modelling and for the next 4 years she was busy jetting between London, Paris, Milan and other fashion capitals. Acting had to wait. Although Valentina was a natural in front of the camera, she quickly became bored with the industry and moved to Los Angeles. Whilst there she was still working as a model for the prestigious agency L.A. Models, but in the meantime completed a one-year course in interior design at the Santa Monica College. However, she longed to return to Europe and decided to move to Paris in 1993. At first she was back in the modelling business, which led to the encounter with photographer Corinne Korda - a friend and \"lens-witness\" of her evolution ever since. The latter pointed out to Valentina that she was a natural performer and she finally admitted that acting was what she had always wanted to do. Thus encouraged, she entered an audition for the much coveted scholarship to the prestigious acting school Cours Florent and won. She had to read the plays for the competition in English or German and working them phonetically in French - a language she by then couldn't speak yet. Thanks to her obvious talent, she was admitted immediately into the 2nd year of studies. This had happened only to one actress before her: Anne Brochet (of Cyrano de Bergerac fame). However, after this initial short cut, the usual struggle any actor experiences started. Step by step, she worked her way up in theatre, TV and movies. Her first big break came when Jean Jacques Beineix, the famous director of Diva and Betty Blue, recognized her talent and gave the unknown young actress one of the leading female parts in the psychological comedy, Mortal Transfer. Soon after they fell in love and their daughter was born in 2001. Valentina continued working, but by now most of her time and energy went into family life. In 2005 she was casted to present the life style magazine \" CHIC\" for the French/German TV channel ARTE. She presented it in both German and French. For this performance (a total of 200 shows in two languages in one year), she was nominated in 2006 as best presenter for the price of the city of St. Maur. By then separated from the father of her daughter, she fell in love with the documentary director Christophe Maillet; the new couple's son was born in 2008. One year later, she started working again for German and French TV productions and made a remarkable cameo appearance in German director Leander Haussman's movie Dinosaurier. In 2010, she went back on stage in Paris in Sacha Guitry's play \"Je t'aime\". Valentina has been working for French and German TV ever since. In 2012 Valentina will appear as the leading female part in German director Nicolai Muellerschoen's new movie \"Gier\" alongside Heiner Lauterbach, one of Germany's biggest stars. Valentina considers herself a German actress, but also a genuinely European one. She is fluent in several languages and has lived in different countries.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766516","name":"Valentina Sauca","idIMDB":"nm0766516"},"actorId":"nm0766516","character":"Jasmin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Friedrich von Thun","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903110","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMzU4MjY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODAzNjky._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1942","placeOfBirth":" Kwassitz, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia [now Kvasice, Moravia, Czech Republic]","birthName":"Friedrich Ernst Peter Paul Maria Graf von Thun und Hohenstein","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Friedrich von Thun was born on June 30, 1942 in Kwassitz, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia as Friedrich Ernst Peter Paul Maria Graf von Thun und Hohenstein.
