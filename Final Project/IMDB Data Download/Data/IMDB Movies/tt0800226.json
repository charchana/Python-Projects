Following graduation from Wesleyan University, this tall (5'7\") beauty moved to New York and developed her skills working in daytime television and theater. Dana starred in the Broadway show \"A Life\" and received critical acclaim in a number of off-Broadway productions as well. Her role in Nicholas Kazan's controversial \"Bloodmoon\" in New York led her to Hollywood. Dana acted in a number of TV series, working steadily until she could get her own starring vehicle. That happened in 1988 when Dana became identified with Army nurse Colleen McMurphy in ABC TV's critically acclaimed series China Beach (1988), the role earning her three Emmy nominations and two Emmy Awards as Best Actress. Dana moved on to movies and eventually started getting starring roles in films, such as Exit to Eden (1994). With over a dozen TV and movie projects within the last few years, Dana is one of the busiest actresses in Hollywood.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNjQ2ODk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc3MDI2Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001127","name":"Dana Delany","idIMDB":"nm0001127"},"actorId":"nm0001127","character":"Lois Lane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000198","main":true},{"actorName":"Lance Henriksen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000448","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkwOTMyMDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4NTUyMg@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 May 1940","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Lance James Henriksen","height":"5' 10¼\" (1.79 m)","bio":"An intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (The X-Files (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\". Henriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien: Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra. James Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), then used him again in The Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Mort ou vif (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998). In addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkwOTMyMDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4NTUyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000448","name":"Lance Henriksen","idIMDB":"nm0000448"},"actorId":"nm0000448","character":"Brainiac","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000194","main":true},{"actorName":"George Dzundza","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001169","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MTgxNjkzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0NDgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 July 1945","placeOfBirth":" Rosenheim, Bavaria, Germany","birthName":"George F.

He started getting big parts in movies, which led to a regular role on Days of Our Lives (1965) and, ultimately, to M*A*S*H (1972). When M*A*S*H (1972) went off the air, he resisted series TV for many years until he was offered Providence (1999).

He lobbied against the firing of gay teachers. He was outspoken about the US involvement in Ecuador in the 80s.

She was born Michele Marie Fabares on January 19, 1944, in sunny Santa Monica, Californnia. As the niece of singer/comedienne Nanette Fabray, she was indoctrinated early into the show biz life. Tap dancing from age three, she also modeled during her elementary school and began appearing on such TV shows as Captain Midnight (1954) and Annie Oakley (1954) (the latter a recurring role). At age 12, she made her professional film debut in the Rock Hudson/Cornell Borchers tearjerker Never Say Goodbye (1956) as Hudson's daughter, and went on to play kid sister roles in the rock 'n' roll-themed Rock, Pretty Baby (1956) and its sequel Summer Love (1957) both starring John Saxon. Teen-idol status came with her coming-of-age role as the ever-wholesome daughter \"Mary Stone\" on The Donna Reed Show (1958), a part she played for five seasons before embarking on a more grown-up film career. During the run of the classic sitcom, she and TV \"brother\" Paul Petersen grew so popular that they sprinted to adjoining pop singing celebrity, although both admitted that their vocal talents were limited. Shelley especially enjoyed a #1 Billboard hit with the breathy, sultry-edged \"Johnny Angel\". The character of \"Mary Stone\" was gently phased out of the show as her character \"left for college\". By this time, Shelley had turned into quite a curvaceous stunner. Her acting mettle hardly tested, she managed to become part of the bikini-clad blonde set with top femme parts in such fun-and-frolic fare as Ride the Wild Surf (1964), Hold On! (1966), which was a vehicle for British singing sensation Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits, and three of Elvis Presley's less-acclaimed vehicles of the later 1960s: Girl Happy (1965), Spinout (1966) and Clambake (1967). A serious Vietnam-era stream of consciousness began to pervade film audiences in the late 1960s and Shelley's perky innocence that found so much favor during the Camelot years had lost its appeal. After a notoriously dry spell, she bounced back as the altruistic wife of a dying footballer \"Brian Piccolo\" in Brian's Song (1971), opposite James Caan, and settled comfortably again on the small screen with bright co-star roles on the series The Brian Keith Show (1972), The Practice (1976), and Highcliffe Manor (1979). A more prickly character than usual, however, reared its head in the late-night soap spoof Forever Fernwood (1977), and this led to the equally malicious, vainglorious role of Bonnie Franklin's business competitor on the already-established hit sitcom One Day at a Time (1975). The show also featured her aunt Nanette Fabray as Franklin's meddling mom. In the late 1980s, Shelley found a fleshier character as Craig T. Nelson's resourceful mate on Coach (1989), earning steady work for eight seasons and two Emmy nominations in the process. A return to film stardom, however, would eclipse her. Married and separated from record producer Lou Adler during her fun-in-the-sun years of the mid 1960s (they eventually divorced in 1980 after a separation of almost 14 years), Shelley found marital stability with actor/activist Mike Farrell of M*A*S*H (1972) fame, and became stepmother to his two children from a prior marriage. Following her recovery from a home accident that broke several ribs in 1998, Shelley was tested and diagnosed with severe auto-immune hepatitis, which resulted in a liver transplant in 2000. Thankfully, she survived the near-fatal ordeal and has been more heard than seen in recent years. She supplied the voice of \"Martha Kent\" on the Superman (1996) animated series but has done little else in the ensuing years.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODY4Nzc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDI3ODU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001193","name":"Shelley Fabares","idIMDB":"nm0001193"},"actorId":"nm0001193","character":"Martha Kent","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000233","main":true},{"actorName":"Roger Rose","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741648","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjA0MWU4MGUtZjU4ZC00MTczLTgyMTAtOTg2NmYxZjUyMjFkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIxNDgxOTc@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 August 1958","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","bio":"Roger Rose was born on August 15, 1958 in Chicago, Illinois, USA.
