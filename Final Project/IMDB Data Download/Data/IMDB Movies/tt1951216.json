Rising from a mind-reading act, Raymond grew to have a fabulously successful career as an erotica magnate that would make him the richest man in Britain. However, for all his material success, Paul's appetites mess up his personal life, such as alienating his wife with his philandering. Furthermore, even as he challenged his society's sexual mores, Paul's relationship with his daughter proves troublingly problematic as she came of age. While trying to be the best father he could, Paul gradually comes to realize that his proclivities have impoverished him in ways that mere money cannot address.","simplePlot":"The life of Paul Raymond, the controversial entrepreneur who became Britain's richest man.","actors":[{"actorName":"Jennifer Ellis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6147100","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jennifer Ellis is an actress, known for The Look of Love (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6147100","name":"Jennifer Ellis","idIMDB":"nm6147100"},"actorId":"nm6147100","character":"Fawn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Coogan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0176869","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMTU2NjcwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjczMzU4MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 October 1965","placeOfBirth":" Middleton, Manchester, England, UK","birthName":"Stephen John Coogan","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Steve Coogan was born on October 14, 1965 in Middleton, Manchester, England as Stephen John Coogan.

Famous for his public declaration of celibacy in the \"Tatler\" back in the 1980s, Emma Thompson has characterised her friend as \"90 percent gay, 10 percent other.\" Stephen Fry was born in Hampstead, London, to Marianne Eve (Newman) and Alan Fry, a physicist and inventor. His maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants, while his father's family was of English background. He grew up in Norfolk and attended Uppingham School and Stout's Hill. After his notorious three months in Pucklechurch prison for credit card fraud, he attended Queens College, Cambridge in 1979, finishing with a 2:1 in English in 1981/2. While at Cambridge, he was a member of the Cherubs drinking club, and Footlights with Thompson, Tony Slattery, Martin Bergman, and Hugh Laurie (to whom he was introduced by E.T.). His prolific writing partnership with Laurie began in 1981 with resulting Footlights revues for (among others) Mayweek, Edinburgh Festival, and a three month tour of Australia. In 1984, Fry was engaged to do the rewrite of the Noel Gay musical \"Me and My Girl,\" which made him a millionaire before the age of 30. It also earned him a nomination for a Tony award in 1987. (Sidenote: It was upon SF's suggestion that Emma Thompson landed a leading role in the London cast of this show.) Throughout the 1980s, Fry did a huge amount of television and radio work, as well as writing for newspapers (e.g. a weekly column in the \"Daily Telegraph\") and magazines (e.g. articles for \"Arena\"). He is probably best known for his television roles in Black-Adder II (1986) and Jeeves and Wooster (1990). His support of the Terence Higgins Trust through events such as the first \"Hysteria\" benefit, as well as numerous other charity efforts, are probably those works of which he is most proud. Fry's acting career has not been limited to films and television. He had successful runs in Alan Bennett's \"Forty Years On,\" Simon Gray's \"The Common Pursuit\" with John Sessions, Rik Mayall, John Gordon Sinclair, and others. Michael Frayn's \"Look Look\" and Gray's \"Cell Mates\" were less successful for both Fry and their playwrights, the latter not helped by his walking out of the play after only a couple of weeks. Fry has published four novels as well as a collection of his radio and journalistic miscellanea. He has recorded audiotapes of his novels (an unabridged version of \"The Liar\" was released in 1995), as well as many other works for both adults and children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTEyNzc0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQwNDk0NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000410","name":"Stephen Fry","idIMDB":"nm0000410"},"actorId":"nm0000410","character":"Barrister","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Raymond Waring","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912264","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 July 1977","placeOfBirth":" Bootle, Liverpool, England, UK","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Raymond Waring was born on July 21, 1977 in Bootle, Liverpool, England.

He then enjoyed further success with a recurring role on the ITV series Children's Ward (1989). O'Brien continued acting into his adulthood, appearing regularly in Coronation Street (1960) and Cracker (1993). In 1999, he appeared in a full-frontal nude scene in Virtual Sexuality (1999). He appeared nude again in Burn It (2003) and then starred in 9 Songs (2004), a film by Michael Winterbottom which would push the boundaries of just how explicit a mainstream feature could be. Winterbottom knew O'Brien was the perfect casting opposite American model Margo Stilley, as he was a young actor both confident and well-endowed. He was required to be seen with a full erection, receiving a footjob from Stilley in a bath, performing vaginal sex with her and receiving oral sex from her. He also became the first mainstream British actor to be seen ejaculating on screen, while Stilley masturbated him, in a scene which was left uncut by the censors. Although O'Brien's role in such a controversial and groundbreaking sexually explicit film seems likely to be what people will always identify him with, he has continued to act, mainly in supporting roles on British television.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDM5NDA1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA2NjM3ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639659","name":"Kieran O'Brien","idIMDB":"nm0639659"},"actorId":"nm0639659","character":"Jimmy Humphries","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shirley Henderson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376602","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNjAyNTY0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzMzNTMz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" Kincardine, Fife, Scotland, UK","height":"5' 0½\" (1.54 m)","bio":"The eldest of three sisters, Shirley Henderson was born into a working-class family in the village of Kincardine in Fife, Scotland.

She entered and won a talent competition at Butlins Holiday Camp and from there graduated to local music club gigs. She was later accepted by London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
