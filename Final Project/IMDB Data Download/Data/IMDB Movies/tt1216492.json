She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry. Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as \"Brigadoon\" and \"A Chorus Line\". It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work. Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Belles à mourir (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Cruel Intentions (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"Kathryn Merteuil\". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, Dr. Vegas (2004). Her role in the low-budget independent film Junebug (2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of \"Giselle\" in the animated/live-action feature film, Enchanted (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Adams next appeared in the major production, Charlie Wilson's War (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Sunshine Cleaning (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as \"Sister James\" in Doubt (2008) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as Amelia Earhart in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in Julie & Julia (2009). In the early 2010s, she starred with Jason Segel in The Muppets (2011), with Philip Seymour Hoffman in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012), and alongside Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in Trouble with the Curve (2012). She played reporter Lois Lane in Man of Steel (2013) and con artist Sydney Prosser in American Hustle (2013), before portraying real-life artist Margaret Keane in Tim Burton's biopic Big Eyes (2014). In 2016, she reprised her role as Lane in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and headlined Denis Villeneuve's science fiction drama Arrival (2016) and Tom Ford's dark thriller Nocturnal Animals (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjExMjI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc0MjY2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010736","name":"Amy Adams","idIMDB":"nm0010736"},"actorId":"nm0010736","character":"Anna","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0176490","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Goode","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0328828","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzY2NjE0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDkxMDY0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 April 1978","placeOfBirth":" Exeter, Devon, England, UK","birthName":"Matthew William Goode","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Matthew William Goode (born 3 April 1978) is an English actor.

He was born in Rochester, New York, to Sarah Jane (Price), an actress, and Arthur Washington Lithgow III, who was both a theatrical producer and director. John's father was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, where the Anglo-American Lithgow family had lived for several generations. John moved frequently as a child, while his father founded and managed local and college theaters and Shakespeare festivals throughout the Midwest of the United States. Not until he was 16, and his father became head of the McCarter Theater in Princeton New Jersey, did the family settle down. But for John, the theater was still not a career. He won a scholarship to Harvard University, where he finally caught the acting bug (as well as found a wife). Harvard was followed by a Fulbright scholarship to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Returning from London, his rigorous dramatic training stood him in good stead, and a distinguished career on Broadway gave him one Tony Award for \"The Changing Room\", a second nomination in 1985 for \"Requiem For a Heavyweight\", and a third in 1988 for \"M. Butterfly\". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion, and in the mid 1970s, he and his wife divorced. He entered therapy, and in 1982, his life started in a new direction, the movies - he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp (1982). A second Oscar nomination followed for Terms of Endearment (1983), and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife. As the decade of the 1990s came around, he found that he was spending too much time on location, and another career move brought him to television in the hugely successful series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996). This production also played a role in bringing him back together with the son from his first marriage, Ian Lithgow, who has a regular role in the series as a dimwitted student.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMzUyNDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMwNTU5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001475","name":"John Lithgow","nicknames":["Jiggles"],"idIMDB":"nm0001475"},"actorId":"nm0001475","character":"Jack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0188061","main":true},{"actorName":"Noel O'Donovan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233045","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Noel O'Donovan is an actor, known for Leap Year (2010), Far and Away (1992) and Le vent se lève (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233045","name":"Noel O'Donovan","idIMDB":"nm0233045"},"actorId":"nm0233045","character":"Seamus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0228429","main":true},{"actorName":"Tony Rohr","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0737575","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTczOTEyNzM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxMzE2Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Tony Rohr is an actor, known for Les Misérables (2012), Leap Year (2010) and The Double (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTczOTEyNzM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxMzE2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0737575","name":"Tony Rohr","idIMDB":"nm0737575"},"actorId":"nm0737575","character":"Frank","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0228430","main":true},{"actorName":"Pat Laffan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0480783","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MjY3NTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIxNjQxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Pat Laffan is an actor, known for The Queen (2006), Leap Year (2010) and My Left Foot (1989).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MjY3NTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIxNjQxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0480783","name":"Pat Laffan","idIMDB":"nm0480783"},"actorId":"nm0480783","character":"Donal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0117628","main":true},{"actorName":"Alan Devlin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0222752","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1948","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Irish Free State","bio":"Alan Devlin was born in 1948 in Dublin, Irish Free State.
