During that time, they lived as squatters in abandoned buildings. His mother taught him to read, and she also forbade him from seeing color movies. He grew up seeing silent and black & white movies at a local revival house and particularly enjoyed those of Charles Chaplin. His mother now lives in an ashram in Virginia. He began acting at Hampshire College and continued at the Yale University School of Drama in 1992.

Both his parents are of Greek descent. Elias attended Vanier College in Montreal before leaving to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in 1981, of which he is a graduate. He also attended the Actors Studio in New York City, where he studied acting under Ellen Burstyn and Peter Masterson. His film debut was in One Magic Christmas (1985). He has also appeared on stage in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" \"Bent\" and \"The Cherry Orchard.\" In 1989 he was nominated for a Genie (Canada's Academy Award) for best actor in Malarek (1988), a true story in which he plays a troubled street-kid-turned reporter for a Canadian newspaper. A somewhat of a breakthrough role for Elias happened in 1990, when he got the role of vigilante Casey Jones in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) and its sequels. He is one of Canada's most popular actors and frequently appears in films by Canadian directors Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg. It was Cronenberg's controversial movie Crash (1996) that had Cannes all abuzz in 1996. Elias played Vaughan, a self-appointed \"mad scientist\" with an unusual fetish--sexual delight in car crashes! The past two years have been busy ones for Koteas, adding six more roles to his resume. As Capt. James Staros, the commanding officer of Charlie Company in The Thin Red Line (1998), he brought sensitivity and compassion to his portrayal of a man who cared about the safety of his men--even at the risk of his own career. In 2000 he appeared in Lost Souls (2000), a thriller starring Winona Ryder, and starred on Broadway with Josh Brolin in the Sam Shepard play \"True West.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwMTEzODkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI1NDAyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000480","name":"Elias Koteas","idIMDB":"nm0000480"},"actorId":"nm0000480","character":"Charles Brunel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0455198","main":true},{"actorName":"Romola Garai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304801","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4ODg0NjAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI5MjgyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 August 1982","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong, British Crown Colony","birthName":"Romola Sadie Garai","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Born in Hong Kong to father Adrian (banker) and mother Janet (journalist), Romola Garai's unusual name is the female version of Romolo, an Italian name for boys (from Latin Romulus, the founder of Rome).

Harris started his career on the stage in the fringe theatres of London. He was a company member of The Union Theatre in Southwark. In 2000 he was cast in his first feature film, Paul McGuigan's Gangster No.1. His first breakthrough role came in 2006 with his performance in the multi award-winning and BAFTA-nominated feature film 'London to Brighton'. Despite being made on a tiny budget, the film received huge critical acclaim worldwide and was voted into Time Out Magazine's '100 Best British Films of All Time' with noteworthy actors and directors regarding Johnny's performance as \"outstanding\" and astonishing.\" In an interview in The Independent on Sunday at the time of the film's release, celebrated British director Shane Meadows said of Harris' performance in the film: \"It's an incredibly bold and massively powerful performance, the best I've seen on celluloid for a long time.\" Four years later, Harris' breakthrough role came when Meadows cast him in This is England '86 and his portrayal of Lol's abusive father in the show saw him receive both BAFTA and The Royal Television Society Award nominations for his performance. The following year he reprised the chilling role of Mick in This is England '88 with the show winning the BAFTA T.V award for 'Best Mini-series'. Johnny continued his run of award-winning projects with a leading role in the hit BBC drama The Fades, clinching the BAFTA T.V Award for 'Best Drama Series'. In 2012 he was back in our cinemas in Universal Pictures smash hit film Snow White and the Huntsman starring Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron. He played one of the eight dwarfs alongside the late Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, and Eddie Marsan. Another feature film soon followed and Harris was seen in the brilliant Welcome to the Punch with James McAvoy, Andrea Riseborough, Mark Strong, and Peter Mullan, which went on international release in 2013. Nev Pierce, Editor of Empire Magazine, has described Johnny as \"An heir to Oldman, in terms of being able to be both sensitive and scary, indelible and real.\" This year, in May 2015, Johnny has his first starring role in a big feature film in the eagerly anticipated, Monsters: Dark Continent. He'll play haunted and damaged U.S. soldier 'Noah Frater' in the follow-up to Monsters, Gareth Edward's international hit film of 2010. He is also starring in Fortitude, a new 12-part drama for Sky Atlantic/Pivot alongside Sir Michael Gambon, Stanley Tucci, and Christopher Ecclestone. The show was filmed on location in Iceland and London. Johnny's latest project is From Darkness, a new four part drama for BBC1. He'll play DCI John Hind opposite Anne-Marie Duff with filming taking place on location in Manchester and Scotland.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTc2MTU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY5NjQ4ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364890","name":"Johnny Harris","idIMDB":"nm0364890"},"actorId":"nm0364890","character":"Robert Irwin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0455197","main":true},{"actorName":"Goran Kostic","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1336552","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMjM3OTk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcwOTQ3MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 November 1971","placeOfBirth":" Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Goran Kostic was born on November 18, 1971 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia.
