He attended Valparaiso University near Chicago and studied acting with coach John Morley. He supported himself as a door-to-door salesman prior to breaking into the movie business. Clark began his cinematic career as an actor in several enjoyably lowbrow exploitation features for legendary Grade-Z director Al Adamson, giving a memorably offbeat performance as wacky drugged-out biker Acid in the splendidly sleazy Satan's Sadists (1969) (he also wrote the script under the pseudonym Dennis Wayne). Clark also appeared in Hell's Bloody Devils (1970) and the laughably lousy Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971) for Adamson. Clark has directed an entertainingly diverse array of pleasingly lowbrow low-budget drive-in pictures and straight-to-video offerings from the early 1970s to the late 1990s; they include the trashy blaxploitation double whammies Tom (1973) and Black Shampoo (1976), the silly Satan's Cheerleaders (1977), the nifty sci-fi/horror item Without Warning (1980), the amusing slasher spoof Wacko (1982), the hilariously raunchy Joysticks (1983), the uproariously awful killer mutant cat camp hoot Uninvited (1993), and the especially atrocious Skinheads (1989). In addition to directing, Clark often writes and produces his own movies and sometimes essays small roles in his films. He both wrote the script and pops up in a minor part in the fun supernatural revenge opus Psychic Killer (1975). His late actress wife Jacqueline Cole appears in several of his films.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163990","name":"Greydon Clark","idIMDB":"nm0163990"},"actorId":"nm0163990","character":"Jim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tom Johnigarn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424264","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 March 1942","placeOfBirth":" USA","birthName":"Thomas Johnigarn","bio":"Tom Johnigarn was born on March 29, 1942 in the USA as Thomas Johnigarn.

He attended the University of California at Berkeley, served as a US Navy frogman during WWII and saw action on Iwo Jima. While constable of Crockett, California, he drove his brother Guido to an audition for the film Saturday's Hero (1951). Director David Miller hired him for a small role as a cynical football player. Ray's husky frame, thick neck and raspy voice made him perfect for playing tough sexy roles. He was one of the reminiscing lovers in George Cukor's The Marrying Kind (1952) and starred opposite Rita Hayworth in Miss Sadie Thompson (1953). Ray was the none-too-bright boxer in Cukor's Pat and Mike (1952) and an escaped convict in 'Michael Curtiz''s We're No Angels (1955). His career started downhill in the 1970s, with him appearing in a string of low-budget films as a character actor. His last film was Shock 'Em Dead (1991). Ray was married three times, with one daughter Claire born in 1951 to his first wife Shirley Green whom he married on on 20 June 1947. Ray was then briefly married to actress Jeff Donnell and then had two sons and a daughter with his third wife, Johanna Ray, one of whom is the actor Eric DaRe. Aldo Ray died of throat cancer on 27 March 1991.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNjk5NDc0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ5NTUwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712731","name":"Aldo Ray","nicknames":["Rugged Romeo"],"idIMDB":"nm0712731"},"actorId":"nm0712731","character":"Lt.

At the University of Iowa, he was outstanding in swimming, basketball and football. When World War II broke out, he enlisted as a Marine fighter pilot and instructor. In Hollywood, he was a noted stunt man, doubling for Errol Flynn, John Wayne, and Gregory Peck. Gene Autry signed him for the lead in his 78-episode The Range Rider (1951) TV series. He tested to replace Johnny Weissmuller, as Tarzan but lost out to Lex Barker. In 1960, he played the heavy in Gordon Scott's Tarzan the Magnificent (1960), and his part there led Sy Weintraub to hire him as Scott's replacement. In his two Tarzan movies, he did all his own stunts. In Tarzan's Three Challenges (1963), he continued working in spite of dysentery, dengue fever and pneumonia. By this time, Weintraub was looking for a younger Tarzan, envisioning a future TV series. By mutual agreement, his contract with Mahoney was dissolved. After a couple of years regaining his strength and weight, Jock returned to making action films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE2OTI5ODkyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAwOTU5Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537146","name":"Jock Mahoney","nicknames":["Jocko"],"idIMDB":"nm0537146"},"actorId":"nm0537146","character":"Sgt.
