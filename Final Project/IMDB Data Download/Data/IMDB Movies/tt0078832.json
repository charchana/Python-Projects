It is one of the greatest spectacle that was filmed in Yugoslavia in the 20th century. In the spring of 1942, the German air force had complete dominance, not only in the sky of Yugoslavia, but also almost the whole of Europe. Partisans in Yugoslavia at that time had planes that are like other weapons snatched from the enemy. During the ''Third Offensive'', 1942, on planes of different types abducted by the enemy, these are people took unequal air battle, specifying the enemy blows where he thought he was invulnerable, thereby contributing to the final victory.
