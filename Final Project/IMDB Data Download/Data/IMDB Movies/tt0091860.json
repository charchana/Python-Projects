His unusual characters and personal projects have inspired a cult-like following that has dubbed him both madman and genius. The son of actor Bruce Glover, Crispin Hellion Glover was born in New York City and raised in Southern California. He picked up his father's trade while still in elementary school--by age 13, he already had an agent scouting out parts. A lead in a stage production of \"The Sound of Music\" (starring Florence Henderson) led to guest spots on the TV shows Happy Days (1974), Hill Street Blues (1981) and Family Ties (1982), which in turn led to roles in made-for-TV movies. The adolescent Glover felt \"confined\" by TV work, however, so he opted to stick to movie parts. He made his big-screen debut in the teen hi-jinx movie in My Tutor (1983), then followed up with a supporting role in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984). Glover's most defining Hollywood moment happened the next year, when he appeared as George McFly (Michael J. Fox's father) in the instant classic Back to the Future (1985). The underdog character struck a chord with moviegoers. Oddly enough, the actor delivered one of his favorite performances around the same time - playing a small-town kid obsessed with Olivia Newton-John in the indie The Orkly Kid (1985)--but the smaller film was completely overshadowed by his commercial success. Glover did, however, receive critical praise for his next indie role, a starring turn as a high-strung murder witness in River's Edge (1986). Glover and the producers did not come to a financial agreement for him to reprise the role of George McFly in Back to the Future Part II (1989). The producers brought the character back to life by splicing together archived footage and new scenes (using an actor in prosthetic makeup). Glover, who hadn't given permission for his likeness to be used, sued the film's producer, Steven Spielberg, and won. The case prompted the Screen Actors Guild to devise new regulations about the use of actors' images. In 1990 Glover teamed up with fellow eccentric David Lynch to play the maniacal Cousin Dell in Wild at Heart (1990). He filled the next decade with similarly quirky, peripheral roles, including a turn as Andy Warhol in The Doors (1991) and a cameo as a train fireman in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man (1995). His small but memorable appearances in films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) often outshone the main action. When he's not stealing scenes from Hollywood hotshots, Glover pours his considerable energy into other creative endeavors. He wrote his first book, \"Billow Rock\", before age 18, and since then he's gone on to create a library of peculiar titles (several of which have been published through his family's Volcanic Eruptions press). Among his most famous volumes are \"Rat Catching\" and \"Oak-Mot\", both Victorian-era stories updated with macabre illustrations and cut-up text. In 1989 he released an album of spoken word readings and cover tunes (including a rendition of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\") entitled \"The Big Problem [does not equal] the Solution. The Solution = Let it be.\" In 1995 Glover began shooting his directorial debut, What Is It? (2005), a surreal film populated entirely by actors with Down's Syndrome. He tours with the film and it's sequel It is fine. Everything is fine! and his show, \"Crispin Hellion Glover's Big Slide Show,\" which is a one hour dramatic narration of eight different profusely illustrated books. The artist in Glover has been said to be inspired by \"the aesthetic of discomfort,\" a theme which seems to have been carried over into an artistic public performance on David Letterman's NBC show in 1987, Glover emerged wearing a wig and platform shoes, then delivered a swift kick toward Letterman's head that prompted the producers to cut to a commercial. Late 2000 saw him hitting the multiplex with roles in Nurse Betty (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000), and the titular Willard (2003). He re-teamed with Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis as Grendel in Beowulf (2007) and has worked with Johnny Depp for the third time in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010). Other Glover projects loom on the not-too-distant horizon.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMDQ1NzE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1NjU4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000417","name":"Crispin Glover","idIMDB":"nm0000417"},"actorId":"nm0000417","character":"Layne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0024145","main":true},{"actorName":"Keanu Reeves","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxNDcwMTg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4NDYyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 September 1964","placeOfBirth":" Beirut, Lebanon","birthName":"Keanu Charles Reeves","height":"6' 1\" (1.86 m)","bio":"Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means \"cool breeze over the mountains\" in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu's mother is originally from England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career. After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Youngblood (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, River's Edge (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Dangerous Liaisons (1988) with director Stephen Frears. His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude \"Ted Logan\" in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard's comedy, Parenthood (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death (1990). Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix's narcoleptic male hustler in My Own Private Idaho (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Much Ado About Nothing (1993). In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and The Devil's Advocate (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and Chain Reaction (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure, The Matrix (1999). Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them The Replacements (2000), The Watcher (2000), The Gift (2000), Sweet November (2001), and Hardball (2001) - before The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003. Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Something's Gotta Give (2003), The Lake House (2006), and Street Kings (2008). He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008). And he's waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Thumbsucker (2005), The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009), and Henry's Crime (2010). Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronin (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Side by Side (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Man of Tai Chi (2013). In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film John Wick (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUxNDcwMTg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4NDYyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000206","name":"Keanu Reeves","nicknames":["The Wall","The One"],"idIMDB":"nm0000206"},"actorId":"nm0000206","character":"Matt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0024144","main":true},{"actorName":"Ione Skye","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001746","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTMyMzgxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMyOTc1MjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1970","placeOfBirth":" Hampstead, London, England, UK","birthName":"Ione Skye Leitch","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Ione Skye was born on September 4, 1970 in Hampstead, London, England as Ione Skye Leitch.

Up! Soon after Cavegirl, Roebuck established himself as one of the industry's youngest character actors with his haunting portrayal as the teenage killer, Samson in The River's Edge. Daniel Roebuck was born and raised in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, A fan of movies and television from a very early age he was immediately drawn to the actors and comedians. As his obsession with performing grew his parents unwittingly fomented his future by gifting him with a cardboard TV on his seventh Christmas. At the age of 10, he started performing in talent shows doing impressions of movie stars he loved. He joined a local circus two years later and made his debut as one of the youngest clowns in the country. Roebuck's clown act eventually segued into a magic act and he performed that throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. It was only a matter of time before Roebuck discovered the theater and from that point he never looked back. Over the next few years while still in Pennsylvania, Roebuck continued to hone his craft, acting in, directing, and even writing over 40 plays. He also began performing stand up comedy. Now, nearly 30 years later, Roebuck has amassed a substantial resume as an actor, writer and director. He has moved easily between all mediums having continued working on television, in movies and on the stage. His film credits are myriad, having starred in blockbusters like The Fugitive, US Marshals,and final Destination, as well as popular titles including Agent Cody Banks and it's sequel, That's What I Am, Money Talks, Flash Of Genius and so many more. Lately, Roebuck has enjoyed working in a number of horror movies - his favorite genre. He has collaborated with filmmaker Rob Zombie on Halloween, Halloween 2, Devil's Rejects, and Lords of Salem (as well as a commercial for AMDRO, the insecticide). He also appeared in Don Coscarelli's cult favorite Bubba Ho Tep as well as the director's Reggie's Tales and John Dies At The End. Daniel has also been a familiar face on television for nearly 3 decades, he was a regular for three seasons on the evergreen hit drama, Matlock, portraying attorney 'Cliff Lewis,\" the junior partner of the law firm headed by Andy Griffith's beloved character, 'Ben Matlock.' Interestingly, his landing the role was the fulfillment of a promise made several years earlier with his first appearance on \"Matlock\" in its inaugural season. At that time, Roebuck was told that Griffith had been so impressed with his work that he would be back as a regular on the show. It took five seasons, two more guest shots as different characters, and a change of networks, but Griffith kept his promise and Roebuck indeed became a series regular. He portrayed the irascible Rick Bettina on many episodes of Nash Bridges and in the fall of 2003 Daniel returned to series television as Pete Peterson, the gay owner of a local diner in A Minute With Stan Hooper. As a television guest star, Daniel has played countless characters. Some of his most memorable are a cop who literally turns into a pig on Grimm, a Romulan on Star Trek, Next Generation, a gun toting hostage taker on NYPD Blue, a cranky studio owner on Sonny With A Chance and a grieving father on Glee. He played other memorable roles on New Adventures of Old Christine, NCIS, Ghost Whisperer, CSI, Boston Legal, CSI Miami, Law And Order, Desperate Housewives and Hot in Cleveland. On the popular show, Lost, Roebuck portrayed the infamous Dr. Leslie Arzt, the aggravating science teacher whose explosive exit in the finale of the first season remains one of television's most surprising and talked about moments. He has starred in dozens of TV Movies. Perhaps his most famous turn was his critically acclaimed portrayal of Jay Leno in The Late Shift. He stepped into another pair of famous shoes when he played Garry Marshall in Behind The Camera; Mork and Mindy, The Unauthorized Story. Other Movies for television include A Family Lost, A Glimpse Of Hell, Murder At The Presidio, Shredderman Rules, A Borrowed Life, Quints and many others. Daniel's voice over work includes Christmas Is Here Again (a film he also produced),The Haunted World Of El Super Beasto and the groundbreaking video game, L.A. Noire. The theater remains Roebuck's first love and he has continued that passion in the Los Angeles area. He appeared in the world premiers of Sarcophagus and Crooks. He has also starred in No Time For Sergeants, Here Lies Jeremy Troy, Arsenic and Old Lace and The Man Who Came To Dinner among others. In 2006 Daniel founded THE Saint Francis Stage Company. Behind the camera, Roebuck has produced, written and directed/co-directed a number of documentaries including Halloween: The Happy Haunting of America and it's sequel as well as Goolians, Movieland Memories and a number of documentaries for the Monsterama series. Daniel has fulfilled nearly every dream of his childhood like appearing in Mad Magazine, becoming a toy and a Halloween mask and having his mug on a few trading cards. When not performing, Roebuck writes articles about Horror Movies, raises two children, teaches The Audition is the Job Experience and mentors young actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmZiMTBlYTAtMTBiOS00ZjczLTg4ZGYtODk0MmFlYTNlYjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0736263","name":"Daniel Roebuck","idIMDB":"nm0736263"},"actorId":"nm0736263","character":"Samson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0024147","main":true},{"actorName":"Dennis Hopper","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000454","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNTQ5Nzg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2MDE4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 May 1936","placeOfBirth":" Dodge City, Kansas, USA","birthName":"Dennis Lee Hopper","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"With an amazing cinematic career of more than five decades, Dennis Hopper was a multi-talented and unconventional actor/director, regarded by many as one of the true \"enfants terribles\" of Hollywood. Hopper was born on May 17, 1936 in Dodge City, Kansas, to Marjorie Mae (Davis) and James Millard Hopper. The young Hopper expressed interest in acting from a young age and first appeared in a slew of 1950s television series, including Medic (1954), Cheyenne (1955) and Sugarfoot (1957). His first film role was in Johnny Guitar (1954), which was quickly followed by roles in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Giant (1956) and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957). Hopper actually became good friends with James Dean and was shattered when Dean was killed in a car crash on September 30, 1955. Hopper portrayed a young Napoléon Bonaparte (!) in the star-spangled The Story of Mankind (1957) and regularly appeared on screen throughout the 1960s, often in rather undemanding parts, usually as a villain in westerns such as True Grit (1969) and Hang 'Em High (1968). However, in early 1969, Hopper, fellow actor Peter Fonda and writer Terry Southern, wrote a counterculture road movie script and managed to scrape together $400,000 in financial backing. Hopper directed the low-budget film, titled Easy Rider (1969), starring Fonda, Hopper and a young Jack Nicholson. The film was a phenomenal box-office success, appealing to the anti-establishment youth culture of the times. It changed the Hollywood landscape almost overnight and major studios all jumped onto the anti-establishment bandwagon, pumping out low-budget films about rebellious hippies, bikers, draft dodgers and pot smokers. However, Hopper's next directorial effort, The Last Movie (1971), was a critical and financial failure, and he has admitted that during the 1970s he was seriously abusing various substances, both legal and illegal, which led to a downturn in the quality of his work. He appeared in a sparse collection of European-produced films over the next eight years, before cropping up in a memorable performance as a pot-smoking photographer alongside Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He also received acclaim for his work in both acting and direction for Garçonne (1980). With these two notable efforts, the beginning of the 1980s saw a renaissance of interest by Hollywood in the talents of Dennis Hopper and exorcising the demons of drugs and alcohol via a rehabilitation program meant a return to invigorating and provoking performances. He was superb in Rumble Fish (1983), co-starred in the tepid spy thriller The Osterman Weekend (1983), played a groovy school teacher in My Science Project (1985), was a despicable and deranged drug dealer in River's Edge (1986) and, most memorably, electrified audiences as foul-mouthed Frank Booth in the eerie and erotic David Lynch film Blue Velvet (1986). Interestingly, the offbeat Hopper was selected in the early 1980s to provide the voice of \"The StoryTeller\" in the animated series of \"Rabbit Ears\" children's films based upon the works of Hans Christian Andersen! Hopper returned to film direction in the late 1980s and was at the helm of the controversial gang film Colors (1988), which was well received by both critics and audiences. He was back in front of the cameras for roles in Super Mario Bros. (1993), got on the wrong side of gangster Christopher Walken in True Romance (1993), led police officer Keanu Reeves and bus passenger Sandra Bullock on a deadly ride in Speed (1994) and challenged gill-man Kevin Costner for world supremacy in Waterworld (1995). The enigmatic Hopper has continued to remain busy through the 1990s and into the new century with performances in The Night We Called It a Day (2003), The Keeper (2004) and Land of the Dead - Le territoire des morts (2005). As well as his acting/directing talents, Hopper was a skilled photographer and painter, having had his works displayed in galleries in both the United States and overseas. He was additionally a dedicated and knowledgeable collector of modern art and has one of the most extensive collections in the United States. Dennis Hopper died of prostate cancer on May 29, 2010, less than two weeks after his 74th birthday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNTQ5Nzg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2MDE4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000454","name":"Dennis Hopper","idIMDB":"nm0000454"},"actorId":"nm0000454","character":"Feck","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0024146","main":true},{"actorName":"Joshua John Miller","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588679","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0Mjg4NDQyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzc3MjczMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 December 1974","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","bio":"Joshua John Miller was born on December 26, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, USA.

Didn't quite work out that way, and so, his hobby of Acting seemed to be the next course of action. He immediately set off for New York City, following graduation and a season of Summer Stock at America's oldest Summer Stock Theatre, Elitche Garden's Summer Theatre, in Denver. Tom, at the ripe old age of 17, wasn't quite ready to take the City and Broadway by storm, but he was about to have a real adventure starting off with his enrollment at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Robert Redford, was in his class but no one really knew he was at that time, and Tom was even less well known. After a year and a half at the Academy, he shifted gears and began studying at John Cassavetes Shadows Workshop, and Tom's first film work ever was in Cassavetes first film; SHADOWS, shot in 1957. Returning home to Denver each Summer, Tom married his first wife and had a couple of kids. Straight jobs were necessary to provide for a young family and after running the gamut of all kinds of employment endeavors, Tom broke into the field of Private Investigation and that became his calling card for the next 15 years. During that time, he divorced and later married his true love Ursula, with whom he is now celebrating 47 years of wedded bliss. They have 4 Grandchildren and a wonderful life in Los Angeles. Some 166 feature films and television shows later along with 87 or so theatrical productions behind him, Tom now splits his time between acting and producing. He's also been the founder of three legitimate theatre companies including the MET Theatre, which included such associates as James Gammon, Tim Scott, Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, Holly Hunter, and Pulitzer Prize winning playwright, Beth Henley. Film work has afforded Tom and Urs the opportunity of travel to such far off places as China, Morocco, Poland, South Africa, Germany and oo-la-la, Paris, France, the U.K., Italy and Canada. Still going strong, Tom just completed filming LIGHT OF MY LIFE; a movie written, directed and starred in by Academy Award winner Casey Affleck. \"We've just now returned from the 45th Anniversary Reunion of the Waltons and the 1 year Anniversary of Waltons creator, Earl Hamner's passing, which was held in Earl's home town of Schuyler, Virginia.

Rossi was born in 1947 in Trenton, New Jersey and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Leo first began acting in community theater. Although often cast as mean, loutish and despicable characters (he's portrayed more than his fair share of made Mafia guys as well as a substantial number of cops and government agents), Rossi has shown on many occasions that he can play more appealing and sympathetic roles with equal skill and conviction. Leo was solid as crass'n'crude sexist pig \"Budd\" in Halloween II (1981). He has appeared in several movies for director Jonathan Kaplan: he was excellent as Bonnie Bedelia's insecure, but basically decent husband \"Jack Muldowney\" in the wonderful Heart Like a Wheel (1983) and memorably chilling as the vile jerk who cheers on Jodie Foster's barroom rape in the acclaimed Les accusés (1988). Moreover, Leo has acted in three pictures for director William Lustig: very likable as antsy mob witness \"Frank DeSalvo\" in Hit List (1989), extremely engaging as eager beaver rookie homicide detective \"Sam Dietz\" in Relentless (1989) (Rossi reprised this part in three sequels and even co-produced the last two entries), and really funny as crazed serial killer \"Turkell\" in Maniac Cop 2 (1990). More recently, Rossi had a nice sizable supporting role as Robert De Niro's evil cousin \"Carlo\" in the hit comedy Analyze This (1999). Among the TV shows Leo Rossi has done guest spots on are ER (1994), Frasier (1993), Murder, She Wrote (1984), Tour of Duty (1987), 21 Jump Street (1987), Cagney & Lacey (1981), T.J. Hooker (1982), Amazing Stories (1985), Hunter (1984) and Hill Street Blues (1981).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1MTc1NDU0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk1NjMzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0744235","name":"Leo Rossi","idIMDB":"nm0744235"},"actorId":"nm0744235","character":"Jim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jim Metzler","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0582773","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxOTMxNTA2OTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDUxNzUxNjI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 June 1951","placeOfBirth":" Oneonta, New York, USA","bio":"Jim Metzler was born on June 23, 1951 in Oneonta, New York, USA.
