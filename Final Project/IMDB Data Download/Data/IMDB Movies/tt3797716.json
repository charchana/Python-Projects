For a number of years she played the violin and had lessons in piano and guitar. At the age of 16, she made her fist movie as a director. A few years later she got accepted to the School of fine Arts (HfbK) in Hamburg. There she made a few short films in the classes of Wim Wenders and Fatih Akin and she developed her writing skills. In order to finance her studies, she worked as a model, a bartender and she sold some of her paintings. In 2007 she received her directing diploma. One year later Fatih Akin told her that he wrote a part for her in his new movie \"Soul Kitchen\" and invited her to casting. After the audition she finally got the part ahead of several established actresses. \"Variety\" praised her debut by calling her \"the real discovery\". Next to Moritz Bleibtreu she plays \"Lucia\", the hard drinking waitress in the Restaurant \"Soul Kitchen\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNDY1NjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQxNjUxNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3341495","name":"Anna Bederke","idIMDB":"nm3341495"},"actorId":"nm3341495","character":"Kathrin Lüdinghusen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Devid Striesow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0834479","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MzkzOTkyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTgzNzI3._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 October 1973","placeOfBirth":" Bergen auf Rügen, East Germany [now Germany]","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Devid Striesow was born on October 1, 1973 in Bergen auf Rügen, East Germany.
