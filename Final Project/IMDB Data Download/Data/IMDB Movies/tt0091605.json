In 1988, Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables (1987). His film career also includes such films as Marnie (1964), The Name of the Rose (1986), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Highlander (1986), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), DragonHeart (1996) and The Rock (1996). Connery has been polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted \"Sexiest Man of the Century\". Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Euphemia McBain (née McLean), was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He has a brother, Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves. No Road Back (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it followed by several Tv-movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) and guest appearances on TV-series, and also films such as Hell Drivers (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), The Frightened City (1961). In 1962 he appeared in The Longest Day (1962) with a host of other stars. Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. He played the character in the first five Bond films: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), and You Only Live Twice (1967) - then appeared again as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, \"He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks\", and \"I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man,\" adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2\", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming's girlfriend told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No (1962) premiere. He was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels. Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film. During the filming of Thunderball (1965), Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately. Connery was forced to wear a toupee during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 17. This didn't prevent Connery from being cast in roles, although it became more noticeable in his later years. In 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled From Russia with Love (2005), which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast. After and during the success of the Bond-films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander (1986), The Name of the Rose (1986), The Untouchables (1987) (which earned him an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Rising Sun (1993), The Rock (1996), Finding Forrester (2000), and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963, he followed in his father's footsteps and also became an actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, they have no children together. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and his ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Quinn Connery, in 1997.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwNTM4MzctYjQzMi00NTA2LTljYWItNTYzNmE1MTYxN2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125","name":"Sean Connery","nicknames":["Big Tam"],"idIMDB":"nm0000125"},"actorId":"nm0000125","character":"William of Baskerville","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012172","main":true},{"actorName":"Christian Slater","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000225","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5ODA1ODY2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcwNDczNzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 August 1969","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Christian Michael Leonard Slater","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Christian Michael Leonard Slater was born on August 18, 1969 in New York City, to Michael Hawkins, a well-known soap actor, and Mary Jo Slater (née Lawton), a casting agent.

He has been married to Marina since 1995. They have one child. He has ultimately become one of the most popular choices whenever a Russian is needed in a TV-episode or a major movie production due to his ancestry and accent, best known for his roles in the films Air Force One, October Sky and Thirteen Days. He is known for the TV Show True Blue. Elya Baskin was born on August 11, 1950 in Riga, USSR [now Latvia] as Elya Zalmanovich Baskin, the son of Zalman Baskin and Frieda Baskin, a Russian Jewish family. He attended and is a graduate of Moscow's prestigious Theatre and Variety Arts College and won a Festival of Young Actors Award at the Moscow Comedy Theatre; Baskin was virtually assured of a successful career in the Soviet Union. About his choice of profession in the former USSR he said: \"In Russia, being an actor when it was still the Soviet Union was one of the most prestigious professions. It was like being a doctor here. You had to graduate from one of very few theatre schools, which were all four-year colleges. Without the degree, nobody would hire you. We worked very hard because we wanted to get through the four years and get the diploma, but after you graduate and go to the theatre, the actors don't work like actors work here. That's what fascinated me more than anything else here, how professional people were, how hard they worked, and how much harder it was to get work. In Russia we were always taught that we had the best theatre schools, but when I came here and started to work, I saw how wrong we were. You really have to be the best to get the part here.\" Then he built a formidable reputation on the European stage. Baskin immigrated to the United States in 1976 when pre-perestroika emigration rules were relaxed in 1976 and he came to Hollywood, although he spoke no English. About the change from stage to screen work, he said: \"In Moscow, theatre was my passion, my love, and I did very little television and film. Once I came here, I thought that because of the language barrier -I didn't know that you don't loop the films like we do in Europe- I'll try to pursue TV and films. For some reason I lost interest in theatre. Film work became so much more fascinating, the whole building of the character, no continuity, the whole camera aspect. Those are the things that really fascinated me. The language was the biggest challenge. Instead of concentrating on the development of the character, you're thinking about your mouth, about putting your tongue in the right position so people can understand you. I've worked for 20 years, and I will never be able to do a role in English like I would do it in my native tongue, and I know it. Of course, with the years it becomes easier, and more often than not I'm cast as a character with an accent.\" Tall, instantly identifiable Eastern European actor Elya Baskin fit the bill in Hollywood for ethnic character portrayals, especially characters with a Slavic background and an amiable demeanor; he also frequently exhibited a slightly zany undercurrent that became something of a trademark. About his being stereotyped casted, he said: \"I feel that, of course, I'm stereotyped. But what can you do? I can't imagine that some director would cast me as a sheriff from Alabama. But you can do exactly what you said: With every character, they're different people, and it's up to you what you do with them. This is your challenge. It doesn't matter how limited your piece of the pie that you can use, you always try to do the best that you can. How can I be upset for not being cast as a Southern sheriff? That's what you call acting; you try to utilize whatever you can to be a different person every time.\" He achieved his international breakthrough, however, at the hands of Hollywood giant Paul Mazursky, who cast him opposite Robin Williams as the clownish Russian circus performer Anatoly in the masterful serio-comedy Moscow on the Hudson (1984) where the actor's birdlike arm-flapping became one of the film's most poignant and memorable images. An additional collaboration with Mazursky followed, the 1989 smash Enemies: A Love Story; in the meantime, Baskin began to rack up a litany of roles in additional A-list projects, including 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), Vice Versa (1988), and Love Affair (1994). The Pickle (1993) re-teamed Baskin and Mazursky for a third occasion; unfortunately, it failed to match the critical or commercial success of its predecessors. Baskin remained in full flower through the end of the following decade, with a memorable comedic turn as Vladimir on the sitcom Mad About You and prominent roles in the big-screen projects Spider-Man 3 and The Dukes (both 2007). And, of course, he has continued playing guest roles in TV series like The West Wing, Alias, The Closer, Criminal Minds, Heroes and Cold Case. About being an actor, he said: \"This is the strangest, most dangerous, insecure, and wonderful life. I wouldn't choose anything else [other than this]\". He emigrated to the United States in 1976 and became a United States citizen on April 1, 1985. He is married to Marina Baskin since 1995. They have one child, a daughter named Michelle Baskin.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzk3OTU5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIxMDM5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0059946","name":"Elya Baskin","idIMDB":"nm0059946"},"actorId":"nm0059946","character":"Severinus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Lonsdale","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003909","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MDMwMTQxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgzMTg1Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1931","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Michael Edward Lonsdale-Crouch","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Michael Lonsdale was born on May 24, 1931 in Paris, France as Michael Edward Lonsdale-Crouch.

He was the youngest of six children. His father was the world-famous Russian Opera basso Feodor Chaliapin Sr.. His mother, Iola Tornagi, was a prima-ballerina who quit the stage after her marriage and became a caring mother of six children. Young Feodor grew up in a trilingual family environment. He received an excellent private education in Moscow, where he enjoyed the company of his father's friends, such as Sergei Rachmaninoff and Konstantin Korovin. After the Russian revolution of 1917, he and his father fled from Russia to Paris, France. Chaliapin Jr. got out from under his father's shadow after moving from Paris to Hollywood. There he began his film career, playing cameo roles in silent films. He created a niche for himself as an impressive character actor with excellent skills. His role as Kashkin, dying in the arms of Gary Cooper in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), was one of the finest moments in his early career. He played a variety of Russian characters in films made during and after the Second World War. Among the most memorable of his early works was his role as Fomich in Prisoner of the Volga (1959), directed by Viktor Tourjansky, also a Russian emigrant. After World War 2 Chaliapin moved to Rome, Italy. There he continued his film career as a character actor, from the 1950s-1970s. He played a broad array of very different characters, ranging from a comic gem as Sen. Torsello in the political satire The Senator Likes Women (1972), to a sinister Prof. Arnold in the horror film Inferno (1980). He returned to Hollywood and made a comeback in his later years. He really made his mark by playing the blind, murderous monk \"Jorge of Burgos\" in The Name of the Rose (1986). He is probably best known for his role as the loony dog-walking grandfather in Moonstruck (1987), living in a world of his own and greeting the Moon with his funny cries \"La Luna! La Luna!\" He also enjoyed a fine part as Leonides Cox, 'Robert De Niro''s father in Stanley & Iris (1990). His last notable role was as Prof. Bartnev in Le cercle des intimes (1991), based on a true story about people suffering in the Soviet Russia under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. In 1960, during \"The Thaw\" initiated by Nikita Khrushchev, Chaliapin Jr. saved his mother from the communist captivity and reunited with her in Rome, Italy. At that time, Iola Tornagi was 87 and had been granted permission to leave the Soviet Union. She left behind a magnificent art collection and a museum-quality home, built in Moscow by her famous husband. She could only bring her son an album of pictures of his childhood and youth in pre-communist Russia. 24 years later, Chaliapin Jr. took part in the returning of his famous father's remains from Paris to Moscow in 1984, which was also a result of reforms known as perestroika initiated by Mikhail Gorbachev. Chaliapin was allowed to visit Moscow in 1984 for the burial ceremony of his father, Chialiapin Sr., at the Novodevichy Monastery Cemetery. There he briefly rejoiced with his three sisters and other relatives around his father's tomb. Through his entire life Feodor Feodorovich Chaliapin Jr. was devoted to his mother, Iola Tornagi. She died in 1964, and was laid to rest in the cemetery of Rome. He died of natural causes on September 17, 1992, at his home in Rome, Italy, and was laid to rest next to his mother in the cemetery of Rome.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MDQ5NTAwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5NDk0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0149923","name":"Feodor Chaliapin Jr.","idIMDB":"nm0149923"},"actorId":"nm0149923","character":"Jorge de Burgos","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012174","main":true},{"actorName":"William Hickey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382676","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MTE3OTgwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg1NDgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1927","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"William Edward Hickey","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Son of Edward & Nora Hickey.

Her cinematographic career started via the filming of three French movies, namely Pierre Jolivet's Strictement personnel (1985), Luc Besson's The Big Blue (1988) and Jean-Jacques Annaud's The Name of the Rose (1986). Over the years, Vargas also worked with Samuel Fuller in Samuel Fuller's Street of No Return (1989), Miguel Littín in Los Náufragos (1994) and Alfredo Arieta in Fuegos (1987). Vargas is trilingual in Spanish, French and English. This has enabled her to pass without notice in films as varied as the cinematic horror film Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996) where she played the Cenobite Angelique, to the comedy Chili con carne (1999) of Thomas Gilou. She appeared opposite Jan Michael Vincent (Dirty Games (1989)), Malcolm McDowell and Michael Ironside (Southern Cross (1999)), and James Remar (The Tigress (1992)). After her performance in Bloody Mallory (2002) where she played \"Lady Valentine/Carmina Belladone\", she turned to playing roles for television. Initially she played in a version of Dangerous Liaisons (2003) directed by Josée Dayan. She starred in this production with Catherine Deneuve, Rupert Everett, Leelee Sobieski and Nastassja Kinski.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889926","name":"Valentina Vargas","idIMDB":"nm0889926"},"actorId":"nm0889926","character":"The Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ron Perlman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NzAzMTEyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYwMzYwNg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 April 1950","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Ronald Francis Perlman","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Ron Perlman is a classically-trained actor who has appeared in countless stage plays, feature films and television productions. Ronald N. Perlman was born April 13, 1950 in Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York. His mother, Dorothy (Rosen), is retired from the City Clerk's Office. His father, Bertram \"Bert\" Perlman, now deceased, was a repairman and a drummer. His parents were both from Jewish families (from Hungary, Germany and Poland). With a career spanning over three decades, Perlman has worked alongside such diverse actors as Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Dominique Pinon, Brad Dourif, Ed Harris, John Hurt, Jude Law, Christina Ricci, Federico Luppi, Sigourney Weaver, Michael Wincott and Elijah Wood to name a few. While he has never been a bankable star, Perlman has always had a large fanbase. He started out strong as Amoukar, one of the tribesmen in Jean-Jacques Annaud's Academy Award-winning film Quest for Fire (1981), for which he earned a Genie Award nomination. Perlman teamed up with Annaud again, this time as a hunchback named Salvatore in The Name of the Rose (1986). His first real breakthrough came later when he landed the role of the noble lion-man Vincent, opposite Linda Hamilton on the fantasy series Beauty and the Beast (1987). His work in this role earned him not only a Golden Globe Award but an underground fan following. Sadly the series was cancelled in its third season shortly after Hamilton's character's death. After that, he spent time doing supporting work on television and independent films such as Guillermo del Toro's debut Cronos (1993) (where a lifelong friendship and collaboration between the director and Perlman would blossom) as Angel and his first lead role as One in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's surreal The City of Lost Children (1995). His first real big role in a mainstream film came when Jeunet wanted him for the brutish Johner in his first Hollywood outing Alien: Resurrection (1997). Perlman has also used his distinctive voice to his advantage, appearing in many animated films/series, commercials and he is a video game fan favorite because of his work on such games as the Fallout series. It was not until much later he received worldwide fame when his good friend Guillermo del Toro helped him land the title role in the big-budget comic book movie Hellboy (2004). Del Toro fought the studio for four years because they wanted a more secure name, but he stood his ground and in 2004, after almost 25 years in and out of obscurity, Perlman became and household name and a sought out actor. Perlman has had one of the most offbeat careers in film, playing everything from a prehistoric ape-man to an aging transsexual and will always be a rarity in Hollywood. Other notable roles include the cunning Norman Arbuthnot in The Last Supper (1995), sniper expert Koulikov in Enemy at the Gates (2001), vampire leader Reinhardt in Blade II (2002), his reprisal of Hellboy in Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) and biker chief Clarence Morrow on the popular series Sons of Anarchy (2008). He currently resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Opal, and their two children, Blake and Brandon.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NzAzMTEyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYwMzYwNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579","name":"Ron Perlman","idIMDB":"nm0000579"},"actorId":"nm0000579","character":"Salvatore","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Leopoldo Trieste","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0872689","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 May 1917","placeOfBirth":" Reggio Calabria, Calabria, Italy","bio":"Leopoldo Trieste was born on May 3, 1917 in Reggio Calabria, Calabria, Italy.
