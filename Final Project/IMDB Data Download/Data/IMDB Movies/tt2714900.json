John goes through the massive quantity of negatives, describes how impressed he is by the quality of the images, becomes quickly determined they are not reverent to his project and just puts them away. That could have very likely had been the end of the story, if the power of the images had not pushed him to fall in love with photography. John confides that his photo hobby quickly motivated him to set up a darkroom and devote large amounts of time printing. As he learned more about photography, he recognized that those negatives he had bought, then stored, were the work of a real master. In an attempt to confirm his suspicion, he selected about 100 images and put them online with the hope that the feedback would confirm his judgement as to the strength of the images.","simplePlot":"A documentary on the late Vivian Maier, a nanny whose previously unknown cache of 100,000 photographs earned her a posthumous reputation as one of the most accomplished street photographers.","actors":[{"actorName":"Vivian Maier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6381264","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 February 1926","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Vivian Dorothea Maier","bio":"Vivian Maier was born on February 1, 1926 in New York City, New York, USA as Vivian Dorothea Maier.
