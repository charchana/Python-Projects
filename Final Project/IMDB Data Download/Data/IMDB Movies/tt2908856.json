Both cynical and at the end of his tether, he looks forward to selling the mansion house his late father owned in the Marais district. But what he finds out there just appalls him: his secretive dad had never told him he had acquired the property as a life lease, a typically French custom he never heard of. As a consequence, not only will poor Mathias be unable to sell the house into cash (at least as long as Mathilde stays alive) but he will have to pay the old lady a pension into the bargain...!","simplePlot":"An American inherits an apartment in Paris that comes with an unexpected resident.","actors":[{"actorName":"Kevin Kline","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000177","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMjcxMzMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQzOTQ4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 October 1947","placeOfBirth":" St. Louis, Missouri, USA","birthName":"Kevin Delaney Kline","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Kevin Kline was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Margaret and Robert Joseph Kline, who owned several stores. His father was of German Jewish descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. After attending Indiana University in Bloomington, Kline studied at the Juilliard School in New York. In 1972, Kline joined the Acting Company in New York which was run by John Houseman. With this company, Kline performed Shakespeare across the country. On the stage, Kline has won two Tony Awards for his work in the musicals \"On the Twentieth Century\" (1978) and \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (1981). After working on the Television soap Search for Tomorrow (1951), Kline went to Hollywood where his first film was Sophie's Choice (1982). He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. His work in the ensemble cast of The Big Chill (1983) would again be highly successful, so that when Lawrence Kasdan wrote Silverado (1985), Kline would again be part of the cast. With his role as Otto \"Don't call me Stupid!\" West in the film A Fish Called Wanda (1988), Kline would win the Oscar for Supporting Actor. Kline could play classic roles such as Hamlet in Great Performances: Hamlet (1990); or a swashbuckling actor like Douglas Fairbanks in Chaplin (1992); or a comedic role in Soapdish (1991). In all the films that he has worked in, it is hard to find a performance that is not well done. In 1989, Kline married actress Phoebe Cates.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMjcxMzMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQzOTQ4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000177","name":"Kevin Kline","idIMDB":"nm0000177"},"actorId":"nm0000177","character":"Mathias Gold","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0464641","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Burstin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6747483","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Michael Burstin is an actor, known for My Old Lady (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6747483","name":"Michael Burstin","idIMDB":"nm6747483"},"actorId":"nm6747483","character":"Rabbi on Bicycle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elie Wajeman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2716464","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Elie Wajeman is a director and writer, known for Les anarchistes (2015), Aliyah (2012) and Los Angeles (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2716464","name":"Elie Wajeman","idIMDB":"nm2716464"},"actorId":"nm2716464","character":"Man at Gate","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Maggie Smith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001749","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NzYxNjc5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTMzOTg1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 December 1934","placeOfBirth":" Ilford, Essex, England, UK","birthName":"Margaret Natalie Smith","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"One of the world's most famous and distinguished actresses, Dame Maggie Smith was born Margaret Natalie Smith in Essex.
