Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"Jean-René","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anna Mouglalis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609662","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTAzMjYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMzMzU0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 April 1978","placeOfBirth":" Nantes, Loire-Atlantique, France","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Anna Mouglalis was born on April 26, 1978 in Nantes, Loire-Atlantique, France.
