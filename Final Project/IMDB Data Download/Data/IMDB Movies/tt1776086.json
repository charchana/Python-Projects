Through Page's own words and interviews with her closest associates, we explore her extraordinary life growing up in a troubled childhood until she found a wild career as the Queen of the Pin-up Girls. In doing so, Page would challenge the paranoid sexual repression of the 1950s with uncommon grace until she walked away at the peak of her career. We also follow her quiet troubled later years struggling with unhappy marriages and mental illness that threaten to consume her even as she found a higher faith. Despite those challenges, Page's popularity would rise again in a more accepting time to become a celebrated icon of fearless sexuality and beauty.","simplePlot":"The world's greatest pinup model and cult icon, Bettie Page, recounts the true story of how her free expression overcame government witch-hunts to help launch America's sexual revolution.","actors":[{"actorName":"Bettie Page","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0656114","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMzIyMjUzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg4MDMyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 April 1923","placeOfBirth":" Nashville, Tennessee, USA","birthName":"Betty Mae Page","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Bettie Page's life was filled with cult myth, mystery and sadness. Her image captured the imagination of a generation with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality, during an era of strong sexual repression. She was the quintessential pin-up, tacked up on walls in military barracks and garages; five decades later, some feminists still hail her as a pioneer of women's liberation. It has been estimated that over 20,000 photographs of Bettie were taken, and new generations of fans still buy copies by the thousands. Born in Nashville, Tennessee to a part-Cherokee mother, she grew up in a family so poor \"we were lucky to get an orange in our Christmas stockings.\" The family included three boys and three girls, and Page later said her father molested all of the girls. He eventually stole a police car for a cross-country trip, was caught and sent to prison, and for a time Bettie lived in an orphanage. Her parents divorced when she was 10 years old. In her teens, Bettie acted in high school plays and was a straight-A student. She graduated from the Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville on a Daughters of the American Revolution scholarship in 1944, and went on to study drama in New York City. Her notorious career began one day in October 1950, while on a break from her job as a secretary in a New York office. On a walk along the beach at Coney Island, an amateur photographer admired the 27-year-old's curvaceous body and asked her to pose. Nudity didn't bother her, she said, likening it to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Her modeling career took off, and she was the centerfold in the January 1955 issue of then-fledgling Playboy magazine. In 1951, Bettie fell under the influence of Irving Klaw, a photographer. He cut her hair into the dark bangs that became her trademark, and posed her in spiked heels and little else. She also appeared as a performer in over 50 burlesque films. Her photos and films were publicly denounced by civic and religious leaders as \"perversion\", and Klaw was later arrested for \"conspiracy to distribute obscene material\" though the United States mail. Bettie was called to testify in a private session. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, her home state, even launched a congressional investigation against her. Believing that her days as a pin-up were over, Bettie retreated from public view, later saying she was hounded by federal agents. Her early marriage to her high school sweetheart had ended in divorce; she moved to Florida in 1957 and married a much younger man, but that marriage also failed, as did a third, and she suffered a nervous breakdown. In 1959, she was lying on a sea wall in Key West when she saw a church with a white neon cross on top. She walked inside and became a born-again Christian. After attending Bible school, she wanted to serve as a missionary but was turned down. Instead, she worked full-time for evangelist Billy Graham's ministry. However, a move to Southern California in 1979 brought her more troubles. She was arrested after an altercation with her landlady. Doctors diagnosed her as suffering from acute schizophrenia, and she spent 20 months in a state mental hospital in San Bernardino, and she was subsequently placed under state supervision for eight years. Her mysterious disappearance from the public eye only fueled the public's fascination. In fact, for two decades no one was sure where she was or even if she was still alive. She resurfaced in the 1990s after being tracked down for a documentary. She occasionally granted interviews and sold autographs, but refused to allow her picture to be taken in her old age. In a 1993 telephone interview, she told a reporter that she was \"penniless and infamous.\" She later hired a law firm to help her recoup some of the profits being made with her likeness. She spent her final years living in Los Angeles with her brother. After a three-week battle with pneumonia, Bettie Page suffered a fatal heart attack at age 85 on December 11, 2008.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMzIyMjUzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg4MDMyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0656114","name":"Bettie Page","nicknames":["The Girl with the Perfect Figure","The Notorious Bettie Page","The Queen of Curves","The Dark Angel"],"idIMDB":"nm0656114"},"actorId":"nm0656114","character":"Herself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hugh M.

Her father was Dutch-born and worked as a custom-furniture maker. Her mother was American-born, with Dutch and English ancestry, and was a teacher of English. Rebecca attended Berkeley High School where her nickname was the \"Jolly Blond Giant\", then she attended the University of California at Santa Cruz where she majored in Music, but left in 1995. She was a natural for modeling, and has posed for Sports Illustrated, Christian Dior and Victoria's Secret, to name but a few. Rebecca first met John Stamos in 1994, at a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and had her first date with him at Disneyland. They married in September 1998, but have since gotten divorced. Rebecca's favorite foods are fillet mignon, tuna sashimi and Häagen-Dazs Cappuccino Commotion ice cream. But to keep her weight at a svelte 130 pounds, she stays fit with a rigorous stretching and strengthening routine (her firm body tone is evident when compared to photos of her earlier modeling, where she was very slim but not toned). Rebecca's most famous movie role, so far, was as the shapeshifting Mystique in X-Men (2000), based on the long-running comic book series about teenage mutant superheroes (that Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created in 1962). To play Mystique every day, Rebecca had to start out nude, and then two female makeup artists would apply blue body paint and other stick-on parts for 8 hours a day. Rebecca told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) that things like tissue paper would stick to her hips; and, one day, the long hours of wearing sticky paint makeup made her so upset that director Bryan Singer told her to have a glass of white wine and relax. Notwithstanding those technical difficulties, X-Men (2000) was a box-office bonanza, and Rebecca's future in films was assured.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjM3MDg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIwNTExMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005381","name":"Rebecca Romijn","idIMDB":"nm0005381"},"actorId":"nm0005381","character":"Herself - Actress & Model","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Stacy Burke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102440","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 May 1975","placeOfBirth":" Rancho Cucamonga, California, USA","birthName":"Cathie Marie Charrette","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Stacy Burke was born on May 27, 1975 in Rancho Cucamonga, California, USA as Cathie Marie Charrette.
