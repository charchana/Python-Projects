His father was a Forensic Expert with The RCMP. Robb later went to high school with Mike Clattenberg and John Paul Tremblay. The three were always pulling practical jokes on people and getting into trouble. They had a bizarre sense of humor. While Tremblay and Wells were operating a successful chain of pizza restaurants called J.R. Capone's, they decided to pass the time making crude video skits of themselves. In 1998 they made a short film with acting veteran John Dunsworth called One last Shot. The film won a best actor and best cinematography award. A year later they made a mockumentary film called \"Trailer Park boys\" featuring newcomers Patrick Roach, Mike Jackson, Cory Bowles, Lucy Decoutere and Jeanne Harrison. During the filming, they met a sound mixer named Mike Smith, and after the filming was complete they made a deal with Showcase to make Trailer Park Boys into a TV Series with Mike Smith on board. After the series was green-lit, the lovable Bubbles was born. Now there are 3 main characters in the Park. Besides their day jobs as restaurant managers in Nova Scotia and as sound mixers, Wells, John Paul Tremblay and Mike Smith are Canadian TV icons to this day.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxMjU2NzA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYwMDYwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1036211","name":"Robb Wells","idIMDB":"nm1036211"},"actorId":"nm1036211","character":"Robb Wells","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0474475","main":true},{"actorName":"John Paul Tremblay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1033215","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNzY3MjI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg5MTMzMDE@._V1_UY44_CR8,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1968","placeOfBirth":" Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"John Paul Tremblay was born in 1968 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
