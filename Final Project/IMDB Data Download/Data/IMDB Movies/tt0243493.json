Young delinquent and wanderer in the past, Depardieu started his acting career at the small traveling theatre \"Cafe de la Gare\", along with Patrick Dewaere and Miou-Miou. After minor roles in cinema, at last, he got his chance in Bertrand Blier's Going Places (1974). That film established a new type of hero in the French cinema and the actor's popularity grew enormously. Later, he diversified his screen image and became the leading French actor of the 80s and 90s. He was twice awarded a César as Best Actor for Le dernier métro (1980) and Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), also received an Oscar nomination for \"Cyrano\" and a number of awards at international film festivals. In 1996, he was distinguished by the highest French title of \"Chevalier du Légion d'Honneur\". He married Elisabeth Depardieu in 1971, and they divorced in 1996; she appeared with him in Jean de Florette (1986) and Manon of the Spring (1986); their children Guillaume Depardieu and Julie Depardieu are both actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDU4OTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwODY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367","name":"Gérard Depardieu","idIMDB":"nm0000367"},"actorId":"nm0000367","character":"Félix Santini","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0101874","main":true},{"actorName":"Thierry Lhermitte","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0508293","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTA0NzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ4MzAz._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 November 1952","placeOfBirth":" Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, France","birthName":"Thierry Lhermitte","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"One of France's most popular actors, writers, and producers, Thierry Lhermitte has been appearing in films since the 1970s. Perhaps best known for work in farcical comedies, the tall, handsome actor has appeared in some of France's more outrageous films over the course of his prolific career. Born in Paris on November 24, 1952, Lhermitte began his career as one of the founding members of the comedy troupe Le Splendid. Among the troupe's other founders were Patrice Leconte, Josiane Balasko, and Michel Blanc, all of whom Lhermitte would collaborate with on future films. After his film debut in Bertrand Blier's Les Valseuses (1974) and a supporting role in Bertrand Tavernier's Que La Fête Commence... (1975), Lhermitte had his first screen collaboration with his Le Splendid colleagues, co-writing and acting in Leconte's Les Bronzés (1978). A farcical satire about a group of French tourists vacationing in Africa, the film proved to be phenomenally popular in France, inspiring a sequel the next year and a dedicated cult following. Lhermitte subsequently made his mark starring in a number of comedies, including Les Hommes Preferent les Grosses (1981) with Balasko, Jean-Loup Hubert's L'Année Prochaine...Si Tout Va Bien (1981) with Isabelle Adjani, and Blier's La Femme De Mon Pote (1983). He maintained a prolific work schedule throughout the '80s and '90s, continuing to play the romantic lead in comedies of every possible variety for a diverse array of directors. Lhermitte also continued to collaborate with his Le Splendid colleagues, starring in Leconte's 1993 Tango as a man intent on murdering his wife after she leaves him, and alongside Balasko in Grosse Fatigue, a comedy that featured Michel Blanc both directing and acting in a double role. In 1998, Lhermitte had one of his greatest successes to date as one of the stars of Francis Veber's Le Dîner de Cons. A witty comedy of manners, it featured the actor in top form as an arrogant publisher put in his place by the seemingly moronic man (Jacques Villeret) he has invited to his weekly dinner of idiots. One of the most popular films to be released in France in years, it was a phenomenal hit with critics and audiences alike. In addition to acting, Lhermitte has continued to work as a screenwriter and producer. In 1994, he wrote, produced, and starred in the children's comedy Un Indien dans la Ville; three years later he served as the associate producer for its American remake, Jungle 2 Jungle. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi Children: Victor Lhermitte, Louise Lhermitte, Astree Lhermitte-Soka Father: Andre Lhermitte","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTA0NzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ4MzAz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0508293","name":"Thierry Lhermitte","idIMDB":"nm0508293"},"actorId":"nm0508293","character":"Guillaume","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michèle Laroque","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0488477","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODg3ODk2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE1MTM1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 June 1960","placeOfBirth":" Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Michèle Laroque was born on June 15, 1960 in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France.

Born in 1930, he trained at the Paris Conservatoire but had to halt his studies due to military service. Relocating to Paris, he developed a minor name for himself in cabaret and stage plays. He also worked with the Grenier-Hussenot company at this time and acted in TV drama. Throughout his career Rochefort would return sporadically to the theatre as both actor and director. Films took his immediate focus in the late 50s and he became an audience favorite in roguish costumers and adventure films, particularly those of director Philippe De Broca, including Swords of Blood (1962), Up to His Ears (1965) and The Devil by the Tail (1969). By the 70s, Rochefort's reputation as a comedy star of sex farces and black comedies was firmly established, culminating with his classic roles in The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1972), Conspiratia (1973), Le fantôme de la liberté (1974), Affreux, sales et méchants (1976) and Pardon Mon Affaire (1976). He won the Cesar Award (French equivalent of the 'Oscar') for best supporting actor in The Clockmaker of St. Paul (1974) and the best actor trophy for Le Crabe-Tambour (1977). Though he branched out internationally in later years, he earned more kudos for his work in French-made films, especially those directed by Patrice Leconte: Tandem (1987), The Hairdresser's Husband (1990) and the Oscar-nominated Ridicule (1996). Most recently he won praise co-starring as a retired teacher of poetry opposite actor Johnny Hallyday in Man on the Train (2002). Despite his obvious comedic electricity, he has touched audiences as well playing dying naval captains, paraplegics, and timorous, elderly dreamers, often drawing both humor and pathos simultaneously from his characters. Not as well known by America's standards, his sunken, weary features, ever-searching eyes, ever-present moustache and prominent nose are unmistakable in the over 80 films he's graced. A lifetime dream was to play Don Quixote on film and his wish was nearly fulfilled until he took seriously ill and the project had to be indefinitely shelved after only a few days of filming. Rochefort received a special life's achievement Cesar award in 1999.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTY0MDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkxMTY1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734000","name":"Jean Rochefort","nicknames":["Mon petit Jeannot","Jeannot"],"idIMDB":"nm0734000"},"actorId":"nm0734000","character":"Kopel, the director","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alexandra Vandernoot","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0888824","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MTQxNjcxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTcyMDIzMjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1965","placeOfBirth":" Brussels, Belgium","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Alexandra Vandernoot was born on September 19, 1965 in Brussels, Belgium.
