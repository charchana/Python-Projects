As soon as she was seventeen, she was off to Paris with the ambition of beginning a career on the stage. She studied drama with Jean-Paul Denizon, actor and assistant to Peter Brook, before being admitted to the Ecole National Supérieure des Arts et Techniques du Théâtre, where she complemented her preparatory training with classes in fencing, dance, singing and masque. Hardly had she graduated than the cinema snapped her up. It was none other than Richard Berry himself who offered her her first important role in L'art (délicat) de la seduction. Theatre and film roles followed aplenty, leading up to L'Auberge Espagnole (Potluck or Spanish Apartment in English speaking countries), where her performance as the character Isabelle was a huge success with the public and earned her a prestigious César award for most promising young actress as well as the Prix Louis Lumière. Two years later the sequel, Les Poupées russes (The Russian Dolls), brought her a César for best supporting actress. The next Klapisch's movie, Casse-tête chinois (Chinese Puzzle), will be out on December 4, 2013 for France. On film Cecile de France continued to give her all with Alexandre Aja's horror movie Haute Tension (High Tension or Switchblade Romance in English-speaking countries). This gave her the opportunity to bring genre cinema into her repertoire, as well as to win the hearts and minds of the most demanding film buffs. Gilles Jacob invited her to host the legendary Cannes Film Festival in 2005. Cecile de France's unquenchable, vital passion for acting has found its truest expression when playing opposite such great performers as Gerard Depardieu (Quand j'étais chanteur; When I Was a Singer), Ulrich Tukur (Où est la main de l'homme sans tête?; Hand of the Headless Man), Kad Merad (Superstar) and Jean Dujardin (Möbius) or when working with such major figures of French film as Etienne Chatiliez, Daniele Thompson, Claude Miller, Cedric Klapisch, Claude Chabrol and the Dardenne brothers. Her American career, which was launched in Around the World in 80 Days alongside Jackie Chan, recently entered a new phase in 2009 with Clint Eastwood's Here After. Cecile is ready to live out all the forms of human passion and to embrace the most diverse forms of cinema, providing they are demanding, creative and stimulating. However, she has always maintained a special love for the theater, she will play in a new reading of Anna, a Serge Gainsbourg's musical at Lyon and Paris in few months.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzcwOTQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM0NTAwNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208426","name":"Cécile De France","idIMDB":"nm0208426"},"actorId":"nm0208426","character":"Marie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0043503","main":true},{"actorName":"Maïwenn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0494069","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE0Mjk0MjIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg5NzUyNQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 April 1976","placeOfBirth":" Les Lilas, Seine-Saint-Denis, France","birthName":"Maïwenn Le Besco","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Maïwenn was born on April 17, 1976 in Les Lilas, Seine-Saint-Denis, France as Maïwenn Le Besco.
