His mother, Betsy Franco, is Jewish, and his father, Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, was of Portuguese and Swedish descent, and ran a Silicon Valley business. James's mother, a writer, has occasionally acted. Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Whatever It Takes (2000). Although he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy. Next was Deuces Wild (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean (2001). He was recently seen in David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Nights in Rodanthe (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' In the Valley of Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyOTc0MjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgyODQwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556","name":"James Franco","nicknames":["Ted, Teddy"],"idIMDB":"nm0290556"},"actorId":"nm0290556","character":"Dave Skylark","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0449091","main":true},{"actorName":"Seth Rogen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0736622","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjgzNzcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExMDYxOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 April 1982","placeOfBirth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","birthName":"Seth Aaron Rogen","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"An actor, comedian and writer, Seth Rogen has come a long way from doing stand-up comedy as a teen. Rogen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Sandy (Belogus), a social worker, and Mark Rogen, who worked for non-profits. His father is American-born and his mother is Canadian. He is of Russian Jewish descent. He attended Vancouver Talmud Torah Elementary School and Point Grey Secondary School (although he dropped out of high school to move to Los Angeles) and was known for the stand-up comedy he performed at Camp Miriam, a Habonim Dror camp. At 16, Rogan came in second place in the 1998 Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest. Soon after that he landed his first role in Judd Apatow's short-lived but well regarded TV series Freaks and Geeks (1999), taking on the role of Ken Miller. Though the show only lasted one season, it was the launching pad for many careers, including Rogen, Apatow, James Franco, and Jason Segel. This early work sharpened Rogen's keen improvisational skills, which he's used on many projects since. Following Freaks and Geeks (1999), he participated in a few unsuccessful television projects, and then joined the American television version of Da Ali G Show (2003) as a writer during its second and last season, along with his childhood friend and writing partner Evan Goldberg. The writing team received an Emmy nomination. As a huge fan of the first season, Rogen was thrilled to get the chance to work with Sacha Baron Cohen. Continuing his work with Apatow, he joined the cast of Apatow's debut film The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) and is credited as co-producer. After that he took the lead in Knocked Up (2007), Apatow's second movie and a huge success. He's since been a frequent collaborator with Apatow, in projects such as Superbad (2007), Pineapple Express (2008) and Funny People (2009). He co-wrote Superbad (2007), with Goldberg; the pair started the project when they were teens. They won the Canadian Comedy Award for Best Writing in a Film in 2008. They later wrote Pineapple Express (2008) and The Green Hornet (2011), also starring Rogen. A talented voice artist, Rogen is in the animated films Horton Hears a Who! (2008), Kung Fu Panda (2008), and Monsters vs. Aliens (2009), and has voiced characters for The Simpsons (1989) and American Dad! (2005). Rogen was named the Canadian Comedy Person of the Year by the Canadian Comedy Awards in both 2008 and 2009. Rogen lives in Los Angeles with Lauren Miller, whom he met in 2004. They became engaged in September 2010 and married in October 2011.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjgzNzcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExMDYxOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0736622","name":"Seth Rogen","idIMDB":"nm0736622"},"actorId":"nm0736622","character":"Aaron Rapaport","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0449092","main":true},{"actorName":"Lizzy Caplan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0135221","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MDgxNDU0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk4NTgwMTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1982","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Elizabeth Anne Caplan","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Actress Elizabeth Anne \"Lizzy\" Caplan was born in Los Angeles, California, to Barbara (Bragman), a political aide, and Richard Caplan, a lawyer.
