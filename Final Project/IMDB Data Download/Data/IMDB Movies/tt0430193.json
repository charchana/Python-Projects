He has 2 loving parents named Raphael and Linda. He has an older brother named Jacob, and two elder sisters Kori and Shirley. David is a man of many passions and dreams. He has a love for helping people in the community whenever he can. His strive for greatness and excellence and drive comes from his father who instilled it into him. David went to a Hebrew school called Moriah until about the 4th grade, then he left Moriah in search of a school that can fit his needs. He found it at a school called Barnstable Academy. He learned that he had something he wanted to share with the world...his love for acting. He started acting at age 5 with his sister Kori in the King and I. Ever since then, he knew he wanted to become a professional actor, and has not stopped trying to achieve his dreams. Back at Barnstable David was a success in many variety shows and productions that the school offered. He took up singing, dancing, and acting. After graduating he went onto Fairleigh Dickinson University and received an Associates Degree in the Arts. He did not stop there, however, and continued to make it known to everyone who knew him that he was going to be acting for a long time and be famous and make a name for himself. He joined up with the Jewish Community Center's Teen Performing Arts Company in Tenafly, New Jersey. Since then he has done over 15 plays and musicals. Recently he was on MTV: Wannabe Eminem as a finalist and also appeared in two independent films, one of which, _Hope and a Little Sugar (2005)_, went to Sundance.
