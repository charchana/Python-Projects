He is the son of Elsie Lillian (Hopkins), a nursery school teacher and cook, and Robert William Hoskins, Sr., who drove a lorry and worked as a bookkeeper. Growing up, Hoskins received only limited education and he left school at 15, but with a passion for language and literature instilled by his former English teacher. A regular theatre-goer, Hoskins dreamed of starring on stage, but before he could do so he had to work odd jobs for a long time to make ends meet. His acting career started out more by accident than by design, when he accompanied a friend to watch some auditions, only to be confused for one of the people auditioning, getting a script pushed into his hands with the message \"You're next\". He got the part and acquired an agent. After some stage success, he expanded to television with roles in television series such as Villains (1972) and Thick as Thieves (1974). In the mid-'70s, he started his film career, standing out when he performed alongside Richard Dreyfuss in John Byrum's Inserts (1975) and in a smaller part in Richard Lester's Royal Flash (1975). Hoskins broke through in 1978 in Dennis Potter's mini TV series, Pennies from Heaven (1978), playing \"Arthur Parker\", the doomed salesman. After this, a string of high-profile and successful films followed, starting with his true major movie debut in 1980's The Long Good Friday (1980) as the ultimately doomed \"Harold Shand\". This was followed by such works as The Cotton Club (1984), Mona Lisa (1986), which won him an Oscar nomination as well as a BAFTA award, Cannes Film Festival and Golden Globe), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) (Golden Globe nomination), Mermaids (1990), Hook (1991), Nixon (1995), Le voyage de Felicia (1999) and Enemy at the Gates (2001). Hoskins always carefully balanced the riches of Hollywood with the labor of independent film, though leaned more towards the latter than the former. He worked at smaller projects such as Shane Meadows' debut 24 7: Twenty Four Seven (1997), in which he starred as \"Allen Darcy\". Besides this, he found time to direct, write and star in The Raggedy Rawney (1988), as well as direct and star in Rainbow (1995), and contributing to HBO's Tales from the Crypt (1989) and Tube Tales (1999). Suffering from Parkinson's disease in later years, Hoskins died of pneumonia at age 71 in a London hospital.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTE0ODQyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIyNTk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001364","name":"Bob Hoskins","nicknames":["The Cockney Cagney"],"idIMDB":"nm0001364"},"actorId":"nm0001364","character":"The Baron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0418265","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Modine","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000546","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MzQyOTM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg2Njk2OTE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 March 1959","placeOfBirth":" Loma Linda, California, USA","birthName":"Matthew Avery Modine","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"The youngest of seven, Matthew was born in Loma Linda, Ca, to Dolores (Warner), a bookkeeper, and Mark Alexander Modine, a drive-in theater manager.

She made her debut when she was only nine years old in Sergio Citti's Sogni e bisogni (1985). In 1988 she had the leading role in Cristina Comencini's first film, Zoo, l'appel de la nuit (1988), and was part of the cast of The Church (1989), directed by Michele Soavi. The following year she played Nanni Moretti's daughter in Palombella rossa (1989) (also directed by Moretti). It was with Close Friends (1992), written and directed by Michele Placido, that Asia's career really took off and she was able to move on from playing very young girls to more mature, complex roles. The movie was well-received at the Cannes International Film Festival. In Trauma (1993), she worked for the first time with her father, famed Italian horror director Dario Argento (her mother is one of Argento's favorite actresses, Daria Nicolodi, playing an anorexic girl in search of her parents' killer. The Phantom of the Opera (1998) is the third film she has made with her father, the others being Trauma (1993) (filmed in the US) and Le syndrome de Stendhal (1996). Asia's absorbed, intense style of acting was well-used in Giuseppe Piccioni's Condannato a nozze (1993). In 1993 she co-starred in Carlo Verdone's Perdiamoci di vista (1994) in which she played Arianna, a physically disabled girl--an intricate, difficult role that won her the David di Donatello for best actress (1993-1994). She also had a featured role in the international cast of Queen Margot (1994), directed by Patrice Chéreau. In 1995 she worked with Michel Piccoli in Peter Del Monte's Traveling Companion (1996), which again won her a David di Donatello and a Grolla d'oro. In 1994 Asia turned her hand to directing and turned out two short films: \"Prospettive\" (an episode of the film DeGenerazione (1994)) and \"A ritroso\". In 1996 she directed a documentary on her father and, in 1998, one on cult director Abel Ferrara, Abel/Asia (1998), which won an award at the Rome Film Festival. In 1999 Asia made her feature-directing debut with Scarlet Diva (2000), in which she was the leading actress and author of the screenplay. The film was released in May 2000 in Italy and the rest of the world. It won an award at the Williamsburg Film Festival in Brooklyn, New York. In 2001, after directing a number of music videos, she gave birth to her first daughter, Anna Lou. In 2002 she starred in The Red Siren (2002) by Olivier Megaton with Jean-Marc Barr and the action thriller xXx (2002), directed by Rob Cohen, with Vin Diesel.

He was the first-born child of Louis and Neva Dotrice who prospered as bakers. The Germans occupied the island in 1940 and he and his mother and brother escaped to England. Advancing his real age, Roy joined the Royal Air Force at age 16 and was trained as a wireless operator and air gunner. In 1942 his plane was shot down and he was captured where he served out the remainder of WWII (over three years) as a prisoner of war in Germany. He was introduced to the idea of performing when he took part in various makeshift concerts in order to raise the spirits of his fellow captives. Following WWII and his release, Roy decided to pursue his acting ambitions. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he began appearing in English repertory where he met and married (1947) actress Kay Dotrice who at the time was performing under her given name of Katherine (Kay) Newman. Throughout the early post-war years, the couple performed together in repertory with Charles Denville and the Denville Players. At different times he was a member of the Liverpool, Manchester and Oldham repertory theatres. Also during this great time of productivity, Roy produced and directed some three hundred stage plays. He formed his own troupe, the Guernsey Theatre Company, in 1955. The highlight of his theatrical career, however, began in 1957 when Roy became a member of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford, England, (later the Royal Shakespeare Company). For the next nine years he performed in a lengthy succession of the Bard's works, first in small parts as various players, officers and gentlemen. He subsequently went on to become a notable Iago, Falstaff and Julius Caesar, among others. A popular performer, he had an uncanny ability to play much older than he was. He later went on to perform with the American Shakespearean Festival. The notoriety he received from his abundant classical theatre experience led directly to radio, film, television and Broadway offers. Roy has appeared in a number of Broadway productions over the years, receiving a Tony nomination for his work in \"A Life\" and finally winning the trophy for his heralded performance in the 2000 revival of \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\" starring Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne. Known for his considerable success in one-man shows such as Abraham Lincoln, Charles Dickens, Will Rogers and Winston Churchill, his superb one-person show \"Brief Lives\", drawn from the Elizabethan diaries of John Aubrey, played for over 1,700 performances over a period of nearly a decade. At one time this set a record for a solo performance and was listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\". Dotrice made his credited feature movie debut supporting Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris in The Heroes of Telemark (1965), and has since lent class and distinction to a spattering of films. Among his list of credits include the bawdy comedy Lock Up Your Daughters! (1969); the sumptuous biopic Nicholas and Alexandra (1971); the Oscar-winning Amadeus (1984), Milos Forman's adaptation of composer Mozart's life in which Roy portrayed Mozart's stern and domineering father Leopold; and The Cutting Edge (1992) as an Olympic skating coach. Perhaps better remembered on the small screen, he appeared magnanimously as a host of monarchs including his Edward IV in The Wars of the Roses (1965) and King George IV in the syndicated miniseries Shaka Zulu (1986). To American audiences he is probably best known as Jacob Wells, the Beast's surrogate father, in the dramatic series Beauty and the Beast (1987). Dotrice was also cast in the recurring role of Father Barrett, a Catholic priest and confidante of Judge Henry Bone (played by Ray Walston), on the acclaimed Emmy-winning drama Picket Fences (1992). Since the end of the 1970s he has lived and worked primarily in America. More recently he appeared on stage reviving his outstanding 1993 role as George Bernard Shaw in \"The Best of Friends\" in 2006. His devoted wife Kay died on August 2, 2007, after 60 years of marriage. The couple has three daughters (Michele, Karen, Yvette), all whom at one time or another were actresses. Karen, who is now primarily out of the business, became the best known perhaps for her childhood Disney portrayals, notably in Mary Poppins (1964). Combined, his daughters have presented him with seven grandchildren.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEzMTk0NjE4MDdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDAwNTU0MDg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0234541","name":"Roy Dotrice","idIMDB":"nm0234541"},"actorId":"nm0234541","character":"Jay","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0418270","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Cortese","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181288","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTE5ODgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyMzU2NTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 February 1948","placeOfBirth":" Paterson, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Joseph Michael Cortese","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Mr. Cortese, a Jersey boy, received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theater/ Communications from Midwestern College in Denison, Iowa, where he studied theatre, under the guidance of his acting teacher Alfred Rusico.

Young was born on April 30 1940 in New York City, the son of a high school shop teacher. He is of Italian descent. Young received his dramatic arts training under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Young first gathered notice playing tough thugs in such films as The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight (1971), Across 110th Street (1972), Chinatown (1974) and The Gambler (1974). Fiery director Sam Peckinpah cast Young as the getaway driver / assassin, \"Mac\", in The Killer Elite (1975), and Young came to the attention of newcomer Sylvester Stallone, who cast him as future brother-in-law 'Paulie' in the 1976 sleeper hit Rocky (1976). The talented Young was nominated for an Oscar, and has gone on to reprise the role in all five \"Rocky\" sequels to date! Peckinpah re-hired him to play renegade trucker \"Pigpen\" in the moderately successful Convoy (1978) (watch for \"Pigpen's\" Mack truck where the writing on the door states \"Paulie Hauling\"!). Young has also appeared in numerous other major productions, including Il était une fois en Amérique (1984), The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984), Last Exit to Brooklyn (1989), Mickey Blue Eyes (1999) and The Adventures of Pluto Nash (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMDYzNjU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0OTI5MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949350","name":"Burt Young","idIMDB":"nm0949350"},"actorId":"nm0949350","character":"Murray","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0418276","main":true},{"actorName":"Stefania Rocca","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0733625","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzUzNDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDk3NDE2._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 April 1971","placeOfBirth":" Turin, Piedmont, Italy","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Stefania Rocca was born on April 24, 1971 in Turin, Piedmont, Italy.
