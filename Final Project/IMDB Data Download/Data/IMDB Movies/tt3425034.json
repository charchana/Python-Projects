They are too different in terms of character, life choices, worldview, and the way they relate to others. They are total opposites. However, they are overwhelmed by a mutual attraction they're trying hard to avoid; but to which they succumb to. This dramedy on relationships also gets a very credible performance from Paola Miraccione, who plays the tragic, albeit funny, character Egle.","simplePlot":"Elena (Kasia Smutniak) and Antonio (Francesco Arca) seem not to be made for each other.

She originally wanted to be a film critic but at 19 her interest in acting increased and she decided to attend several acting schools, including the \"Teatro Azione\" and the prestigious \"Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia\". She appeared in a TV commercial (directed by Gabriele Muccino), several music videos and short films, but her breakthrough came in 2007, when she was chosen by director Fausto Brizzi for the teen comedy and box office hit La nuit avant les exams 2 (2007), opposite Nicolas Vaporidis. The film was so successful that Vaporidis and Crescentini teamed up again six months later to shoot the thriller Béton armé (2007), in which for the first time, starring as a rape victim, she showed her dramatic talent; she received a Best Actress nomination at the Silver Ribbon Awards for this film. The following year she starred as Benedetta in Tell Me About Love (2008), in which she was directed by Gabriele Muccino's brother Silvio. Her excellent performance as a fragile and self destructive girl in the film brought her her first nomination at the David di Donatello Awards (the Italian Oscars). Always giving interesting performances (even in small roles, such as Anna in The Demons of St. Petersburg (2008)), Carolina Crescentini is undoubtedly one of the most talented young actresses that Italy has to offer at the moment.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyODk3MzI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM0NTY5Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1968793","name":"Carolina Crescentini","idIMDB":"nm1968793"},"actorId":"nm1968793","character":"Silvia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Francesco Scianna","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1150908","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NzA1NTUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDIxNjEzMDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 March 1982","placeOfBirth":" Palermo, Sicily, Italy","height":"5' 11¾\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Francesco Scianna was born on March 25, 1982 in Palermo, Sicily, Italy.
