His father introduced him to martial arts when he saw his son was physically weak. At the age of 12, Van Damme began his martial arts training at Centre National De Karate (National Center of Karate) under the guidance of Master Claude Goetz in Ixelles, Belgium. Van Damme trained for 4 years and earned a spot on the Belgium Karate Team. He won the European professional karate association's middleweight championship as a teenager, and also beat the 2nd best karate fighter in the world. His goal was to be number one but got sidetracked when he left his hometown of Brussels. In 1976 at the age of sixteen, Jean-Claude started his Martial Arts fight career. Over the next 6-years, he competed in both full-contact and semi-contact matches. He debuted under his birth name of Jean Claude Van Varenberg. In his first match, Jean-Claude was staggered by a round-house kick thrown by fellow countryman, Toon Van Oostrum in Brussels, Belgium. Van Damme was badly stunned, but came back to knockout Van Oostrum moments later. In 1977, at the WAKO Open International in Antwerp, Belgium, Jean-Claude lost a decision to fellow team mate Patrick Teugels in a semi-contact match. At the 1978 Challenge De Espoirs Karate Tournament (1st Trials),Jean-Claude placed 2nd in the semi-contact division. He defeated twenty-five opponents during the week long tournament, but lost in the finals to Angelo Spataro from the Naha Club. Later in 1978, Jean-Claude lost a 3-round match for the Belgium Lightweight Championship (semi-contact) to his fellow team-mate to Patrick Teugels. In 1979, Jean-Claude traveled to the United States of America, to Tampa, Florida. In his first and only match against a United States opponent, Van Damme faced 'Sherman 'Big Train'Bergman', a kick-boxer from Miami Beach, Florida. For the first and only time in his career, Jean-Claude was knocked to the canvas after absorbing a powerful left hook from Bergman. However, Jean-Claude climbed off the canvas and with a perfectly timed ax-kick, knocked Bergman out in 56 seconds of the first round. Jean-Claude was a member of the Belgium team which competed on December 26, 1979 at the La Coupe Fancois Persoons Karate Tournament which was sanctioned by the Federation bruxelloise de Karate. Van Damme's final match victory enabled his team to win the European Team Karate Championship. In Full-Contact karate, Jean-Claude knocked out England's Micheal Heming in 46 seconds of the first round. In 1980, Van Damme knocked out France's Georges Verlugels in 2 rounds of a match fought under kick-boxing rules. Jean-Claude wanted to defeat his rival Patrick Teugels. At the Forest Nationals in Brussels, on March 8, 1980, Jean-Claude knocked Teugels down and Teugels suffered a nose injury and was unable to continue. Jean-Claude was awarded a first round victory. Jean-Claude retired from martial arts in 1982, following a knockout over Nedjad Gharbi in Brussels,Belgium. Jean-Claude posted a 18-1 (18 knockouts) Kickboxing record, and a Semi-Contact record of 41-4. He came to Hong Kong at the age of 19 for the first time and felt insured to do action movies in Hong Kong. In 1981 Van Damme moved to Los Angeles. He took English classes while working as carpet layer, pizza delivery man, limo driver, and thanks to Chuck Norris he got a job as a bouncer at a club. Norris gave Van Damme a small role in the movie Missing in Action (1984), but it wasn't good enough to get anybody's attention. Then in 1984 he got a role as a villain named Ivan in the low-budget movie No Retreat, No Surrender (1986). Then one day, while walking on the streets, Jean-Claude spotted a producer for Cannon Pictures, and showed some of his martial arts abilities which led to a role in Bloodsport (1988). But the movie, filmed in Hong Kong, was so bad when it was completed, it was shelved for almost two years. It might have never been released if Van Damme did not help them to recut the film and begged producers to release it. They finally released the film, first in Malaysia and France and then into the U.S. Shot on a meager 1.5 million dollar budget, it became a U.S box-office hit in the spring of 1988. It made about 30 million worldwide and audiences supported this film for its new sensational action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. His martial arts assets, highlighted by his ability to deliver a kick to an opponent's head during a leaping 360-degree turn, and his good looks led to starring roles in higher budgeted movies like Cyborg (1989), Lionheart (1990), Double Impact (1991) and Universal Soldier (1992). In 1994, he scored with his big breakthrough $100 million worldwide hit Timecop (1994). But in the meantime, his personal life was coming apart. A divorce, followed by a new marriage, followed by another divorce. It began to show up in his career when his projects began to tank at the box office - The Quest (1996), which he directed; Maximum Risk (1996) and Double Team (1997). The three films made less than $50 million combined. In 1999 he remarried his ex-wife Gladys Portugues and restarted his lost career to attain new goals. With help from his family he faced his problems and made movies like Replicant (2001), Derailed (2002), and In Hell (2003) which did averagely in box office terms, but he tried to give his fans the best, his acting in those movies got better, more emotional and each movie was basically in different action tones.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2OTE1Njg4NjVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDAyNjU4MDM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000241","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","nicknames":["Muscles from Brussels","J.C."],"idIMDB":"nm0000241"},"actorId":"nm0000241","character":"Luc Deveraux / GR44","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012802","main":true},{"actorName":"Dolph Lundgren","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000185","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzEyNzU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg2MzM3MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1957","placeOfBirth":" Stockholm, Stockholms län, Sweden","birthName":"Hans Lundgren","height":"6' 5\" (1.96 m)","bio":"Dolph Lundgren was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to Sigrid Birgitta (Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Stockholm until the age of 13, when he moved in with his grandparents in Nyland, Ångermanland, Sweden. Despite an early interest in music and the fine arts, Dolph decided to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue an Engineering degree. After having completed his military service, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. It was in the military when Dolph first came in contact with the martial arts. Five years later, Dolph had become a World-Class competitor in Japanese Karate and was deeply involved with a discipline that was to become an important part of his life. After graduating High School, Dolph spent considerable time studying in the United States and abroad on various academic scholarships. He attended Washington State University and Clemson University in South Carolina. In 1982, he received a scholarship to complete his Masters Degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. In 1983, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, one of the world's top engineering schools. That same year, Dolph decided to move to New York City and take up acting. He started studying drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop in Manhattan, not knowing how quickly his life was about to change. Dolph's motion picture debut came in the \"James Bond\" feature, A View to a Kill (1985). However, it was his performance in Rocky IV (1985) later that year that definitely got him noticed. After a 9-month audition process among 5,000 hopefuls, he was cast opposite writer-director Sylvester Stallone, as his Russian opponent, \"Ivan Drago\". Following the success of Rocky IV (1985), Lundgren moved to Los Angeles and has since starred in more than thirty feature films. Lundgren portrayed the classic action-heroic lead in such films as Gary Goddard's Masters of the Universe (1987), Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991) co-starring Brandon Lee and Blackjack (1998), by Hong-Kong action legend, John Woo. Lundgren has also continued to turning in memorable performances as the main adversary to other action-stars, most notably in Universal Soldier (1992) opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by Roland Emmerich, as well as Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic (1995) opposite Keanu Reeves. In February 2004, Dolph Lundgren directed his first feature film, the thriller The Defender (2004), in which he also starred. In 2005, he directed and starred in yet another feature, The Russian Specialist (2005) (a.k.a \"The Russian Specialist\"). In January 2006, he finished principal photography of The Final Inquiry (2006), an Italian/American/Spanish co-production, directed by Giulio Base, in which he played against, amongst others, Daniele Liotti, Max von Sydow and F. Murray Abraham. In the fall 2006, Lundgren starred in Diamond Dogs (2007), a Chinese/American co-production filmed on location in Mongolia. In the Spring 2007, he directed a modern day western shot in Texas, Missionary Man (2007). In 2009, he completed two new directorial efforts, the action-packed Command Performance (2009), which showcases Lundgren's longtime musical talents as a drummer; and the neo-noir thriller The Killing Machine (2010). Lundgren also reunited with co-stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sylvester Stallone for Universal Soldier: Regeneration (2009) and the highly anticipated action blockbuster, The Expendables (2010). Dolph has managed to not let his Hollywood career stand in the way of his athletic background. He has been awarded his Third Degree Black Belt by the World Karate Organization in Tokyo. His accomplishments include being the Captain of the Swedish National Karate Team, as well as a Champion of the Swedish, European and Australian Heavyweight Division titles. Lundgren still regularly performs Karate exhibitions at international tournaments worldwide. In addition to his Karate expertise, Dolph was selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as the Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. Olympic Pentathlon Team during the Atlanta Games. He is actively involved in promoting the image of this sport. Lundgren's production company, Thor Pictures, is developing several projects in which he will produce, star and/or direct. He is also a founding member of \"Group of Eight\", a New York theater group started in 1994. Lundgren has also been working on a fitness book and sports wear line for men, the creation and launch of a new Dolph Lundgren brand, a licensing, media and publishing program and the development of future entertainment and media projects. Lundgren is married to Anette Qviberg-Lundgren, an interior decorator and fashion designer. The couple, along with their two daughters, resides in Marbella, Spain.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzEyNzU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg2MzM3MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000185","name":"Dolph Lundgren","idIMDB":"nm0000185"},"actorId":"nm0000185","character":"Andrew Scott / GR13","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012805","main":true},{"actorName":"Ally Walker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001824","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MjgxNTcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1MTY2NzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 August 1961","placeOfBirth":" Tullahoma, Tennessee, USA","birthName":"Allene Damian Walker","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Ally Walker was born in Tullahoma, Tennessee and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Actress Ally Walker studied biology and chemistry at the University of California Santa Cruz and went on to work for a genetic engineering firm in San Francisco. While spending a semester at Richmond College of the Arts in London, Ally became interested in theater but did not pursue it in lieu of her education in the sciences. After graduating with a science degree, Ally continued to work in genetic engineering, but her life changed one day when a producer discovered her in an L.A. restaurant and cast her in her first project. From that point on, Ally made her mark in both television and film, starring in daytime's Emmy-winning Santa Barbara (1984) and True Blue (1989), followed by the cult classic Singles (1992) and the action flick, Universal Soldier (1992). Ally then returned to TV, playing a private eye in the series Moon Over Miami (1993). It was during this time that Ally was offered the opportunity to test for both \"Rachel\" and \"Monica\" for NBC's Friends (1994), choosing instead to take on a different type of comedic role in the film Steal Big Steal Little (1995), starring alongside Andy Garcia and directed by Andrew Davis. Although Walker has appeared in a number of big screen films, she is popularly remembered as \"Ashley Bartlett Bacon\", Peter Gallagher's girlfriend in While You Were Sleeping (1995). Her most notable role however, was that of \"Dr. Samantha Waters\" in Profiler (1996), where she played a forensic psychologist with a dark past. The show was a pioneer in what is now the forensic drama phenomenon, and combined the standard \"whodunit\" with an intuitive/psychic twist which changes the landscape of television. Many credit Profiler (1996) with paving the way for hit shows such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), Medium (2005) and The Mentalist (2008). At the time, Walker was the only single female lead on network television and it ranked in the top ten in worldwide syndication for several years that followed its run. Some have compared Ally to Leigh Anne Tuohy, who was portrayed by Sandra Bullock in the film The Blind Side (2009), for making her documentary, \"For Norman...Wherever You Are\". Shot in 2005, it chronicles Ally's experience through the Los Angeles Foster Care System, a journey that she was inspired to take after helping a one-year-old baby and his mother get off the streets. The film exposes the errors in the system, but never loses sight of the fact that the system itself is necessary. This heartfelt project won Best Documentary Feature at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival, as well as the Champion of Conscience Award at Wine Country Film Festival. Ally returned to the small screen in HBO's \"Tell Me You Love Me\" (2007), a show that holds a special place in her heart. It was an honest depiction of people in relationships, filled with scenarios that were tender and raw. \"To explore intimacy in such an honest, brave way was a dream come true for me\", Walker says. \"I had been brought up on the films of the 1970s, and the material we were given on the show was sort of a throwback to a time when films were about people, not car explosions\". Ally also continued to be seen on the big screen, most recently starring in Toe to Toe (2009) and Wonderful World (2009), alongside Matthew Broderick. However, in a complete about face, Ally can now be seen as the sociopath, \"ATF Agent June Stahl\", on Sons of Anarchy (2008), FX's dramatic hit series. Originally cast for three episodes by the show's creator, Kurt Sutter, Ally has been recurring every year, and is now on her third season. Walker has supported the Environmental Defense Fund and CYFC - Children Youth and Family Collaborative, among many other children's organizations. She resides in Santa Monica with her husband, three boys John Walker, William, Caleb, and her three dogs - Flora, Daisy and Flower, 2 mutts and a Rottweiler.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MjgxNTcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1MTY2NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001824","name":"Ally Walker","idIMDB":"nm0001824"},"actorId":"nm0001824","character":"Veronica Roberts","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012803","main":true},{"actorName":"Ed O'Ross","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642522","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxOTkwNDEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc5OTgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 July 1946","placeOfBirth":" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Edward Orss","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Rough'n'tumble character actor Ed O'Ross was born as Ed Oross on July 4, 1946 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

He was an amateur Golden Gloves boxing champion and minor league baseball player prior to embarking on an acting career.

This African-American basketball player turned actor first popped up in minor roles such as a prison guard in Runaway Train (1985), as Andy Garcia's bodyguard in 8 Million Ways to Die (1986) and Powers Boothe's bodyguard in Extreme Prejudice (1987). \"Tiny\" Lister also had a stint in both the WWE (Formerly WWF) & WCW professional wrestling circuits in the late 1980s appearing under the name \"Zeus\" and \"ZGangsta\". His wrestling exploits can be seen on Summerslam (1989), Survivor Series (1989) and WWF Superstars (1986). However, unlike many musclebound athletic types, \"Tiny\" Lister is a reasonable actor, and he has managed to notch up appearances in over 80 movies, expanding upon his original \"fierce bodyguard\" roles to now include comedic and rather quirky performances in films such as Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), the African-American western Posse (1993), as the Federated Territories President in the science fiction epic The Fifth Element (1997), the cult comedy Friday (1995) and its sequel, Next Friday (2000). Lister has also recently appeared on screen with Adam Sandler in Little Nicky (2000), and with Mike Myers in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), plus he's been seen in a slew of B-horror films including Soulkeeper (2001), Hellborn (2003) and Dracula 3000 (2004). Tommy \"Tiny\" Lister may not be an A list star, but he is certainly one of Hollywood's most instantly recognizable and busiest character actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ODE4OTQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM4NzEzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001474","name":"Tommy 'Tiny' Lister","nicknames":["Zeus","The Human Wrecking Machine","Tiny"],"idIMDB":"nm0001474"},"actorId":"nm0001474","character":"GR55","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0435912","main":true},{"actorName":"Simon Rhee","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722223","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3NjM0NjIxNjReQTJeQWpwZ15BcmVzdW1l._V1_UY44_CR11,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 October 1957","placeOfBirth":" San Jose, California, USA","birthName":"Minhi Y.
