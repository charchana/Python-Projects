Now, he has become an expert in his field. Inspired by well-known directors such as John Carpenter and George Miller, this lover of Mexican culture and tradition has never ceased to expand his creative vision behind and in front of the camera. Without a doubt, the project which brought him the most recognition from Hollywood was the incredibly successful film. \"EL Mariachi\" where he participated as an actor and producer.
