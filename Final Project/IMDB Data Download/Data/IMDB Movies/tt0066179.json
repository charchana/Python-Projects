Robinson arrived in the United States at age ten, and his family moved into New York's Lower East Side. He took up acting while attending City College, abandoning plans to become a rabbi or lawyer. The American Academy of Dramatic Arts awarded him a scholarship, and he began work in stock, with his new name, in 1913. Broadway was two years later; he worked steadily there for 15 years. His work included \"The Kibitzer\", a comedy he co-wrote with Jo Swerling. His film debut was a small supporting part in the silent The Bright Shawl (1923), but it was with the coming of sound that he hit his stride. His stellar performance as snarling, murderous thug Rico Bandello in Little Caesar (1931)--all the more impressive since in real life Robinson was a sophisticated, cultured man with a passion for fine art--set the standard for movie gangsters, both for himself in many later films and for the industry. He portrayed the title character in several biographical works, such as Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet (1940) and A Dispatch from Reuter's (1940). Psychological dramas included Flesh and Fantasy (1943), Double Indemnity (1944), The Woman in the Window (1944)and Scarlet Street (1945). Another notable gangster role was in Key Largo (1948). He was \"absolved\" of allegations of Communist affiliation after testifying as a friendly witness for the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy hysteria of the early 1950s. In 1956 he had to sell off his extensive art collection in a divorce settlement and also had to deal with a psychologically troubled son. In 1956 he returned to Broadway in \"Middle of the Night\". In 1973 he was awarded a special, posthumous Oscar for lifetime achievement.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NzcwMzU5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTkwMjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000064","name":"Edward G.

He was the first-born child. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, and his mother was born in New York, to Russian Jewish parents. Martin caught the acting bug in high school where he participated in the drama club. After high school, he continued his interest in acting by attending Manhattan's progressive New School. When World War II broke out, Martin was called to service in his early twenties. After the war, he was lucky to secure a position as an usher at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. By 1947, he was honing his craft at the Actors Studio, run at that time by Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. His time at the Actors Studio in New York City allowed him training in the famous Stanislavsky method. Despite his excellent training, he had to prove himself, just like any up and coming young actor. He began on Broadway in the late 1940s. But, it was not until 1951 that he experienced real success. That play was Tennessee Williams' \"The Rose Tattoo\". After his Broadway success, he had a few minor television roles before his big break arrived when he joined the cast of On the Waterfront (1954). In the 1950s, Martin had many television roles. He had recurring roles on some of the most popular television series of that time, including The United States Steel Hour (1953), The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse (1948), Goodyear Playhouse (1951) and Studio One in Hollywood (1948). In 1957, he was able to prove himself on the big-screen once again, with a prominent role in 12 Angry Men (1957), directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda. All of Martin's television work in the 1950s did not go to waste. While starring on an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955), Hitchcock was so impressed by his work, that he offered him a key supporting role of Detective Milton Arbogast in Psycho (1960). His work with Hitchcock opened him up to a world of other acting opportunities. Many strong movie roles came his way in the 1960s, including parts in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Cape Fear (1962) and The Carpetbaggers (1964). One of the proudest moments in his life was when he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for A Thousand Clowns (1965). It was soon after that he began accepting roles in European movies. He soon developed a love for Italy, and lived there most of his remaining years. He acted in over a dozen Italian movies and spent his later life traveling between Hollywood and Europe for his many roles. After a career that spanned more than fifty years, Martin Balsam died of natural causes in his beloved Italy at age 76. He passed away of a heart attack at a hotel in Rome called Residenza di Repetta. He was survived by his third wife Irene Miller and three children, Adam, Zoe and Talia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwOTE4MjMxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc5MDg5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000842","name":"Martin Balsam","nicknames":["The Bronx Barrymore"],"idIMDB":"nm0000842"},"actorId":"nm0000842","character":"Stanley Pulska","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Diane Baker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000832","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMTgwNTc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQyODgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 February 1938","placeOfBirth":" Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Diane Carol Baker","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Actress with a notable career in films and television. Born and raised in Hollywood, she moved to New York at eighteen to study acting with Charles Conrad and ballet with Nina Fonaroff. She continued her training in Los Angeles at the Estelle Harman Workshop, securing a contract with Twentieth Century Fox. Baker's first film assignment was a true prestige picture: legendary director George Stevens cast her as Margot Frank, older sister of Anne, in The Diary of Anne Frank (1959). Baker remained at Fox as a contract player performing in films such as Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), The Best of Everything (1959) and Nine Hours to Rama (1963). After her contract ended, she worked on a pair of distinguished projects at Universal Studios: Mirage (1965) with Gregory Peck and Marnie (1964) for director Alfred Hitchcock. Baker was also a reliable performer in episodic television. She produced sensitive, affecting work in Rod Serling's touching Night Gallery: They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar/The Last Laurel (1971) and, in a colorful turn as an unstable dipsomaniac, in Columbo: Last Salute to the Commodore (1976). While continuing to perform, Baker moved into producing small, independent films such as ABC Weekend Specials: Portrait of Grandpa Doc (1977) with director Randal Kleiser and Never Never Land (1980) with Petula Clark, and larger projects such as the Emmy-nominated television miniseries adaptation of Barbara Taylor Bradford's A Woman of Substance (1984) with Deborah Kerr. More recently, she distinguished herself essaying the role of clan matriarch Rose Kennedy in the CBS miniseries Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (2000) and performed memorably with Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs (1991) as the distraught Senator Ruth Martin and, with Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick, in The Cable Guy (1996). In 2005, she acted with Frank Langella in the HBO series Unscripted (2005) directed by George Clooney. She also teaches acting courses in the School of Motion Pictures, Television, and Acting at the Academy of Art University, San Francisco.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMTgwNTc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQyODgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000832","name":"Diane Baker","idIMDB":"nm0000832"},"actorId":"nm0000832","character":"Peggy Pulska","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ruth Roman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0738746","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcyMDA1MjAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwOTgxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 December 1922","placeOfBirth":" Lynn, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Norma Roman","bio":"Ruth Roman was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, the youngest of three daughters of Lithuanian-Jewish parents, Mary Pauline (Gold) and Abraham Roman. Her father, a carnival barker, died when she was a small child, forcing her mother to support the family by working as a waitress and cleaning woman. Ruth grew up in the poor tenement district of Boston, Massachusetts, where she went to school. However, she left school after just two years to pursue an acting career. Her chosen path proved to be strewn with obstacles: in New York, she obtained a job posing for stills for a crime magazine, but theatrical work eluded her. She then worked as a hat check girl at a night club before calling it quits and returning to Boston. There, she made ends meet as an usherette during the day while at night performing with the New England Repertory Company, her first steady acting job. She also studied drama and eventually graduated from the Bishop-Lee Theatre School. Trying to get into films, Ruth unsuccessfully made the rounds of agents and producers for two years (1940-42), until a bit part as a WAVE came her way in the film Stage Door Canteen (1943). With $200 to her name, she purchased a one-way ticket to Hollywood, where she found shared accommodation with other aspiring starlets - naming it, optimistically, 'the House of the Seven Garbos'. After a screen test with Warner Brothers failed to result in a contract, Ruth had another run of six hard years playing bit parts, many of them uncredited, some ending up on the cutting room floor. A sole speaking part of consequence was in the titular role of Jungle Queen (1945), a Universal serial (after subsequent acting lessons, Ruth was aghast, when the serial was re-released in 1951). Ruth finally got her big break when producer Dore Schary cast her (against character, as a murderess) in the RKO thriller The Window (1949). That same year, she successfully auditioned for Stanley Kramer's boxing drama Champion (1949) as the dependable wife of the fighter (Kirk Douglas). After this turning point in her life, the shapely, smoky-voiced brunette secured a contract with Warner Brothers. During the next phase of her career, she moved effortlessly from glamorous and seductive to demure and wholesome, in films opposite stars like James Stewart, Errol Flynn and Gary Cooper. Look Magazine billed her as the 'Big Time Movie Personality of 1950', and by the following year she was receiving some 500 fan letters per week. While many of her leads were in westerns (albeit mostly A-grade ones), Ruth was somewhat more memorable in support of Farley Granger (as his upper-crust lover and the raison d'etre for the planned murder of his wife) in Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951). Another off-beat role was as a gangster's moll in the British-made updated Shakespearean adaptation Joe MacBeth (1955). As Lily, she is the power behind angst-ridden Paul Douglas ('Joe'), whom she easily manipulates to do her bidding. In The Bottom of the Bottle (1956), she was at her dependable best as the supportive wife of alcoholic Van Johnson. Arguably, her last noteworthy performance on the big screen was in Alexander Singer's romance/drama Love Has Many Faces (1965). By the 1960s, Ruth had made the transition to middle-aged character parts and began to appear mostly on television, in shows like The Outer Limits (1963), Mannix (1967), Gunsmoke (1955), and (in a recurring role) in The Long, Hot Summer (1965). She also toured nationally with theatrical productions of \"Plaza Suite\", \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" and \"Two for the Seesaw\". For the actress, who was said to disdain the trimmings of Hollywood stardom, real-life drama came when she and her son counted among the 760 survivors of the sinking of the luxury cruise liner 'Andrea Doria' in 1956. In September 1967, she jumped from her burning car, but still managed to make her scheduled performance in \"Beekman Place\" at the Ivanhoe Theatre. Ruth died in September 1999 at her home in Laguna Beach, aged 75.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjcyMDA1MjAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwOTgxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0738746","name":"Ruth Roman","idIMDB":"nm0738746"},"actorId":"nm0738746","character":"Lois","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Percy Rodrigues","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0735471","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NTcyMDMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAyNjg3MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 June 1918","placeOfBirth":" Montréal, Québec, Canada","birthName":"Percy Rodrigues","bio":"A symbol of intelligence, leadership and moral strength in his various 1960s and 1970s roles, African-Canadian actor Percy Rodrigues rose in Hollywood stature during the late 1960s following a couple of earlier Broadway appearances. The serenely handsome, distinguished-looking actor also became notable for helping to break racial barriers on television and went on to become a voice of great distinction behind the camera. The oldest of four children born to a Montreal couple on June 13, 1918 (some references list 1924 as his birth year), Percy was of African and Portuguese descent. His father abandoned the family while he was a youth and Percy started working as a teenager to help provide for his family. By his late teens, he had become a professional boxer and started scouting out acting jobs at the same time. He joined Montreal's Negro Theater Guild and although winning a Canadian Drama Festival acting award in 1939, found job offers scarce, prompting him to work as a machinist and toolmaker for the next decade or so in order to supplement his income. His distinctive, booming voice commanded early attention and he narrated several Canadian documentary shorts and appeared on television. He finally made his Broadway debut in middle age with Lillian Hellman's drama \"Toys in the Attic\" starring Jason Robards, Maureen Stapleton and Anne Revere. He followed that with a stronger role in \"Blues for Mister Charlie\" (1964) in which he shared the stage with African-American actors Al Freeman Jr., Lincoln Kilpatrick, Rosetta LeNoire, Otis Young and Tony nominee Diana Sands. This attention eventually led to film and television offers and he settled permanently in Los Angeles. From the beginning, he sought out dignified roles following Sidney Poitier's emboldening Hollywood ascension and became one of just a small vanguard of 1960s black actors who was able to circumnavigate around such restrictive and negative stereotypes throughout most of his career. With just a brush of grey at his temples, he applied and projected quiet authority and inner calm to his many roles. He broke into American television with episodes of The Nurses (1965), Naked City (1958), The Wild Wild West (1965), Route 66 (1960) and (especially) Star Trek (1966) (as Commodore Stone) before making big news in 1968 for his casting as a neurosurgeon during the final season of the popular nighttime soap opera Peyton Place (1964). Co-starring with Ruby Dee as his wife, it was a breakthrough white-collar role for a black actor in a series. In the same year, Percy had an excellent supporting role in the critically-heralded film adaptation of Carson McCullers tender drama The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968), in which he carried his own story line as an embittered physician at odds with daughter Cicely Tyson. Other imposing roles came his way in the form of detectives, mayors, commissioners, lawyers, politicians, scientists, captains, ambassadors, lieutenants and, of courses, doctors, which seemed to be a growing specialty. More interesting roles came with the mini-movies The Old Man Who Cried Wolf (1970), Ring of Passion (1978), Angel Dusted (1981) and Roots: The Next Generations (1979). He also had recurring roles on Sanford (1980), the one-season extended series of \"Sanford and Son\" (minus the son) that again starred Redd Foxx, and in Benson (1979), in which he played a judge. He continued to remain visible in the 1980s with episodes of The Fall Guy (1981), T.J. Hooker (1982) and Dynasty (1981), but after playing a doctor in the mini-movie whodunit Perry Mason: The Case of the Sinister Spirit (1987), Percy refrained from on-camera work and focused instead on his image as \"The King of Voiceovers\". Among his more notable vocal projects were his eerie voicings for the ads and trailers of the film Jaws (1975) and his narration of Michael Jackson's sci-fi musical Captain EO (1986) for Disney. Percy's marriage to his first wife Alameda produced daughter Hollis and son Gerald. Following her death, he married Karen Cook in 2003. He died of kidney problems at his Indio, California home on September 6, 2007 at age 89.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NTcyMDMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAyNjg3MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0735471","name":"Percy Rodrigues","idIMDB":"nm0735471"},"actorId":"nm0735471","character":"Frank Jones","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sam Jaffe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0415488","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Njk3NjgwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg2MjYxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 March 1891","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Shalom Jaffe","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Born Shalom Jaffe in New York City, he became known to the world as Sam Jaffe. From a Jewish family as a child he appeared in Yiddish theater productions with his mother, a well-known regional stage actress. He graduated from the City College of New York and then studied engineering at Columbia University graduate school. He began his career as a mathematics teacher in the Bronx. Around 1915 Jaffe joined the Washington Square Players. By 1918 he was no stranger to Broadway, having debuted in the original play Youth, and he appeared regularly through the 1920s, though less in the 1930s and only sporadically in the 1940s. He appeared in 21 plays on Broadway during his acting career, his final appearance in 1979. Jaffe was a method actor before it was defined and early on sported his signature shock of curly hair that some people would later misinterpret as part of some Harpo Marx characterization. Jaffe was anything but. His acting talents were considerable, and Hollywood noticed him first for the unusual role of the mad Grand Duke Peter in Josef von Sternberg 's The Scarlet Empress (1934). Frightening in his rendition of Peter, he was dispatched by the always magnificent Marlene Dietrich. Jaffe was no matinee idol but his homely features were made for unusual character roles. He did not disappoint in providing unforgettable performances. Frank Capra cast him as the mysterious High Lama in Lost Horizon (1937) (as last minute replacement; the actor originally cast had died). It would be another two years before Jaffe was once more called to Hollywood - he was back quite busy on Broadway. He appeared in George Stevens Gunga Din (1939) which sported big star names as well. Stevens gave Jaffe the lead, Gunga Din, native regimental bhisti (Hindi for water-carrier). It was probably Jaffe's most familiar film role. It was a standout part which Jaffe handled with great humanity, and the film was a huge hit. Jaffe would not appear in another film for eight years. His second of two movies in 1947 was Elia Kazan 's powerful anti-Semitic expose Gentleman's Agreement (1947) in which Jaffe played an Albert Einstein-like professor. Jaffe would play doctors of one sort or another in the handful of movies for the next few years. Then in 1950 he played a very different doctor - Doc Erwin Riedenschneider, criminal mastermind -- in John Huston's taut The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Jaffe would receive a nomination for a supporting actor Oscar for this effort. Of the three films he did in 1951, Jaffe also appeared in an Einstein-like role in the Robert Wise sci-fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951). Jaffe experienced the destructive anti-communist furor when his name was included on a listing of performers sympathetic to communism in the Red Channels pamphlet and like many, was blacklisted by the big Hollywood studios. He was considered essential by producer Julian Blaustein and Robert Wise to play Professor Jacob Barnhardt, and 20th Century Fox boss Darryl Zanuck (who had resisted much heat for Gentleman's Agreement (1947)) agreed. It was ironic that Einstein, veiled as the character Barnhardt, was a pacifist and being watched by the U.S. government at that time. There was some credence for rumors that Jaffe provided the calculus equations (mainly the gravitational force between bodies) on Barnhardt's blackboard - solved so easily by alien Michael Rennie. Jaffe didn't appear on-screen for seven years due to the punitive effects of the blacklisting. In 1958, John Huston wanted him for his very original The Barbarian and the Geisha (1958) with John Wayne, and director William Wyler also came forward later to cast him as faithful servant Simonides in the blockbuster Ben-Hur (1959). From then on Jaffe was very busy, especially with episodic TV through the 1960s which included his own recurring role as Dr. Zorba in the very popular Ben Casey (1961) series. Jaffe also appeared with his lifelong best friend, screen icon Edward G. Robinson in the made-for-TV film The Old Man Who Cried Wolf (1970) . Jaffe remained active into the year of his passing, a thoroughly engaging and unique actor and human being who never pushed his views on anyone.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Njk3NjgwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg2MjYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0415488","name":"Sam Jaffe","idIMDB":"nm0415488"},"actorId":"nm0415488","character":"Abe Stillman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Edward Asner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000799","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MDI4ODk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg3ODQ3MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 November 1929","placeOfBirth":" Kansas City, Missouri, USA","birthName":"Eddie Asner","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Ed Asner is a television legend, the winner of seven acting Emmy Awards (which puts him tied with Mary Tyler Moore, both of whom rank second to their \"Mary Tyler Moore (1970) Show\" co-star, Cloris Leachman who has nine).

Virginia was born in the small Iowa town of Stanton, which later converted its water tower to resemble a coffee pot in honor of its most famous citizen. When her family moved to Los Angeles, Virginia worked in radio while attending the University of California, Los Angeles. She was trained for a theatrical career by actor/director Fritz Feld, whom she married in 1940. In 1942, she signed a contract with Warner Bros. and started appearing in various films. Her first film was, Edge of Darkness (1943), in which she played a Norwegian peasant girl called \"Miss Olson\". Over the years, she appeared in prestigious films such as High Noon (1952) and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) - to horror in The Mummy's Curse (1944) and Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). She was a favorite of Stanley Kramer, appearing in a number of his films. But her greatest fame came in the 1960's when she started her 21-year stint as the matronly \"Mrs. Olson\", who always had comforting words for young married couples while pouring Folgers Coffee in the TV ads.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTFlNWFiZjktYzI0Ni00ZTY5LWE4MDYtYmZhMzYwYjY2OWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0160417","name":"Virginia Christine","idIMDB":"nm0160417"},"actorId":"nm0160417","character":"Miss Cummings","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jay C.

Flippen could probably be characterized these days as one of those distinctive faces you know but whose name escapes you while viewing old 50s and 60s movies and TV. His distinctive bulldog mug, beetle brows, bulky features, and silver-white hair were ideally suited for roles as criminals and rugged adventurers, while his background in vaudeville and minstrel shows helped him obtain roles in occasional fluffy slapstick and light musical comedy. Flippen was already a veteran performer on radio and the Broadway stage by the time he focused on film. He could be counted on to provide his patented gruff and bluster in many a action film whether playing a sheriff, prison warden, military high-ranker, bartender, or farmer. Moreover, his characters supported James Stewart in several of his standard vehicles, including Winchester '73 (1950), Bend of the River (1952), Thunder Bay (1953), The Far Country (1954), Strategic Air Command (1955), The Restless Breed (1957), Night Passage (1957), and Firecreek (1968). Dogged by illness but determined in later years, he continued his career in a wheelchair following a leg amputation. He was married for 25 years to screenwriter Ruth Brooks Flippen, whose work included a couple of Gidget movies. He died at age 72 of an aneurysm; which is a rupture of a swollen artery.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyMTc5NjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg4MTYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0282435","name":"Jay C.
