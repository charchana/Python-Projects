The amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to riches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia (Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise. Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Stay Hungry (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy The Villain (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980). What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan the Barbarian (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan the Destroyer (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - The Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller The Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), Predator (1987), The Running Man (1987) and Red Heat (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Twins (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular Total Recall (1990) and \"feel good\" Kindergarten Cop (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners. Remarkably, his next film Last Action Hero (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller True Lies (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Jingle All the Way (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Eraser (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of End of Days (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale The 6th Day (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Collateral Damage (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception. It was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date. Schwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children. In October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce. Schwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to The Rundown (2003), Around the World in 80 Days (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in The Expendables 2 (2012), The Last Stand (2013), Escape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator Genisys (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MDc4NzUyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQyMTc5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","nicknames":["Arnie","Austrian Oak","Conan the Republican","Styrian Oak","The Governator","The Running Man","Conan the Governor","The Machine"],"idIMDB":"nm0000216"},"actorId":"nm0000216","character":"John 'Breacher' Wharton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0405224","main":true},{"actorName":"Sam Worthington","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941777","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NTMyMjIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyNjYwMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 August 1976","placeOfBirth":" Godalming, Surrey, England, UK","birthName":"Samuel Henry J. Worthington","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Samuel Henry John Worthington was born August 2, 1976 in Surrey, England. His parents, Jeanne (Martyn) and Ronald Worthington, a power planet employee, moved the family to Australia when he was six months old, and raised him and his sister Lucinda in Warnbro, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Worthington graduated from NIDA (Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art) in 1998 at the age of 22. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of \"Arthur Wellesley\" in his first professional role in the Belvoir Street Theatre production \"Judas Kiss\" (directed by Neil Armfield). He then went on to work in Australian television on such shows as Brigade des mers (1996) and \"Backburner\" and then on the American TV show JAG (1995)'s 100th episode (Boomerang: Part 1). Worthington made his film debut in the highly acclaimed Australian movie Bootmen (2000), a film about a troop of \"tap dogs\". Minor roles proceeded in Hart's War (2002) and A Matter of Life (2001) before he was cast in another hailed Australian drama, Dirty Deeds (2002), co-starring Toni Collette and John Goodman. The following year, he starred in yet another Aussie film, opposite David Wenham in Gettin' Square (2003). The director of the film, Jonathan Teplitzky, originally tested actors who were up to 8 years older than the then-27-year-old Worthington. Teplitzky wasn't sure Sam \"could convincingly play a tough guy and also have elements of the leading man about him\", but in the end Teplitzky decided he was \"fantastic\", and had \"David playing the older, slightly more streetwise accomplice\" proclaiming \"it worked\". But it wasn't until 2004 that Sam got his big break. He was offered the starring role in Cate Shortland's acclaimed Australian drama Le saut périlleux (2004), opposite Abbie Cornish. The film made a clean sweep of the Australian Film Institute awards in 2004, winning in 13 film categories - the first time this has ever occurred in the award's history. Worthington also won the AFI award for Best Male Actor. Worthington's career took off internationally when he was cast as Jake Sully in James Cameron's Avatar (2009) and as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who assists the humans despite their suspicions of him in Terminator Salvation (2009). Worthington soon became a household name, and starring in high profile films Clash of the Titans (2010), The Debt (2010), Texas Killing Fields (2011), Man on a Ledge (2012), and La colère des Titans (2012). Worthington also provided the voice for the Call of Duty: Black Ops video games. In 2010, Worthington started a production company, Full Clip Productions, with two of his close friends John Schwarz and Michael Schwarz. The company teamed with Radical studios to print two graphic novels Damaged and Patriots.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NTMyMjIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyNjYwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0941777","name":"Sam Worthington","idIMDB":"nm0941777"},"actorId":"nm0941777","character":"James 'Monster' Murray","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0418842","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Manganiello","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0542133","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NTkyMDYyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkyNzc4OTE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 December 1976","placeOfBirth":" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Joseph Michael Manganiello","height":"6' 5\" (1.96 m)","bio":"Joe Manganiello is an American actor.

His parents, Barney and Martha Ware provided much love and support throughout his childhood and have continued to have a huge impact on his life. His parents and extended family offered many unique and wonderful opportunities to him, and he took advantage of as many as possible. At the age of 13 he learned to fly and by the age of 15 was working as a crop duster on weekends and summers. Before he had his pilot's license Tim and his cousin were able to start Mid-Georgia Crop Dusters with financial help from a family member. The company was in business for the next 30 years. He attended Marist School in Atlanta and went to Duke University on a tennis scholarship. At Duke Tim had double majors, drama and finance. Upon graduation he did a stint in the Marines. He then worked for his great uncle on his various business interests throughout Europe, Asia and Africa. Tim found the work was both fulfilling and exhausting. After four years Tim moved on. He became a firefighter for the City of Decatur Georgia and continued his crop dusting. Twice a month he would fly to New York where he studied under acting coach Uta Hagen. Several years later, with Uta's encouragement he began doing stage work. During a performance of God's Favorite he was seen by an agent and signed on the spot. He landed a role on his first audition, joined SAG, and has been acting ever since. Tim married his wife, Dee, in 1995 and shortly after they began working together in the wireless communication business. The tower business let him support his acting habit and over the past 30 years he has been in over 60 films and television shows. He has been seen as a recurring character in two series, CBS' Reckless where he plays Judge Abbott Garner; and on the Sundance Channel in Rectify as Dr. Perlmutt. Tim has twin daughters, a stepdaughter and son, and five blue ribbon, prize winning grand children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2MDY2NTc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM3MjIyMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912154","name":"Tim
