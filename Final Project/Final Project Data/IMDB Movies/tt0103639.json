The eldest of four children, Scott has two brothers and one sister. He spent the majority of his formative years in southern Florida, then moved with his family to Los Angeles when his career began to take off. Scott first became interested in acting in the third grade, when an actor gave a presentation for Career Day. He relentlessly pestered his parents to get him an agent until they finally realized that the young tyke was serious about becoming an actor. His first gig was a national commercial for Ideal Toys. In fall 1994, Scott left the LA scene to fulfill yet another dream--attending Harvard University. Taking leave of the TV series Full House (1987) didn't suggest he was leaving the business altogether. He continued as the voice of Aladdin (1992) in the Saturday morning TV series, completed two more full length Aladdin videos, and made a final appearance on \"Full House,\" all while maintaining excellent grades at school. As if all of that didn't keep the ambitious lad busy enough, he also held a part-time job as a youth correspondent for Good Morning America (1975). Scott majored in English and minored in French literature while at Harvard, and he graduated magna cum laude in June of 1998. In his first online interview after returning to Los Angeles, he still seemed to be undecided about what his plans were, which were narrowed down to writing, directing, acting, and news correspondence. Since his return to Hollywood, he has starred in a horror flick, Shredder (2003); produced an award winning film short called The Cricket Player (2002); and provided his voice for the English-language dub of Osamu Tezuka's Metropolis (2001), Disney/Square Co.'s video game Kingdom Hearts (2002), \"Mickey's Philharmagic,\" and \"The Search for Mickey Mouse\"! Scott considers himself to be a writer, primarily, and an actor, secondarily. He received his first writing credit on the WB television show Like Family (2003), which is described as a \"multi-ethnic crossover comedy about two very different families coming together under one roof.\" Recently, he received a credit as a co-writer for another WB sitcom, What I Like About You (2002)","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NzE4MjYyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0918334","name":"Scott Weinger","idIMDB":"nm0918334"},"actorId":"nm0918334","character":"Aladdin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000538","main":true},{"actorName":"Robin Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYzMjc2Mjg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc1OTQwNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 July 1951","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Robin McLaurin Williams","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Robin McLaurin Williams was born on Saturday, July 21st, 1951, in Chicago, Illinois, a great-great-grandson of Mississippi Governor and Senator, Anselm J.

After spending several years mastering the art of stand-up comedy, producers of the legendary NBC late-night comedy show, Saturday Night Live (1975), became aware of Gottfried and, in 1980, hired him as a cast member. It wasn't until a few years later when his true notoriety would begin when MTV hired him for a series of improvised and hilarious promos for the newly formed channel. This led to several television appearances on The Cosby Show (1984) and Late Night with David Letterman (1982). Gottfried's work in television soon led to roles in film. Most notable was his improvised scene as business manager \"Sidney Bernstein\" in the hit sequel, Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), for which the New York Daily News said that \"Gilbert Gottfried steals the picture with a single scene\". Aside from his glowing reputation in comedy clubs, Gottfried began to gain a reputation as the king of quirky roles in both movies and television. He appeared in such movies as Problem Child (1990), Problem Child 2 (1991), Look Who's Talking Too (1990) and The Adventures of Ford Fairlane (1990). He was also the host of the very popular late night movie series, Up All Night (1989). After his stellar performance as the wise cracking parrot, \"Iago\", in the Disney classic, Aladdin (1992), Gottfried became one of the most recognizable voice-over talents. His signature voice can be heard in several commercials, cartoons and movies, including the frustrated duck in the AFLAC Insurance commercials. Gottfried also is the voice of \"Digit\" in the long- running PBS Series, Cybermatt (2002). Gottfried has been a regular on the new Hollywood Squares (1998) and is a frequent guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) and Howard Stern on Demand (2005). Gottfried recently appeared in the hit comedy documentary, The Aristocrats (2005), with Entertainment Weekly saying that \"out of the 101 comedians who appear on screen, no one is funnier - or more disgusting - than Gilbert Gottfried\". \"Gilbert Gottfried Dirty Jokes\" was recently released on both DVD and CD, featuring 50 non-stop minutes of Gottfried telling the funniest and filthiest jokes, ever. The show was filmed live at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City. Also featured on the DVD are some of the funniest bonus features ever, including wild stories, indignant ranting and celebrity impressions that will leave viewers crying for more. For this live performance, Gottfried puts aside political correctness and fires an onslaught of jokes that know no boundaries. At the end of the show, Gottfried tells what is known among comedians as the \"Dirtiest Joke of All Time\", which is also the basis for The Aristocrats (2005). Gottfried is one of the most sought-after comedians, and regularly performs live to sold-out audiences across North America.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc2OTI1NDA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU3MzE3OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331906","name":"Gilbert Gottfried","nicknames":["America's Creepy Uncle"],"idIMDB":"nm0331906"},"actorId":"nm0331906","character":"Iago","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000624","main":true},{"actorName":"Douglas Seale","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780528","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNDMyMTQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM0MzkxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 October 1913","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"The British classical actor/producer/director Douglas Seale enjoyed a 65-year transatlantic career that included stage, films and television. Born in 1913 the son of Robert Henry Seale and his wife Margaret Law Seale, he was educated at Rutlish, a boys' comprehensive school in West Wimbledon. He displayed an early penchant and skill for art but leaned toward the theatre after receiving encouragement by a teacher who saw his performance in a school play. He studied for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and took his first professional curtain bow at London's Embassy Theatre in a production of \"The Drums Begin\" in 1934. He then appeared in repertory until the outbreak of WWII. He served with the British Army in 1940 and was commissioned in the Royal Signals. Following demobilization in 1946, Seale joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theater Company for two seasons at Stratford-on-Avon. He extended his noble talents to include stage producing, which included \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" at the Birmingham Repertory Theater; Shakespeare's \"King John\" at Stratford-on-Avon and Stratford, Ontario; \"Henry V\" in Stratford, Connecticut, and \"King Lear\" at the Old Vic. As a noted director, he helmed such plays as \"King Lear\" for the Marin Shakespeare Festival in San Francisco; \"A Doll's House\" and \"Look Back in Anger\" in Cleveland, and \"The Winslow Boy\" in New York. In later years Seale focused again on performing. He made his Broadway acting debut at age 60 with \"Emperor Henry IV\" in 1973, followed by \"Frankenstein,\" \"The Dresser,\" and \"The Madwoman of Chaillot.\" Among his other roles included Oliver Seaton in \"A Family and a Fortune\" and Reverend Shannon in \"The Night of the Iguana. He is (arguably) best remembered for his 1983 Broadway performance as Selsdon Mowbray, the inebriated thespian who consistently misses his cues in the deft stage-within-a-stage comedy \"Noises Off.\" His hilarious performance earned him a Tony Award nomination for \"featured actor\" in a play. Denholm Elliott played the role in the 1992 film. An occasional on-camera performer blessed with booming, mellifluous tones, Seale was had a featured role in the film Amadeus (1984) and provided the voice of the Sultan in Disney's animated feature Aladdin (1992). In addition, he offered \"old man\" appearances in such popular film fluff as Ernest Saves Christmas (1988) (as Santa Claus), Ghostbusters II (1989), Almost an Angel (1990), Mr. Destiny (1990), For Love or Money (1993), and, his last, Palookaville (1995). Over the years he occasionally played spry gents on such TV shows as \"Cheers\" and \"The Golden Girls.\" One of his final stage roles was as aging vaudevillian Billy Rice in the 1996 revival of John Osborne's play \"The Entertainer.\" Seale was divorced from Elaine Wodson and Joan Geary, his third wife was stage actress and three-time Tony Award nominee Louise Troy, who died of breast cancer in 1994. A Manhattanite at the time of his death, he died at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City at age 85 and was survived by two sons, Jonathan and Timothy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNDMyMTQ1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM0MzkxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780528","name":"Douglas Seale","idIMDB":"nm0780528"},"actorId":"nm0780528","character":"Sultan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000701","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlie Adler","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0012121","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0OTExMTE4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI3NjM3Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 October 1956","placeOfBirth":" Paterson, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Charles Michael Adler","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Charles is an Emmy Award winning Dialogue Director, Annie Award Acting Nominee, Dramalogue Winning Actor, Helen Hayes Award Acting Nominee and Casting Director.
