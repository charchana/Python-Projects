Like Jannings, Schell won the Oscar, but unlike him, he was a dedicated anti-Nazi. Indeed, with the exception of Maurice Chevalier and Marcello Mastroianni, Schell was undoubtedly the most successful non-anglophone foreign actor in the history of American cinema. Schell was born in Vienna, Austria on December 8, 1930, but raised in in Zurich, Switzerland. (Austria became part of Germany after the anschluss of 1938), then was occupied by the allies from 1945 until 1955, when it again joined the family of nations.) He learned his craft on the stage beginning in 1952, and made his reputation with appearances in German-language films and television. He is a fine Shakespearian actor, and had a huge success with \"Richard III\" (he has also appeared in as the eponymous prince in a German-language version of \"Hamlet\"). Schell made his Hollywood debut in 1958 in the World War II film The Young Lions (1958) quite by accident, as the producers had wanted to hire his sister Maria Schell, but lines of communication got crossed, and he was the one hired. He impressed American producers as his turn as the friend of German soldier Marlon Brando, and subsequently assayed the role of the German defense attorney in the television drama Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) on \"Playhouse 90\" in 1959. He was also cast in the big screen remake, for which he won the 1961 Academy Award for Best Actor, beating out co-star Spencer Tracy for the Oscar. He also won a Golden Globe and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for the role. Schell ultimately won two more Oscar nominations for acting, in 1976 for Best Actor for The Man in the Glass Booth (1975) and in 1978 as Best Supporting Actor for Julia (1977) (which also brought him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor). He has twice been nominated for an Emmy for his TV work, and won the 1993 Golden Globe for best performance by an actor in a supporting role in a series, mini-series or made-for-TV movie for Stalin (1992). Schell has also has directed films, and his 1974 film The Pedestrian (1973) (\"The Pedestrian\"), which Schell wrote, produced, directed, and starred in, was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and won the Golden Globe in the same category. His documentary about Marlene Dietrich, Marlene (1984), was widely hailed as a masterpiece of the non-fiction genre and garnered its producers a Best Documentary Oscar nomination in 1985. In 2002, Schell released Meine Schwester Maria (2002) (My Sister Maria), a documentary about the career of and his relationship with Maria Schell. Since the 1990s, Schell has appeared in many German language made-for-TV films, such as the 2003 film Alles Glück dieser Erde (2003) (All the Luck in the World) and in the mini-series The Return of the Dancing Master (2004), which was based on Henning Mankell's novel. He has also continued to appear on stage, appearing in dual roles in the 2000 Broadway production of the stage version of \"Judgment at Nuremberg\", and most recently in Robert Altman's London production of Arthur Miller's play \"Resurrection Blues\" in 2006. He died on 31st of January 2014, aged 83, in Innsbruck, Austria.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MzYyNjkyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzY2MjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001703","name":"Maximilian Schell","idIMDB":"nm0001703"},"actorId":"nm0001703","character":"Jürgen Sengebusch","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mathias Wieman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0927436","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 June 1902","placeOfBirth":" Osnabrück, Germany","bio":"Mathias was born on June 23, 1902. During his long career Mathias starred in more than 50 films and was a veteran of countless stage roles specializing in portrayals of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Dr. Faust. Of his films, one of the more famous he starred in was the Leni Riefenstahl directed The Blue Light (1932), made in 1932. Frau Riefenstahl acted in this film as well as directed it. In \"Das Blaue Licht\", Mathias plays the lead opposite Frau Riefenstahl as a painter who befriends her with unhappy consequences. Frau Riefenstahl and Mathias had worked together previously in another film Storm Over Mont Blanc (1930) in 1930. Frau Riefenstahl, who is 99 years young and whose 100th birthday is coming up in August, 2002, remembers Mathias very well as \"ein wunderbarer Mensch\". Another famous film is the 1936 feature _Ewige Maske, Die (1936)_ a film about a doctor dealing with and overcoming his mental illness. This movie won the 1937 American National Board of Review award for best foreign film and Mathias won the award for best actor. The film was also nominated for an award at the Venice Film Festival. During the time of the National Socialist regime Mathias was \"persona non grata\" with Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda who was responsible for film production in Germany. Other notable films were the 1952 entry at the Cannes Film Festival _Herz der Welt (1951)_ in which Mathias portrayed Dr. Alfred Nobel, and 1954's Fear (1954) co-starring Ingrid Bergman and directed by her husband Roberto Rossellini. In this movie, Mathias plays Ingrid Bergman's husband and it's about an affair Bergman's character has while married to Mathias' character. As a stage actor, Mathias was in many, many different productions including German versions of plays by Shakespeare, G.B. Shaw, and Henrik Ibsen, as well as plays by Germans like Bertholt Brecht. In fact, Mathias was a mainstay of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin for a number of years in the 1920s. It was while working as an actor in Berlin that Mathias met his wife Erika (Friedericke Anna Hedwig Meingast), who was a stage actress. They married on January 11, 1926. Erika gave up her promising acting career after marrying Mathias in order that she could help him in his career. Mathias also worked in radio and recorded narratives of famous works accompanied by symphonic music. Examples of CDs that are currently available are Deutsche Grammophon's 2000 release of \"Mathias Wieman spricht Homer. Aus Der Odyssee\" and Deutsche Grammophon's 2002 release of \"Herman Hesse. Tractat vom Steppenwolf,\" and \"Mozart auf der Reise nach Prag\" (Deutsche Grammophon, 1968). After World War 2, Mathias and Erika moved to Zurich, Switzerland, and it was there that Mathias died from cancer in 1969, followed by Erika, also cancer-related, in 1972. They had no children.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0927436","name":"Mathias Wieman","idIMDB":"nm0927436"},"actorId":"nm0927436","character":"Obersdtudiendirektor Dr. Berger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Albert Lieven","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0509776","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzAwMzgwM2YtOGE1MS00ZTE4LTg5N2EtMmUwYThlYTRjZjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 June 1906","placeOfBirth":" Hohenstein, Germany","birthName":"Albert Fritz Liévin-Liévin","bio":"Albert Lieven was born on June 23, 1906 in Hohenstein, Germany as Albert Fritz Liévin-Liévin.
