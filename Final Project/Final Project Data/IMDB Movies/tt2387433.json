One day after performing in a school play, she decided that she wanted to pursue acting as a career a little further. So at age 13, she enrolled in classes and workshops some of which were at the The Actors School in the in Franklin, Tennessee. It was through these workshops that she met her future manager and agent. They encouraged her to go out to Los Angeles to learn more about the business and \"test the waters\".

Shortly thereafter, she was cast as the female Tribute from District 9 in \"The Hunger Games\" alongside Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutchinson, and Liam Hemsworth. That became the springboard to launch her role in the supernatural thriller, \"Dark Skies\" in 2013. Thurman starred alongside Keri Russell, Josh Hamilton, and Dakota Goyo, as Goyo's friend and confidant, Shelly Jessop. That same year in December, Annie made her television debut as lead, Sally Ryebeck, in Hallmark's presentation \"The Santa Switch\".

She landed a lead role as Sophie in the TNT pilot, \"Proof\", starring Jennifer Beals as Dr. Kathryn Russo, Matthew Modine as eccentric billionaire, Ivan Touring, and executive produced by Kyra Sedgwick. The pilot was soon ordered to series and is due out in 2015. In her off time, Annie enjoys spending time with her family and friends. She loves to play the ukulele, cello and have Tennessee summer fun with friends while driving her Jeep. Annie rides horses and is also an animal lover and advocate. She has two dogs, three cats and one overweight bunny waiting for her every time she gets home to Nashville. Annie is a down-to-earth, small town girl living out her dreams in the big city.

Alyvia is best known for her portrayal of the living legend, Dolly Parton, in the NBC Universal telefilm, \"Coat of Many Colors.\" Aly was recognized by the prestigious Critics' Choice Awards by being nominated for best actress alongside Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, and Kirsten Dunst, and she was also nominated and won the Movieguide's Grace Award for Best Actress. Not only did the MOW break records with 18.6 million viewers, which made COMC the highest-rated movie or miniseries on the broadcast networks in six years, the film walked away with numerous awards, including The Tex Ritter Award and the coveted Epiphany Prize given by the Movieguide Awards. One of Alyvia's favorite parts of working on the film was singing her solos, and recording \"Angel Hill\" an original duet with Dolly Parton. Alyvia is also known for the much publicized, campy Lifetime movie, \"A Deadly Adoption\" where she had the time of her life playing Will Ferrell's and Kristen Wiig's kidnapped daughter. The young actress can be seen in the Warner Bros. film \"Blended\" alongside Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore and Bella Thorne.
