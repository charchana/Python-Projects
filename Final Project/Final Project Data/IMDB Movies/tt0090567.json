Breaking that rule did him no harm, though, as he achieved pop cult status by finding, fighting and blowing up a 25-foot-long Great White shark (nicknamed \"Bruce\") in the mega-hit Jaws (1975) and then electrocuting an even bigger Great White in the vastly inferior Jaws 2 (1978). Athletic Scheider was born in November 1932 in Orange, New Jersey, to Anna (Crosson) and Roy Bernhard Scheider, a mechanic. He was of German and Irish descent. A keen sportsman from a young age, he competed in baseball and boxing (his awkwardly mended broken nose is a result of his foray into Golden Gloves competitions). While at college, his pursuits turned from sports to theater and he studied drama at Rutgers and Franklin and Marshall. After a stint in the military, Scheider appeared with the New York Shakespeare Festival and won an \"Obie Award\" for his appearance in the play \"Stephen D.\" His film career commenced with the campy Z-grade horror cheesefest The Curse of the Living Corpse (1964), and he then showed up in Star! (1968), Paper Lion (1968), Stiletto (1969) and Puzzle of a Downfall Child (1970). In 1971 he really came to the attention of film audiences with his role in the Jane Fonda thriller Klute (1971) and then as Det. Buddy Russo (scoring his first Oscar nomination) alongside fiery Gene Hackman in the crime drama The French Connection (1971). His performance as a tough street cop in that film led him into another tough cop role as NYC Det. Buddy Manucci in the underappreciated The Seven-Ups (1973), which features one of the best car chase sequences ever put on film. In the early 1970s the Peter Benchley novel \"Jaws\" was a phenomenal best-seller, and young director Steven Spielberg was chosen by Universal Pictures to direct the film adaptation, Jaws (1975), in which Scheider played police chief Brody and shared lead billing with Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss in the tale of a New England seaside community terrorized by a hungry Great White shark. \"Jaws\" was a blockbuster, and for many years held the record as the highest-grossing film of all time. Scheider then turned up as the shady CIA agent brother of Dustin Hoffman in the unnerving Marathon Man (1976) and in the misfired William Friedkin-directed remake of The Wages of Fear (1953) titled Sorcerer (1977), before again returning to Amity to battle another giant shark in Jaws 2 (1978). Seeking a change from tough cops and hungry sharks, he took the role of womanizing, drug-popping choreographer Joe Gideon, the lead character of the semi-autobiographical portrayal of director Bob Fosse in the sparkling All That Jazz (1979). It was another big hit for Scheider (and another Oscar nomination), with the film featuring a stunning opening sequence to the tune of the funky George Benson number \"On Broadway\", and breathtaking dance routines including the \"Airotica\" performance by the glamorous Sandahl Bergman. Returning to another law enforcement role, Scheider played a rebellious helicopter pilot in the John Badham conspiracy / action film Blue Thunder (1983), a scientist in the sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) simply titled 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), a cheating husband who turns the tables on his blackmailers in 52 Pick-Up (1986), a cold-blooded hit man in Cohen and Tate (1988) and a CIA operative in the muddled and slow-moving The Russia House (1990). The versatile Scheider was then cast as the captain of a futuristic submarine in the relatively popular TV series SeaQuest 2032 (1993), which ran for three seasons. Inexplicably, however, Scheider had seemingly, and slowly, dropped out of favor with mainstream film audiences, and while he continued to remain busy, predominantly in supporting roles (generally as US presidents or military officers), most of the vehicles he appeared in were B-grade political thrillers such as État d'urgence (1997), Executive Target (1997), Chain of Command (2000) and Red Serpent (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODY5ODg4OTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDUzOTM3Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001702","name":"Roy Scheider","idIMDB":"nm0001702"},"actorId":"nm0001702","character":"Harry Mitchell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0140119","main":true},{"actorName":"Ann-Margret","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000268","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMzM1NjMyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODg1OTQ2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 April 1941","placeOfBirth":" Valsjöbyn, Jämtlands län, Sweden","birthName":"Ann-Margret Olsson","height":"5' 3½\" (1.61 m)","bio":"Actress and singer Ann-Margret is one of the most famous sex symbols and actresses of the 1960s and beyond. She continued her career through the following decades and into the 21st century. Ann-Margret was born Ann-Margret Olsson in Valsjöbyn, Jämtland County, Sweden, to Anna Regina (Aronsson) and Carl Gustav Olsson, who worked for an electrical company. She came to America at age 6. She studied at Northwestern University and left for Las Vegas to pursue a career as a singer. Ann-Margret was discovered by George Burns and soon afterward got both a record deal at RCA and a film contract at 20th Century Fox. In 1961, her single \"I Just Don't Understand\" charted in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 Charts. Her acting debut followed the same year as Bette Davis' daughter in Frank Capra's Pocketful of Miracles (1961). She appeared in the musical State Fair (1962) a year later before her breakthrough in 1963. With Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Viva Las Vegas (1964) opposite Elvis Presley, she became a Top 10 Box Office star, teen idol and even Golden Globe nominated actress. She was marketed as Hollywood's hottest young star and in the years to come got awarded the infamous nickname \"sex kitten.\" Her following pictures were sometimes ripped apart by critics (Bus Riley's Back in Town (1965) and The Swinger (1966)), sometimes praised (The Cincinnati Kid (1965)). She couldn't escape being typecast because of her great looks. By the late 1960s, her career stalled, and she turned to Italy for new projects. She returned and, by 1970, she was back in the public image with Hollywood films (R.P.M. (1970) opposite Anthony Quinn), Las Vegas sing-and-dance shows and her own television specials. She finally overcame her image with her Oscar-nominated turn in Mike Nichols' Carnal Knowledge (1971) and succeeded in changing her image from sex kitten to respected actress. A near-fatal accident at a Lake Tahoe show in 1972 only momentarily stopped her career. She was again Oscar-nominated in 1975 for Tommy (1975), the rock opera film of the British rock band The Who. Her career continued with successful films throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s. She starred next to Anthony Hopkins in Magic (1978) and appeared in pictures co-starring Walter Matthau, Gene Hackman, Glenda Jackson and Roy Scheider. She even appeared in a television remake of Tennessee Williams's masterpiece play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 1983. Another late career highlight for her was Grumpy Old Men (1993) as the object of desire for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. She continues to act in movies today.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMzM1NjMyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODg1OTQ2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000268","name":"Ann-Margret","nicknames":["Slugger"],"idIMDB":"nm0000268"},"actorId":"nm0000268","character":"Barbara Mitchell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0140120","main":true},{"actorName":"Vanity","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889152","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA1OTU2ODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUwMDkwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 January 1959","placeOfBirth":" Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Denise Katrina Matthews","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Vanity was a glamorous Canadian model and lead singer of the all-girl group \"Vanity 6\". She specialized in playing sultry female characters often in trouble with the law. Vanity was born Denise Katrina Matthews in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, the daughter of Helga Senyk and James Levia Matthews. She was of African-American and German descent. Vanity first appeared on screen in the biographical tale of writer Jack London titled Klondike Fever (1980), before venturing into more gritty territory such as the slasher film Le monstre du train (1980), the very odd chick flick Tanya's Island (1980), a B-grade martial arts film entitled The Last Dragon (1985) and the totally weird Never Too Young to Die (1986). However, her best two performances were as the naive stripper assisting blackmail victim Roy Scheider in the under-rated thriller 52 Pick-Up (1986) and as a seductive, smart-talking nightclub singer teaming up with cop Carl Weathers to defeat murderous car tycoon Craig T. Nelson in the violent Action Jackson (1988). Unfortunately, the remainder of Vanity's film work was of the \"straight-to-video\" variety and she only scored minor roles in several low-budget thrillers such as Neon City (1991) and Da Vinci's War (1993). In late 1995, Vanity turned her back on Hollywood and the entertainment industry, and dedicated her life to the Christian faith. Vanity, who suffered from sclerosis encapsulating peritonitis, died on February 15, 2016 in Fremont, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA1OTU2ODc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUwMDkwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889152","name":"Vanity","idIMDB":"nm0889152"},"actorId":"nm0889152","character":"Doreen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0140121","main":true},{"actorName":"John Glover","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001278","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ5NTUzOTQ4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjUxNjIz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 August 1944","placeOfBirth":" Salisbury, Maryland, USA","birthName":"John Soursby Glover Junior","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"John Soursby Glover, Jr., is an American actor, known for a range of villainous roles in films and television, including Lionel Luthor on the Superman-inspired television series Smallville.

While he appeared in over 30 films and well over 300 TV programs over a five-decade career, the theater remained his first and foremost passion and for which he is best remembered. From 1973 until his death 34 years later, he was artistic director of the Group Repertory Theatre (GRT), a North Hollywood non-profit acting organization for which he also served as producer, writer, director and actor. It was a place to which scores and scores of L.A.-based actors would, and did, call \"home\". The facility, which is still running today, was renamed the Lonny Chapman Group Repertory Theatre (LCGRT) in 1999 in loving tribute. He was born Lon Leonard Chapman on October 1, 1920, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but grew up in the city of Joplin, Missouri. His interest in acting started while fairly young. Following his graduations from Joplin High School (1938) and Joplin Junior College (1940), the athletically-inclined Lonny attended the University of Oklahoma on a track scholarship. The bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, interrupted his college studies, joining the Marines the very next day. He saw major action in the South Pacific, including Guadalcanal. During his 5-year tour of duty, he contracted malaria; frequent recurrences would plague him the rest of his life. The track star returned to his Oklahoma college following war duty and graduated with a BFA in Drama in 1947. While at college Lonny became best friends with actor Dennis Weaver, who was also a talented track-and-field athlete and fellow drama student. The two young hopefuls hitchhiked together to New York City where they began their respective careers. Within a year (1948) Lonny was appearing as \"Wiley\" in the Chicago company of \"Mister Roberts\", directed by Joshua Logan. The year after that, he made his Broadway debut in \"The Closing Door\", directed by Lee Strasberg. During this time, he also established strong ties with the prestigious Group Theatre and Actors Studio. It was at the Actors Studio that he forged lifelong friendships with director Mark Rydell, and character actors Martin Landau, R.G. Armstrong, Pat Hingle and Logan Ramsey, among others. Arguably, the peak of Lonny's early stage career occurred in 1950, when he co-starred in the award-winning drama \"Come Back, Little Sheba\", William Inge's first play to be produced on Broadway. Art imitated life in this case as Lonny portrayed the second lead role of \"Turk\", a college student and star athlete. Coincidentally, friend Dennis Weaver became his understudy and eventually took over the role. Starring Tony winners Shirley Booth and Sidney Blackmer, only Ms. Booth went on to recreate her role in the film version for which she won the Oscar. Lonny, who had yet to make a movie, was replaced by the already-established Richard Jaeckel as \"Turk\" in the film version. Lonny continued to solidify his reputation on Broadway with \"The Chase\" (1952), produced and directed by José Ferrer and starring Actors Studio exponents Kim Stanley and Kim Hunter; \"Whistler's Grandmother\" (1952), co-starring Josephine Hull; \"The Ladies of the Corridor\" (1953), directed by renowned \"Group Theatre\" member Harold Clurman; and the Horton Foote-penned \"The Traveling Lady\" (1954), again starring Ms. Stanley. Elsewhere, he earned excellent notices as \"Tom\" opposite Franchot Tone's \"Joe\" in a revival of William Saroyan's \"The Time of Your Life\" and as the \"Gentleman Caller\" in the first national tour of \"The Glass Menagerie\" starring Helen Hayes. By this time, Lonny had begun appearing on early TV, making his debut in an episode of Captain Video and His Cartoon Rangers (1956). His first film was a featured role in the tuneful Doris Day/Frank Sinatra drama Young at Heart (1954) in which he shared secondary scenes with Elisabeth Fraser. Actor Studio preeminent Elia Kazan took a strong liking to Lonny as an actor and looked for no one else to play the role of \"Roy\", the auto mechanic, in the classic John Steinbeck film East of Eden (1955), which catapulted James Dean to cult status. Kazan then gave Lonny a plum role in his film Baby Doll (1956). In the late 1950s, Chapman began to show promise as a mover and shaker in the theater. In 1959, and for eight seasons following, he and co-founder Curt Conway devoted their summer seasons to the Cecilwood Theatre in Fishkill, New York, where he directed over 80 productions and performed in nearly thirty. Those up-and-comers who received their Equity union card under his guidance included Barbra Streisand, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall. As a playwright, Lonny saw two of his own works produced off-Broadway -- \"The Buffalo Skinner\" and \"Cry of the Raindrop\". Lonny migrated to Los Angeles in the 1960s in order to pursue film and TV roles and, along with Martin Landau, helped form the West branch of the Actors Studio out there. His gritty look, trademark dusky voice, earnest demeanor and solid Midwest upbringing was his meal ticket for getting Hollywood work. Tailor-made for earthy, blue-collar roles, he was most at home playing unpretentious folk. One would be hard-pressed to see him donning tie and tails in highly elegant settings when he obviously appeared more at home in a plaid shirt with rolled up sleeves or, at the most, a tweed sport coat with loose tie. He provided stark authenticity to a number of westerns, crimers and small-town dramas. In Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds (1963), he portrayed the concerned diner operator who tends to Tippi Hedren's head wound after her first gull attack. He subsequently played a secondary but pivotal role in director/friend Mark Rydell's picture The Reivers (1969) set in Mississippi with Steve McQueen, and also one of Sally Field's chauvinistic bosses in the down-home drama Norma Rae (1979). He showed remarkable versatility with a top, change-of-pace supporting part in the early Woody Allen comedy classic Take the Money and Run (1969). In 1973, he formed the Group Repertory Theatre and served as its first and only artistic director (until his death). Under his strong leadership, the non-profit organization staged over 350 productions, 45 of which were world premieres of original works. Sean Penn and Jennifer Tilly are former members of the company. Quite visible on TV, he appeared to good advantage in prime-time programming. Headlining one TV series that never got firmly off the ground, The Investigator (1958), in which he played a private detective, he also co-starred with William Shatner and Jessica Walter in the \"Law and Order\" precursor For the People (1965). During the 60s, 70s and 80s, the gruff, bushy-browed actor could always be spotted somewhere on a topnotch crime show (Perry Mason (1957), The Defenders (1961) (recurring role), Judd for the Defense (1967), Mission: Impossible (1966), Mannix (1967), Ironside (1967), Quincy M.E. (1976), Matlock (1986)). He was given just as much footage sitting tall in the saddle in various western series (Laredo (1965), The Rifleman (1958), The Virginian (1962), Bonanza (1959)). He also appeared more than a few times on Gunsmoke (1955) and McCloud (1970), which starred his good friend Dennis Weaver. One particular highlight was his patriarchal role in an above-par TV-movie adaptation of The Rainmaker (1982) co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and Tuesday Weld. A modest, down-to-earth kind of guy with a generous heart and spirit who preferred not to call attention to himself, Chapman was a sturdy film and TV presence over the years playing a hefty number of heroes, villains, boss types and confidantes. Although he worked consistently throughout the years, he never found the one role that might have moved him up the pecking order and propel him to the very top of the character echelon. In the twilight of his film career, he showed eerie countenance in his elderly watchman role in Nightwatch (1997), and last graced the screen as an octogenarian in Reindeer Games (2000), directed by John Frankenheimer and The Hunted (2003), directed by William Friedkin. The last few years of his life were marred by failing health and the increasingly frail actor had to eventually be placed in a Sherman Oaks (California) care facility. He died there of complications from pneumonia and heart disease a little more than a week after his 87th birthday, on October 12, 2007. He was survived by his steadfast wife (of nearly 65 years), the former Erma Dean Gibbons, and their son Wyley Dean.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRjYmZjZmMtYWZjMS00N2UwLWI2YTYtNjRmOTE3ZWE5NzYwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152452","name":"Lonny Chapman","idIMDB":"nm0152452"},"actorId":"nm0152452","character":"Jim O'Boyle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kelly Preston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000593","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2Njk3MTUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY3ODM0MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 October 1962","placeOfBirth":" Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","birthName":"Kelly Kamalelehua Palzis","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Kelly Preston was born on October 13, 1962 in Honolulu, Hawaii.

He continued impressively with roles in \"Walk in Darkness\" (1963), \"Sarah and the Sax\" (1964) and \"Doubletalk\" (1964), and capped his early career with a Theatre World Award and Tony-nomination for the three-person play \"Slow Dance on the Killing Ground\" (1964). Continuing on with powerful work in \"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" (1966) and \"King John,\" Vietnam-era Hollywood finally began to take notice of his \"angry young man\" charisma. His casting as former delinquent-turned-undercover cop Linc Hayes on the highly popular TV cop series Mod Squad (1968) along with fellow white partners Michael Cole and Peggy Lipton was a huge break for all three relative unknowns. Sporting a huge Afro, paisley shirts, dark shades and spouting hip language like \"dig it\" and \"solid\", the trio showed the requisite anti-establishment defiance and coolness to attract the angry, young generation--while still playing the good guys. Following the series' demise in 1973, he purposely avoided the \"blaxploitation\" Hollywood scene and returned to the stage, notably on Broadway opposite Maggie Smith in Tom Stoppard's play \"Night and Day\" (1979). In the 80s he launched an enviable character career in films, often playing a cool, streetwise character or threatening menace. Among his better-known on-screen assignments is the role of Prince's abusive father in Purple Rain (1984), a burnt-out political activist in the spoof I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (1988), the recurring part of Roger Hardy in the twisted cult TV series Twin Peaks (1990), a good-guy cop in Deep Cover (1992), an rioter in the Attica-themed mini-series Against the Wall (1994) and Wesley Snipes heroin-addicted dad in Sugar Hill (1993), among others. Powerful roles on such shows as \"Law & Order,\" \"Profiler\" and \"Judging Amy\" has kept him newsworthy but not strongly in the limelight. Once married to actress Gloria Foster, they appeared together in the movie The Cool World (1963). Following their divorce, they remained friendly and upon her death in 2001, it was he who made the formal announcement.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MzY0MTM5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDg0ODQ2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929934","name":"Clarence Williams III","idIMDB":"nm0929934"},"actorId":"nm0929934","character":"Bobby Shy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0140124","main":true},{"actorName":"Alex Henteloff","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378261","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 May 1942","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Alexander B.

Tom grew up in Houston, in a large family of four sisters, one of whom was openly gay. The shy, soft-spoken and extremely intelligent Byron fast-tracked through high school and graduated one year early. When he turned 18 he moved to Los Angeles, and got a job in an adult video/novelty store, which was located across the street from Jim South's World Modeling Agency. South is a well-known booking agent for adult video actors and actresses. One day in May of 1982 Tom decided to walk in and meet Jim. South was cautious at first, because Tom looked younger than what his driver's license claimed, but wound up signing him to a shoot. Bobby Hollander's \"Anything Goes: Gourmet Video 19\" (1982) was Tom's first shoot. His first scene was with Craig Roberts and Lili Marlene, and Tom unfortunately didn't fare too well under the pressure. However, he decided to stick it out and soon landed major roles in Private Teacher (1985), All American Girls II: In Heat (1983) and the Marilyn Chambers vehicle Up 'n' Coming (1983). With his extraordinary work in those three films, Byron was thrust into the spotlight. Many adult video producers took notice of the talented 21-year-old. Byron, who had been doing a number of loops and magazine still shoots to pay his rent, and work started pouring in. Tom made a name for himself as the consummate professional opposite such adult superstars as Ginger Lynn and Traci Lords, with whom he once shared an apartment. Along with his two friends, Peter North and Marc Wallice, Byron took the adult video world by storm. Between 1982 and 1990 he worked in nearly 1,000 films with virtually every actress in the business. Some of his finest work included the \"Brat\" series, where he played the bumbling husband Morty Dickinson, as well as his work in Sizzle (1982) and New Wave Hookers (1985). Tom has received countless awards for his scene with Ginger Lynn and Steve Powers in \"New Wave Hookers\", a scene which Byron has referred to as \"easy\" but is regarded in adult circles as \"legendary\". By 1991 he had established himself as a presence in the adult-video world. Unfortunately, that was also the same year that the IRS came looking for him regarding unfiled income taxes. He found himself in serious financial debt and was even looking at some jail time if he couldn't straighten out his problems. In order to pay off his debts, Byron took on a rigorous work schedule. In 1991 he appeared in over 250 videos (averaging between two and three scenes per movie) in addition to appearing in a number of still magazine shoots for European and American publications. However, by 1992 he was burned out and unhappy with the industry, and began looking for other diversions. He chose music. He formed a band and began touring the L.A. music scene while doing porn on the side. He got some publicity by demanding a condoms-only policy during his scenes, the first actor to do so, but the publicity was short-lived, as was his music career. In 1993 he dedicated himself full time to appearing in adult films, and gave up his condoms-only stance. Between 1993 and 1996 he worked in well over 500 adult videos, often for his old friend, director Alex de Renzy (aka Rex Borsky). In 1997 Byron signed with a fledgling company called Elegant Angel. Company head Patrick Collins (aka Roscoe Bowltree) decided to bring Byron on board as an actor and a director (Byron had directed one of the Brat movies when director Paul Thomas had taken ill). However, Patrick saw the potential in Byron and pushed him to direct his own video series. After shooting a scene with Sean Michaels and Nikki Brantz that appeared in Sodomania 17: S.M.U.T. (1996), Byron was on his way, and was assigned to direct a series called \"Cumback Pussy\". His directing style was very similar to that of his old buddy DeRenzy, and Byron, as well as Elegant Angel, cleaned up at the the Adult Video News Awards. In 1998 Byron, Robert Black and Van Damage decided to leave the stable of Elegant Angel after they felt betrayed by Collins. They formed their own company called Extreme Associates, named for its promise to produce \"extreme\" videos. Tiffany Mynx also left Elegant Angel and became the company's first contract starlet. Byron attempted to convince his good friend Marc Wallice to leave Elegant Angel also. As well as being a longtime friend, Wallice had been one of the people who helped Byron through his transition from performer to director and had also worked as the editor and cinematographer on many of Byron's early Elegant Angel movies. However, by late 1997 it was revealed that Wallice had contracted the HIV virus, and he subsequently retired. In 1999 Byron began shooting the \"Lord of Asses\", \"Whack Attack\" and \"Planet of the Gapes\" series, which were very similar to his \"Cumback Pussy\" line. He is still going strong and has ventured out, with his friend Rob Black, into the wrestling world. He helped form the Los Angeles-based XPW (Xtreme Pro Wrestling) organization, which is considered the top wrestling outfit behind WWF, WCW and ECW. In 2000 Byron worked almost exclusively for Extreme, with an occasional appearance in a Seymore Butts video. To date Byron has appeared in nearly 2,000 adult videos, a few mainstream films (such as 52 Pick-Up (1986)) and has been inducted into the XRCO and AVN Hall of Fame.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTY1NjUzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjAyNjIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001000","name":"Tom Byron","nicknames":["Tommy"],"idIMDB":"nm0001000"},"actorId":"nm0001000","character":"Party Goer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Herschel Savage","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0184722","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 November 1952","placeOfBirth":" New York, USA","birthName":"Harvey Joel Cowen","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Herschel Savage, the star of such tongue-in-cheek productions as Orifice Party (1985), is one of the old lions of the porno film business, having appeared in close to a thousand features, videos and assorted shoots.

However, don't confuse Ron with the similar looking mustachioed 1970/'80s adult film star, Harry Reems, who has long since retired from the adult film industry. Portly Ron is not blessed with film star looks and a chiseled six-pack (a decidedly unchiseled 12- or 18-pack would be more like it) - his appeal and talents lie in other areas (which happen to be in his long 'member' measuring nearly 10 inches, erect!) and his \"regular guy\" appearance and amazing endurance in front of the camera have undoubtedly contributed to his phenomenal success in an industry notorious for dumping those men who can't perform on cue. He's also one of the very few adult film stars to make the jump into mainstream cinema, with minor appearances in movies such as Reindeer Games (2000), Detroit Rock City (1999) and The Boondock Saints (1999). He was born Ron Jeremy Hyatt on March 12, 1953, in New York City and graduated from Cardozo High School (Queens, NY) in 1971, attained a masters degree from Queens College and then commenced special educational teaching in the New York City area. In 1978, a girlfriend sent his photo off to \"Playgirl\" magazine for appearance in its \"Boy Next Door\" pages. It was an understatement to say that Ron was deluged with female fan mail, and letters of interest from adult filmmakers! Beginning in 1979, he has appeared in well over 800 adult feature films including Inside Seka (1981), Debbie Does Dallas Part II (1981), Terms of Endowment (1986) Lust of Blackula (1987), 21 Hump Street (1988) and Natural Born Thrillers (1994). At 50+ years of age, the charismatic and often comedic Ron Jeremy is still appearing in front of the camera in adult films and he's definitely attained iconic status in the adult entertainment industry and beyond.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzExNDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDc4MDM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000465","name":"Ron Jeremy","nicknames":["Hedgehog","The Porn King","R.J."],"idIMDB":"nm0000465"},"actorId":"nm0000465","character":"Party Goer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0090567","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090567","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$1,654,835","country":"USA","day":"09","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":"730 Screens"}],"gross":[{"money":"$5,186,646","country":"USA","day":"21","month":"12","year":"1986","remarks":""},{"money":"$5,130,770","country":"USA","day":"14","month":"12","year":"1986","remarks":""},{"money":"$5,030,447","country":"USA","day":"07","month":"12","year":"1986","remarks":""},{"money":"$4,844,010","country":"USA","day":"30","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":""},{"money":"$4,275,844","country":"USA","day":"23","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":""},{"money":"$3,421,322","country":"USA","day":"16","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":""},{"money":"$1,654,835","country":"USA","day":"09","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":[{"money":"$25,250","country":"USA","day":"21","month":"12","year":"1986","remarks":"48 Screens"},{"money":"$50,691","country":"USA","day":"14","month":"12","year":"1986","remarks":"152 Screens"},{"money":"$120,621","country":"USA","day":"07","month":"12","year":"1986","remarks":"217 Screens"},{"money":"$420,809","country":"USA","day":"30","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":"298 Screens"},{"money":"$504,613","country":"USA","day":"23","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":"426 Screens"},{"money":"$1,162,767","country":"USA","day":"16","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":"728 Screens"},{"money":"$1,654,835","country":"USA","day":"09","month":"11","year":"1986","remarks":"730 Screens"}],"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"16","month":"04","year":"1986","remarks":null},null],"copyrightHolder":"© MCMLXXXVI Cannon Films, Inc. and Cannon International B.V.
