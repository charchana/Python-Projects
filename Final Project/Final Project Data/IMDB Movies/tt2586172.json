As a young man he served in the US Marine Corps Reserve. Starting as a page at the National Broadcasting Company, Keeshan later began his on-air career as the original \"Clarabell, the Clown\" for the NBC The Howdy Doody Show (1947) (aka \"The Howdy Doody Show\"). He was then the first host/performer of WJZ/WABC TV Ch. 7 NYC's \"Time For Fun\" / \"The Johnny Jellybean Show\". Keeshan emceed the show as \"Corny The Clown\" weekdays at noon from Monday, September 21st, 1953, to Friday, July 29th, 1955. He co-created, co-produced and hosted \"Tinker's Workshop\" with Jack Miller on WJZ/WABC TV Ch. 7 in New York City weekday mornings from Monday, November 15, 1954 to Friday, September 9, 1955. The show continued without Robert until Friday August 22, 1958. The later hosts of the show were Henry Burbig, Gene London & Dom DeLuise. When asked to put together a show for children, he leaped at the chance. On Monday, October 3rd, 1955, Captain Kangaroo (1955) began its near 30-year run on CBS, until it was moved to Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the 1980s. There was a lot of fun in the \"Treasure House\", with Bunny Rabbit swindling carrots before lunch from The Captain or Mister Moose finding yet another way to get the Captain to stand still long enough to drop dozens of ping-pong balls down on the ever-unsuspecting Captain's head. Dennis (Cosmo Allegretti) asking so many questions that Mister Bainter would almost always lose his cool. All the while during this, Captain Kangaroo taught us values and gave those with busy or absent fathers a gentle and caring male role model to learn good behavior and manners from. A love of reading was encouraged and the animals that Mister Green Jeans (Hugh Brannum) showed allowed children who had never seen a particular animal to experience it though his fascination with it. During its run in 1964, Keeshan also took on a Saturday morning persona as \"Mister Mayor\" for a year, but remained the Captain until the end of its run on PBS in 1993. Over the years he and the show won six Emmy's and three Peabody Awards, totaling nine awards, altogether, and he was also elected to the Clown Hall of Fame. In 1989 he published \"Growing Up Happy\" and then in October of 1996 he published \"Good Morning Captain: 50 Wonderful Years with Bob Keeshan, TV's Captain Kangaroo\". Keeshan is also the author of the \"Itty Bitty Kitty\" children's book series. Widowed in the 1990s, he died in Vermont in 2004.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODkwNTMxOTQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjIyMDY2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444828","name":"Robert Keeshan","nicknames":["Bob"],"idIMDB":"nm0444828"},"actorId":"nm0444828","character":"Clarabell the Clown","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0073055","main":true},{"actorName":"Bob Smith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0807470","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI3ZjQ2MGMtODFiZC00MDM3LTg5NGMtYmViNTVlMTYxNWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 November 1917","placeOfBirth":" Buffalo, New York, USA","birthName":"Robert Schmidt","bio":"Beloved pioneer TV kids' show host, Buffalo Bob Smith was the co-creator and host of TV's Howdy Doody (1954) for almost its entire thirteen-year run (NBC: 1947 - 1960), being sidelined for a little less than a year by a near-fatal heart attack in 1954. With his open, friendly personality, combined with the antics of the show's puppet and human casts, he won over the hearts of America's baby-boomer children easily, a hold he retains in spirit to this day. After a decade of semi-retirement following the show's cancellation in September 1960, Bob Smith made a huge comeback on the college campus circuit in the early 1970s, including a sold-out engagement at New York City's legendary rock palace, \"The Fillmore East\". Although he continued to make sporadic, successful appearances (TV, films, and in person) until the end of his life, his one attempt to bring \"Howdy Doody\" back as a regular series, in 1976, was regrettably a failure. He and his wife of more than 50 years had three children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmI3ZjQ2MGMtODFiZC00MDM3LTg5NGMtYmViNTVlMTYxNWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0807470","name":"Bob Smith","idIMDB":"nm0807470"},"actorId":"nm0807470","character":"Buffalo Bob Smith / Voice of Howdy Doody","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0365561","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2586172","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2586172","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["8 min"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.9","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"23","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0149686","name":"United World Films"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:17:29"}}
