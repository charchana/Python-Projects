She vows (against all logic) to build a new palace for Caesar within three months. Since all her architects are either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.","simplePlot":"Astérix and Obélix go to Egypt to help architect Numérobis who is building a palace for Cleopatra.","actors":[{"actorName":"Gérard Depardieu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDU4OTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwODY0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 December 1948","placeOfBirth":" Châteauroux, Indre, France","birthName":"Gérard Xavier Marcel Depardieu","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Gérard Depardieu was born in Châteauroux, Indre, France, to Anne Jeanne Josèphe (Marillier) and René Maxime Lionel Depardieu, who was a metal worker and fireman.
