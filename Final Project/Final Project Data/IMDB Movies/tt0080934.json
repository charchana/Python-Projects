He left school at 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the years that followed he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit, \"The Long and the Short and the Tall.\" Zulu (1964), the 1964 epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-'60s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), Play Dirty (1969), Battle of Britain (1969), Too Late the Hero (1970), The Last Valley (1971) and especially Get Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command. There were some gems amongst the dross, however. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Educating Rita (1983) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999) (his second Oscar) and Last Orders (2001) have been widely acclaimed.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","name":"Michael Caine","idIMDB":"nm0000323"},"actorId":"nm0000323","character":"Blair Maynard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Warner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001831","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMzg2Nzg1MjheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDk4Nzg0Mzg@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 July 1941","placeOfBirth":" Manchester, England, UK","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"David Hattersley Warner was born July 29, 1941 in Manchester, England, to Ada Doreen (Hattersley) and Herbert Simon Warner. He has described his childhood as \"messy\". His father changed jobs often and moved from town to town. David attended eight schools and \"failed his exams at all of them\". His parents separated when he was a teenager and he only saw his mother again seven years later - on her deathbed. After a series of odd jobs, he was accepted at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) where he was very unhappy. After RADA, he became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and got the role of Blifil in the adventure comedy Tom Jones (1963). With the title role in the comedy-drama Morgan! (1966) and a two-year stint as Hamlet with the RSC, Warner became a star at age 24. He has often played villains in such films as The Thirty-Nine Steps (1978), Time After Time (1979), Time Bandits (1981), TRON (1982) and Titanic (1997). He also appeared in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991), two sequels to the popular Star Trek films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMzg2Nzg1MjheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDk4Nzg0Mzg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001831","name":"David Warner","idIMDB":"nm0001831"},"actorId":"nm0001831","character":"John David Nau","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Angela Punch McGregor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0700574","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 January 1953","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","bio":"Angela Punch McGregor was born on January 21, 1953 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Together they founded the radical theater group The Rehearsal Room in the 50s that specifically dealt with his country's injustices. In fact, over the years his performances in \"The Blood Knot,\" \"Boesman and Lena,\" \"A Lesson from Aloes\" and \"Master Harold...and the Boys,\" have been universally applauded. He fled the racist apartheid policies in South Africa in 1969 and migrated to America, subsequently winning a Tony award in 1982 for \"Master Harold...\" and proceeded to perform in American films to somewhat lesser acclaim, including A Dry White Season (1989) (1989), A Rage in Harlem (1991) (1991) and Waterworld (1995) (1995).
