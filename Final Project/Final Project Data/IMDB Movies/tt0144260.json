Possibly her most acclaimed starring role is as her mentor 'Rainer Werner Fassbinder' in \"A Man Called EVA\" (Fassbinder, who treated Eva Mattes kindly, was sometimes referred to by his initials RWF). The daughter of a film composer father and actress mother, Mattes first gained attention in her teens, when she began her acting career: for Fassbinder (Jail Bait, Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, Effi Briest), as a Vietnamese rape victim (Verhoven's O.K., based on the same tragedy as Casualties of War (1989)), and briefly stumbling into early 70s exploitation fare (Naked Massacre, based on the Richard Speck murders). Mattes moved into leads in prestige and socially conscious films, including Herzog's \"Stroszek\" (as a German prostitute who flees to the U.S.), Fassbinder's \"In A Year of 13 Moons\" (as the daughter of a transsexual), Adlon's Céleste (1980) (the title role, as Proust's devoted aide), and Hauff's Mathias Kneissl (1971) (the German Robin Hood). Her recent roles include the mother of the young go-between in Enemy at the Gates, and opposite Isaach De Bankole (the assassin in Casino Royale (2006)) in Otomo. Recently she turned to singing (a CD of English-language standards, 2006) and doing children's films, as well as stage dramas and musicals. As of 2008, she's starring in the world's longest-running detective series, Tatort. In addition to her artist daughter Hanna (with director Werner Herzog), Mattes also has a son Josef, a busy young actor.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0559837","name":"Eva Mattes","idIMDB":"nm0559837"},"actorId":"nm0559837","character":"Bilja","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Merab Ninidze","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0632457","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" Tbilisi, USSR [now Republic of Georgia]","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Merab Ninidze was born on November 3, 1965 in Tbilisi, USSR.

His acting talent was discovered very early and he won a scholarship with respected director Bojan Stupica. After graduating Belgrade Drama Arts Academy and playing a few theater roles, Ljubisa Samardzic was given the part in Igre na skelama (1961). After that experience, he decided to quit theater and try his luck in movies. In a few years he got the leading roles in some of the most popular or influential movies ever made in former Yugoslavia and soon became one of the movie icons in that country, together with 'Velimir 'Bata' Zivojinovic', Milena Dravic and Boris Dvornik. In the 1980s and during the break-up of Yugoslavia his acting star began to fade but he managed to switch careers by founding his own movie production company together with his son Dragan Samardzic. The company not only survived the harsh times of UN sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, but managed to produce few successful movies that became popular in many of the former Yugoslav republics. Ljubisa Samardzic now lives and works in Belgrade, is married and has two children and two grandchildren.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDc0ZjgxYzMtYjBkYy00ODc2LWJkOWItYzc0NTdiYzlmMzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc4MzI2NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0759685","name":"Ljubisa Samardzic","nicknames":["Smoki"],"idIMDB":"nm0759685"},"actorId":"nm0759685","character":"Bora","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tamara Simunovic","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0801425","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1973","placeOfBirth":" Berlin, Germany","height":"5' 5¾\" (1.67 m)","bio":"Tamara Simunovic was born in 1973 in Berlin, Germany.
