While he was playing on the grass he found a WW II bomb that exploded and today the signs of injury are still visible on his face. He practiced many sports in his life, boxing, gymnastics, tennis etc. He also worked in a Cyrcus. In the early years of his youth he discovered a great passion for the cinema, he knew the most important Italian actors and his idle Burt Lancaster and decided to start acting. In the beginning, he worked as stunt-man, and in small roles in big productions: in \"Bem Hur\" by William Wyler he works uncredited. Then the director, Duccio Tessari, gave him the first role as protagonist in the film \"Arrivano i Titani\". Luchino Visconti wants him for the role of a general in \"Il gattopardo\" (but the scenes with Gemma will be mostly cut). This was followed by important roles in \"Angelica\", by the French director Bernard Borderie, where Gemma has a leading role; and the first spaghetti western films, where he worked under the name of Montgomery Wood in the first titles. \"Una pistola per Ringo\", \"Il ritorno di Ringo\" and \"Un dollaro bucato\" are among his greatest successes. Then he played his most important roles in \"Il deserto dei Tartari\" by Valerio Zurlini and \"Il prefetto di ferro\" by Pasquale Squitieri. He won important prizes: Best actor at the Festival of Karlovy Vary, Best actor at the Montréal film festival, and the Grolla d'Oro in San Vincent Festival. In 1986 he became Cavaliere della Repubblica italiana. In the last years Gemma worked mostly for Italian television, and he discovered another great passion, sculpture. In fact he has become rather skilled. He is the father of actress Vera Gemma and Giuliana Gemma.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZmMWY2OGEtNmRmMi00N2ViLTgzZTQtNDJhYTJmM2YxNDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0312575","name":"Giuliano Gemma","idIMDB":"nm0312575"},"actorId":"nm0312575","character":"Vladek","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Senta Berger","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000919","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NTE2NDM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1MzIyOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 May 1941","placeOfBirth":" Vienna, Austria","height":"5' 4¼\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Senta Berger was born in 1941 in Vienna, Austria to her father Josef Berger who was a musician and her mother Therese Berger, a school teacher.

She was born Sybille Johanna Danninger on May 24, 1952, in Wels, Austria, the daughter of a US Army major father and an Austrian mother. She grew up on army bases in such places as New Jersey, Maryland and Sacramento, California. Sybil attended Etontown's Star of the Sea Catholic School. At age 14 she worked for her uncle as a dental assistant. Two years later she moved to Vienna, Austria, and worked for a dental supply company. She then relocated to Salzburg and worked as an assistant to a top oral surgeon. Danning then enrolled in the Buchner School of Cosmetology in Salzburg and received a diploma in facial treatment, decorative make-up, manicure and body massage. She soon began doing fashion shows and photo layouts. Danning made her film debut as Lorelei in Komm nur, mein liebstes Vögelein (1968). She next portrayed Kriemhild in The Long Swift Sword of Siegfried (1971). Sybil studied for three years with noted Munich drama coach Anne-Marie Hanschke. Sybil made memorable appearances in such mainstream features as Barbe-bleue (1972), The Three Musketeers (1973), Crossed Swords (1977) and The Concorde... Airport '79 (1979). She also continued to act in such enjoyably lowbrow exploitation items as Naughty Nymphs (1972), Das Mädchen mit der heißen Masche (1972) and Cat in the Cage (1978). Danning was especially excellent and impressive as the fierce Valkyrie warrior Saint-Exmin in the science-fiction cult classic Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). Other notable roles are tough prison inmate Ericka in the babes-behind-bars classic Chained Heat (1983), a formidable female swordfighter in I sette magnifici gladiatori (1983), wicked werewolf queen Stirba in Howling II: ... Your Sister Is a Werewolf (1985), a cunning femme fatale English professor in They're Playing with Fire (1984), the Queen of the Moon in the hilarious Amazon Women on the Moon (1987), the strict Warden Sutter in the amusing chicks-in-chains parody Reform School Girls (1986), an alien queen in The Phantom Empire (1988) and a rugged lady bounty hunter in L.A. Bounty (1989). Sybil has done guest spots on the television series Vega$ (1978), Simon & Simon (1981), V (1984), Masquerade (1983), The Fall Guy (1981), Deadly Nightmares (1983), Street Hawk (1985) and Superboy (1988). She did a ten-page pictorial for the August 1983 issue of \"Playboy\". Outside of acting, Danning has also worked on several movies as a producer and wrote the story for \"L.A. Bounty\". After a regrettably lengthy absence from acting, Sybil Danning has made a welcome comeback by appearing as an evil Nazi villainess in the \"Werewolf Women of the SS\" mock trailer for Grindhouse (2007) and a nurse in Rob Zombie's remake Halloween (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzMDcxODgxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTExODAyOTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000356","name":"Sybil Danning","nicknames":["The Queen of the B movies"],"idIMDB":"nm0000356"},"actorId":"nm0000356","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Francesca Romana Coluzzi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0173399","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 May 1943","placeOfBirth":" Tirana, Albania","height":"5' 11¾\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Francesca Romana Coluzzi was born on May 20, 1943 in Tirana, Albania.
