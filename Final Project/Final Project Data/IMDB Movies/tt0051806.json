He has given a new dimension to that magical state known as Stardom. And for his exemplary work he was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2001 by the President of India. From the time he embarked on his career as a Film Actor in the mid-forties till now, his movies has been a journey filled with enriching experiences for the 'Evergreen Living Legend' of Indian Cinema. And he has always remained eternally youthful by his remarkable ability to live always in the present and the future; never in the past. Also, as head of his film production company Navketan International Films, which was founded in 1949, Anand has introduced a multitude of talent to the Indian Film Industry by way of actors, directors, music composers and cinematographers. Today, he continues to introduce new talent to cinema and experiment with new ideas for movies. And today, he also heads one of the finest Film Sound Post-Production facilities in India - Anand Recording Studios - which has to its credit more than 3,000 Indian feature films that have been mixed/ surround mixed for worldwide release. Anand has won two Filmfare Awards - India's equivalent of the Oscars - in 1958 for his performance in the film \"Kala Paani\" (Black Water) and in 1966 for his performance in Navketan International Films' \"Guide\". \"Guide\" went on to win Filmfare Awards in five other categories including 'Best Film' and 'Best Director' and was sent as India's entry for the Oscars in the foreign film category that year. He co-produced the English Version of \"Guide\" with the Nobel Laureate Pearl S. Buck (\"The Good Earth\"). Eventually, his creative sensibilities got the better of him and he started writing and directing his own movies. In 1993, he received a Filmfare 'Lifetime Achievement Award' and in 1996 he received a Screen Videocon 'Lifetime Achievement Award'. Then in 1997 he was given the Mumbai Academy of Moving Images Award for his Outstanding Services to the Indian Film Industry. In 1998, he was given a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' by the Ujala Anandlok Film Awards Committee in Calcutta. In 1999, he received the Sansui 'Lifetime Achievement Award' for his 'Immense Contribution to Indian Cinema' in New Delhi. In the year 2000, he was awarded the Film Goers' 'Mega Movie Maestro of the Millenium' Award in Mumbai. And then in July 2000, in New York City, he was honored by an Award at the hands of the then First Lady of the United States of America - Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton - for his 'Outstanding Contribution to Indian Cinema'. And again Anand was awarded the Indo-American Association 'Star of the Millennium' Award in the Silicon Valley, California. The President of India honored Anand with the prestigious Padma Bhushan Award on India's Republic Day - August 15, 2001. And yet again, Donna Ferrar, Member New York State Assembly, honored him with a New York State Assembly Citation for his 'Outstanding Contribution to the Cinematic Arts Worthy of the Esteem and Gratitude of the Great State of New York' on May 1, 2001. Most recently, in April 2003, Anand was given a 'Lifetime Achievement Award' by the F.I.F.A. Committee in Johannesburg, South Africa. For an Indian Movie Icon who has hobnobbed with royalty, heads of State and celebrities, he has done it all. Anand continues to forge ahead with his new All American Film Project \"Song Of Life\" - a musical love story which will be entirely shot in the United States. He will play the central character in this film which will have a predominantly American star cast and for which the Music will be composed by American composers and sung by American singers. \"Song Of Life\" will be made in English and will be directed by Dev Anand.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDI0OTQzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTgwMzEzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007147","name":"Dev Anand","nicknames":["Dev Saab"],"idIMDB":"nm0007147"},"actorId":"nm0007147","character":"Karan Mehra","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Madhubala","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0534870","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MTAzMzc2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkyNDAzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 February 1933","placeOfBirth":" Delhi, British India","birthName":"Begum Mumtaz Jehan Dehlavi","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Arguably the most beautiful artiste to ever grace the Indian screen, Madhubala rose from humble beginnings to become the most captivating star India has ever produced. Madhubala was born Mumtaz Jehan Begum on Valentine's Day 1933, in a poor, conservative family of Pathan Muslims in Delhi, a part of a prolific brood of sisters, and entered the world of films at the tender age of eight. After about five years of playing child roles, Madhubala got her first break in a lead role in Neel Kamal (1947), produced anddirected by her mentor, veteran filmmaker Kidar Sharma. At the age of 14, she played a romantic lead against another fledgling star, Raj Kapoor, and Madhubala had finally arrived on the Indian screen. Over the next two years she had blossomed into a truly rapturous beauty (which earned her the sobriquet of the Venus Of the Indian Screen) and with the movie Mahal (1949), literally overnight, she was a superstar. It has been often said that her beauty overshadowed her acting talents, which to an extent is true; however this was more due to poor judgement than lack of talent. Being encumbered by a large family to support, and forever living under the domination of an imperious father who, she made several poor choices in movies which seriously undermined her credibility as a serious performer, to the extent of being labelled \"box-office poison\". However, her more or less dismal repertoire in the 50s was marked by spots of true brilliance - movies like Tarana (1951), Mr. & Mrs. '55 (1955) and of course her swansong Mughal-E-Azam (1960) showcased her remarkable talents as a serious artiste across several genres and revealed what this ethereal beauty was truly capable of. Sadly, she was plagued by a persistent heart disease that confined her to a bed for almost nine torturous years, and eventually claimed her life on February 23 1969, nine days after her 36th birthday. In this short life, she had made over 70 movies, and to this day remains one of the most enduring legends of Indian cinema.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MTAzMzc2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkyNDAzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0534870","name":"Madhubala","nicknames":["Venus Queen"],"idIMDB":"nm0534870"},"actorId":"nm0534870","character":"Asha","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nalini Jaywant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419787","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MzA2OTk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY1NTAzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 February 1926","placeOfBirth":" Bombay, Bombay Presidency, British India","bio":"Nalini Jaywant was born on February 18, 1926 in Bombay, Bombay Presidency, British India.
