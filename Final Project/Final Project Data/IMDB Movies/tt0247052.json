Rogers talks while the planes are in flight, there's aerial photography, and we see airports and the cities themselves. Rogers pokes at the U.S. Congress for delaying air travel, and he reassures us that air travel is safe, convenient, and fast. Rogers praises Henry Ford's interest in aviation as well as Swiss crop rotation policies, and he celebrates Berlin's busy \"air house\" - home to 38 scheduled air routes. After a hydroplane tour of the Alps, it's on to beautiful Paris. America needs commercial air travel, says Will.","simplePlot":"Humorist Will Rogers (1879-1935) pitches commercial aviation during a three-day tour of Europe: from Croydon to Amsterdam, then to Berlin, and on to Paris via Switzerland.

He transported pack animals across the South Atlantic from Buenos Aires to South Africa for use in the Boer War (1899-1902). He stayed in Johannesburg for a short while, appearing there in Wild West shows where he drew upon his expertise with horse and lasso. Returning to America, he brought his talents to vaudeville and by 1917 was a Ziegfeld Follies star. Over the years he gradually blended into his act his unique style of topical, iconoclastic humor, in which he speared the efforts of the powerful to trample the rights of the common man, while twirling his lariat and perhaps chewing on a blade of straw. Although appearing in many silents, he reached his motion-picture zenith with the arrival of sound. Now mass audiences could hear his rural twang as he delivered his homespun philosophy on behalf of Everyman. The appeal and weight of his words carried such weight with the average citizen that he was even nominated for governor of Oklahoma (which he declined).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMTA1NTQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDMwMTM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0737259","name":"Will Rogers","nicknames":["Bill","Swill Rogers"],"idIMDB":"nm0737259"},"actorId":"nm0737259","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0247052","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247052","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":null,"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["300 m (1 reel)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.5","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"18","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0019372","name":"Pathé Exchange"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["travel","aviation","hydroplane","alps","switzerland","europe","aerial photography","radio","transmitter","wireless radio","commercial plane","narration","on screen narration","narrator","traveler","sightseeing boat","sightseeing","canal","arc de triomphe paris","husband wife relationship","pilot","radio transmitter","white cliffs of dover","paris france","mont blanc","zurich switzerland","commercial aviation history","air strip","hanger","airfield","berlin germany","amsterdam netherlands","belgium","croydon london","airplane"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 18:05:54"}}
