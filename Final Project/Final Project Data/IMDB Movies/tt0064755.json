Born in 1919 in Odense, where he also grew up, his parents were Arthur and Inger Sprogøe. He married his wife Eva in 1945, the same year as his stage debut at Folketeatret in Copenhagen. Through a long career in film, television and theatre, his most famous role was as Egon Olsen in the film series \"Olsenbanden\". The characters and the 14 films are common ground for all Danes and also became popular in Germany as well as in Norway and Sweden where local versions were produced. Even so, Sprogøe was always able to maintain a diverse range as an actor, playing all genres on stage as well as on screen. This included a multitude of popular comedies, a recurring role in the popular series Matador (1978) and a great number of variety shows.

Karl Stegger was born: Carl Johan Stegger Sørensen. He later replaced the \"c\" in his first name with a \"k\" to further his acting-career. He was born in Aarhus on the January 11th 1911. Stegger was educated at Aarhus theatre, where he was hired as an actor for 5 years until 1951. After 1951 he worked at various theatres all around Denmark. But Karl Stegger was mostly famous for his various, and mostly, bi-roles in Danish films and TV. Karl Stegger had his film debut in 1950 with smaller role in [Smedestræde 4]. Stegger subsequently acted in well over 160 films (almost everyone Danish), where he mostly played down-to-earth and sly types. Stegger seldom had a lead part in any film. He became famous in Denmark when he got the part of the father in the Danish film-series: \"Far til Fire\" in 1955, after Ib Schønberg died (who originally had the part). Another famous part he had was as the scrap dealer in \"Olsen-banden i Jylland\" from 1971. In 1971 he got a Danish film-price, a \"Bodil\", for a role as a real-estate salesman in \"Ballade på Christianshavn\". In his later years, Stegger became even more famous for his role as the Swedish-consul in the Danish TV-epic \"Matador\". His last role was in 1980 in \"Trællenes børn\".

Stone usually was seen in a strong, unsympathetic vein -- an unyielding father or husband, corrupt businessman, menacing crime figure, etc. A sober-looking gent with a block jaw, Romanesque-styled nose and steely gray-black hair, he was also prone to playing ethnic types of varying origins. Born Harold Jacob Hochstein in New York City on March 3, 1913, the scion of a Jewish acting family who established themselves in the Yiddish theater, Stone started on stage with his father as a child. He once entertained a career in medicine, attaining a BA degree at the University of Buffalo Medical School, but acting proved too strong a desire. After initially finding work in radio, Stone made his Broadway bow with \"The World We Make\" (1939), which led to other productions such as \"Morning Star\" (1940) and \"A Bell for Adano\" (1944). His early work in New York on stage and TV eventually paved the way to a modest character career in movies and a move to Hollywood. In the 1950s Stone began to provide a minor, shady presence in such \"A\" films as Humphrey Bogart's The Harder They Fall (1956), Alfred Hitchcock's The Wrong Man (1956), the Rocky Graziano biopic Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), the ultimate gladiator spectacle Spartacus (1960) and the gangster epic The St. Valentine's Day Massacre (1967) in which he played Chicago mobster Frank Nitti. He also played a no-nonsense foil to good friend Jerry Lewis in a few of his wacky 60s comedies. None of these, however, did much to improve his standing. Television, on the other hand, became a strong and steady medium for Stone, and he became a fixture in hundreds of police dramas including _\"77 Sunset Strip\" (1958/I)_, Naked City (1958), The Untouchables (1959), Mannix (1967), Mission: Impossible (1966), The Rockford Files (1974) and Kojak (1973). He was once Emmy-nominated for a dramatic guest role. Left a widower by his first wife Joan in 1960, by whom he had two children, he continued to work primarily on episodic TV into the mid-1980s before retiring and settling down with his second wife Miriam (from 1962), who bore him another child. He died in Woodland Hills, California at age 92.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzODYyMTcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzczOTAz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0831905","name":"Harold J.
