Her family consists of her dad, Shubeer, a former Indian Air Force Wing Commander; mom, Subhra, Jewelry Designer and owner of a Dubai-based store. She has two siblings, a sister named Neelam, who is married to Nauman Malik, and a brother named Rajeev. Subhra's dad was a poet. She attended different schools in Jorhat, and Nagpur, but spend the majority of her schooling days in the Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute and Air Force Silver School in Delhi. She was regarded as a tomboy and spent most of her times with boys. Since the schools were Hindi medium, she could not speak English until she was 16 years of age. She subsequently not only mastered English, but became an English Honors student, and also obtained a degree in Journalism. Due to her place of birth she can speak Urdu flawlessly. Her first public appearance was at the Air Force Club Contest at the age of 15. She did a few fashion shows thereafter. Then during 1994 she decided to be a participant in Miss India beauty pageant, fully aware that she was being pitted against the reigning favorite, Aishwarya Rai. Sushmita took everyone by surprise when she was crowned Miss India while Aishwarya had to content with being the First Runner-up. Both beauties went on to win Miss Universe and Miss World titles respectively. Ironically the final outfit for Miss Universe for Sushmita was made by a little-known Meena Bazar tailor, and her mom. It was during 1996 that she first appeared as herself in a Bollywood movie titled 'Dastak'. Though the movie did not fare too well, she was noticed and thus began her career on the silver screen. She has since then portrayed herself in a variety of characters and also some 'item' numbers. Not considered a classic beauty and leading quite an unconventional lifestyle she ended up in many relationships but did not marry anyone. She wanted to be a mother and to adopt a baby girl, and name her Renee. Since she is single, she had to fight a Court battle before she could finally adopt Renee. Finally on 13 April 2000 she was given the go-ahead to adopt her, even though the family-owned business in Dubai was already re-named as 'Renee' quite ironically a year earlier on 13 April 1999.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRhMzE5YzYtZTllOC00ZGRmLTgzNmYtOTkxNjhmYjFmZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784047","name":"Sushmita Sen","nicknames":["Titu","Sush"],"idIMDB":"nm0784047"},"actorId":"nm0784047","character":"Shimmer Canhai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fardeen Khan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007228","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQwMzg2NzU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDIxMjMzOTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 March 1972","placeOfBirth":" Bombay, Maharashtra, India","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"Fardeen Khan was born on March 8, 1972 in Bombay, Maharashtra, India.

His mother tongue is Telugu. Johnny studied in Andhra Telugu School till the seventh grade but couldn't study further because of financial problems in his family, after which he decided to leave school and started working different kinds of odd jobs, such as selling pens on the streets of Bombay by imitating Bollywood stars and dancing to the songs of Bollywood stars. He also spent his early ages in Yakutpura a old city of Hyderabad from where he learnt the unique style of comedy acting. He developed a passion for mimicry and stand-up comedy, inspired by watching comedians like Johnny Walker, Kishore Kumar and Mehmood in films and mimicry artists like Dinesh Hingoo and Nerella Venumadhav on stage, and thus decided to be a mimicry artist. To seek guidance and help regarding mimicry, he met his mentor Pratap Jani and mimicry artist Ram Kumar, who helped him and taught him the basics of mimicry. Lever was also employed in Hindustan Lever's factory in Mumbai with his father. While working, he entertained his co-workers in the factory by imitating Elvis Presley. At one of the functions at his factory he was asked to perform and show his talent. His popularity among coworkers and officers of the factory by his performance earned him the nickname \"Johnny Lever\". He started to perform in musical shows (orchestras) and after earning fame, joined the group of Kalyanji-Anandji, a legendary music direction duo. He did a lot of shows and world tours with them, one of his first big tours being with Amitabh Bachchan in 1982. Since he became an instant hit at orchestras and was unable to find time, another comedian who substituted him by the name of Johnny Fever evolved. However, Fever's fame was short-lived as Raju Srivastav came to Mumbai during the same time and started filling gaps of Johnny Lever at orchestras. During this period he learned a lot from his mentor Kalyanji, who was described by Lever as a great philosopher and a very humorous person. At one of his shows, actor Sunil Dutt noticed his talent and potential and offered him his first movie Dard Ka Rishta. In the 1980s, he released his mimicry/comedy album, Hansee Ke Hungame, which became a hit in India and the world over, increasing his fame to another level. During this time period, he also did few commercials for Kachua chhap incense, directed by Shekhar Kapoor. In 1986, he performed in a charity show called \"Hope 86\", in front of the whole Hindi film industry as a filler and was loved by audience. His talent was recognized, which resulted in producer Gul Anand offering him a film called Jalwa with Naseeruddin Shah. He is considered an influential Indian comedian who has been cited as inspiration by many other comics. He has received 13 Filmfare Awards nominations in Best Comedian Category, and has won the award twice.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyMTQzMjk1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5MTMzOTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505323","name":"Johnny Lever","idIMDB":"nm0505323"},"actorId":"nm0505323","character":"Hussain Bhai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Farid Currim","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193020","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Farid Currim is an actor, known for Le commando de sa majesté (1980), Saas Bahu Aur Sensex (2008) and Dulha Mil Gaya (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193020","name":"Farid Currim","idIMDB":"nm0193020"},"actorId":"nm0193020","character":"Sam","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pratap Faujdan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4561339","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Pratap Faujdan is an actor, known for Dulha Mil Gaya (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4561339","name":"Pratap Faujdan","idIMDB":"nm4561339"},"actorId":"nm4561339","character":"Punjab Cab-driver","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mohammad S.

Randhir played the lead hero in 34 films from 1971-1987 and had 23 of them as box-office hits. Randhir Kapoor was 3rd highest paid actor from 1971-1975 with Dharmendra and 4th from 1976-1983. Randhir has 24 solo hero films from 1971-1987 and of them 15 were box-office hits. Of the 24 solo hero films of Randhir, Raj Kapoor played supporting role in 2 films -Dharam Karam and Kal Aaj Aur Kal and Shammi Kapoor played supporting role in 2 films Harjaee and Mama Bhanja and Sanjeev Kumar played in supporting role in Biwi O Biwi. Randhir did 10 multi-star films of which 8 were box-office hits. He was born in Bombay on February 15, 1947, in this Punjabi-speaking family, to be the first son to Raj and mom, Krishna. His nickname is Daboo. As a kid he made 30-second appearance in a song in Shree 420. Later made an appearance on the silver screen as a child artiste and was credited as 'Master Daboo' in 'Do Ustad (1959)' which starred his father and Madhubala in the lead roles.As a 20 year old in 1968 he assisted director Lekh Tandon in making Jhuk Gaya Asmaan. Subsequently, he made his rather dramatic entry into Bollywood in 'Kal Aaj Aur Kal' - a movie that was released in 1971 and starred three generations of the Kapoor family, namely his grand-dad, Prithviraj, a legend unto himself, his dad, Raj, as well as his college sweetheart and to-be wife, Babita, an actress in her own right, who is the daughter of actor, Hari Shivdasani and also the cousin of popular actress Sadhana Shivdasani. Kal Aaj Aur Kal, which had Randhir as the lead hero and was directed by himself , went on to be hit, followed closely by 3 more consecutive hits 'Jeet' ,'Raampur Ka Lakshman' and 'Jawani Diwani'. After which remake of MGR's hit 1971 film Rickshawkaran was made in Hindi in 1973 with Randhir as the lead hero opposite new heroine Neetu Singh but the film flopped though its music was popular. In 1974 he had 2 big hits - Hamrahi and the 2 hero film Haath Ki Safai as hits but Dil Deewana failed to be a hit at the box-office, in-spite of its music being better than its prequel Jawani Deewani. In 1975, his 2 solo lead hero films were hits -Lafange and Ponga Pandit but his other 2 movies were not successful - Dafa 302 and Dharam Karam. Though Dharam Karam developed a cult following later and is considered a classic but film was called by critics-reviewers at the time of its release as falling short of the expectations from RK banner. From 1976 till 1981, Randhir had solo hero hit films like - Khalifa, Aaj Ka Mahaatma, Bhanwar, Ram Bharose, Dhongee and his multi-star films like Chacha Bhatija, Mama Bhatija, Heeralal Pannalal, Dhyanu Bhagat also known as Bhakti Mein Shakti, Kasme Vaade, Chor Ke Ghar Chor, Biwi O Biwi were hits too. All of a sudden after Harjaee in 1981 became a disaster, in-spite of having many hits under his belt, film offers for him as the solo hero or in multi-star cast films got reduced. According to Randhir, had Harjaee been made better with proper ending and good editing, the film would have been big hit for its had a great cast and nice music. Another film which was started in 1976 titled Nikkamma got a delayed release in 1983 with title as Janejaan, which was a dud. Even the 2 hero films- Sawaal and Pukar - where Randhir performances were appreciated by critics - became box-office flops whereas Humse Na Jeeta Koi was average success in 1983. As he achieved great success as an actor from 1970-1981 but after offers as an actor dried up from 1982, he turned a producer - producing Ram Teri Ganga Maili in 1985 which was a blockbuster and directed 'Henna' in 1991 which starred his younger brother, Rishi, and Pakistani actress, Zeba Bakhtiar and was was again a blockbuster. The film Heena resulted in a trip to Pakistan, where he was treated royally by the then Pakistani President Nawaz Sharif, who turned out to be a fan of his dad Raj, his uncles Shammi and Shashi and also of Randhir himself. He produced PremGranth in 1996 and Aa Ab Laut Chalen in 1999 with Rajesh Khanna in the lead. Later as an actor, Randhir made comeback with 'Mother' in 1999; in 2003 with 'Armaan'; and 'Housefull' in 2010.From 2010, Randhir has been getting many offers as supporting actor. Randhir married Sindhi-speaking girlfriend Babita during the year 1971 and their first daughter, Karisma, was born on 25th June 1974. Their second and last child, Kareena, was born on 21st September 1980. Babita and Randhir were happily married couple from 1971-1987, but things changed after Randhir's career as an actor slumped after 1983 and Babita wanted her daughter Karishma to follow in her footsteps, that lead to considerable strife in their relationship, and ultimately leading to a separation in 1988, with both his daughters moving out with their mother. Randhir and Babita started living separately from 1988 but they never divorced each-other as both continued to love each-other. During 2004, the couple patched-up their differences especially in the light of the fact that both their daughters had achieved considerable fame and success. Randhir had arranged Karisma's marriage with Amitabh Bachchan's son, Abhishek, followed by an engagement, which was unfortunately broken. Karisma went on to get married to Delhi-based Sanjay Kapur in 2003. It was also during the year 2007 that he appeared on a popular TV show 'Koffee With Karan' along with his sister, Rima; his brothers, as well as sister-in-law, Neetu Singh. He became a grandfather on 11 March 2005 and 12 March 2010 when Karishma gave birth to Samaira and Kiaan respectively.His 2nd daughter also became an actress by making her debut in 2000 and married Saif Ali Khan in 2012. Randhir is still the head of RK Studios, a part of which has been converted into a museum with mementos of his family's movies.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEzZDA2NzYtZTIwOS00NGYzLWE4ODEtYzJjZTM2OGMwNzMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0196380","name":"Randhir Kapoor","nicknames":["Daboo"],"idIMDB":"nm0196380"},"actorId":"nm0196380","character":"Surajratan Dhanraj","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1182884","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182884","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":[{"money":"£71,760","country":"UK","day":"10","month":"01","year":"2010","remarks":"48 Screens"}],"gross":[{"money":"£71,760","country":"UK","day":"10","month":"01","year":"2010","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":[{"money":"£71,760","country":"UK","day":"10","month":"01","year":"2010","remarks":"48 Screens"}],"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 hr 32 min (152 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.4","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"1,997","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0084248","name":"Insight Productions"},{"idCompany":"co0317955","name":"Intech"},{"idCompany":"co0266754","name":"Morpheus Media Ventures"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 01:40:11"}}
