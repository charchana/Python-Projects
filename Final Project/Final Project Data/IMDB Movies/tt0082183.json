Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"François Perrin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027590","main":true},{"actorName":"Gérard Depardieu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDU4OTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwODY0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 December 1948","placeOfBirth":" Châteauroux, Indre, France","birthName":"Gérard Xavier Marcel Depardieu","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Gérard Depardieu was born in Châteauroux, Indre, France, to Anne Jeanne Josèphe (Marillier) and René Maxime Lionel Depardieu, who was a metal worker and fireman. Young delinquent and wanderer in the past, Depardieu started his acting career at the small traveling theatre \"Cafe de la Gare\", along with Patrick Dewaere and Miou-Miou. After minor roles in cinema, at last, he got his chance in Bertrand Blier's Going Places (1974). That film established a new type of hero in the French cinema and the actor's popularity grew enormously. Later, he diversified his screen image and became the leading French actor of the 80s and 90s. He was twice awarded a César as Best Actor for Le dernier métro (1980) and Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), also received an Oscar nomination for \"Cyrano\" and a number of awards at international film festivals. In 1996, he was distinguished by the highest French title of \"Chevalier du Légion d'Honneur\". He married Elisabeth Depardieu in 1971, and they divorced in 1996; she appeared with him in Jean de Florette (1986) and Manon of the Spring (1986); their children Guillaume Depardieu and Julie Depardieu are both actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDU4OTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwODY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367","name":"Gérard Depardieu","idIMDB":"nm0000367"},"actorId":"nm0000367","character":"Campana","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0034343","main":true},{"actorName":"Pedro Armendáriz Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001917","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwODc5MjA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQzOTY5Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 April 1940","placeOfBirth":" Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico","birthName":"Pedro Armendáriz Bohr","bio":"Pedro Armendáriz Jr. was born on April 6, 1940 in Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico as Pedro Armendáriz Bohr.

Following his studies at the Instituto Andrés Soler of the Asociación Nacional de Actores in Mexico, he was chosen for his first film, Bridge in the Jungle, based on B. Traven's novel, and starring legendary director/actor John Huston. Calderón 13 years later would work with Huston again, this time under Huston's direction as one of the sinister murderers in the classic Under the Volcano with Albert Finney and Jacqueline Bisset. In television in this same period, he played the guest stars \"Malavida Valdése\" and \"El Cajón\" in both of the two season-initial double episodes of the very popular \"The A-Team\" with George Peppard and Mr. T. But principally he is well-respected and widely recognized for all of his long career of some 50 films. Calderon has worked with other out-standing directors besides Huston: Sergio Leone, Ron Howard, Luis Puenzo, R. Mann and many others. Since beginning his career he has worked with actors such as Anthony Quinn (Children of Sánchez), Peter Falk and Alan Arkin (The In-Laws), Robert Mitchum, James Coburn and Rod Steiger (Duck, you Sucker), Gerard Depardieu and Pierre Richard (Le Chevre) and Gregory Peck, Jane Fonda and Jimmie Smits (Old Gringo). He is perhaps most well known for his role as the first alien, \"Head on a Stick\", in the original blockbuster Men in Black, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. More recently he has worked with Cate Blanchett, Tommy Lee Jones and Aaron Eckhart in The Missing, and played \"Captain Villanueva\", the Spanish pirate lord in Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End. His latest film is The Little Fockers, the comedy starring Robert de Niro, Ben Stiller, and Barbra Streisand.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NzMyODI0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIyODQwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0129564","name":"Sergio Calderón","idIMDB":"nm0129564"},"actorId":"nm0129564","character":"Prisoner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michel Robin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0732220","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ1NTUxOTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0MzU5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR21,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 October 1930","placeOfBirth":" Reims, Marne, France","birthName":"Michel Jacques François Robin","bio":"Michel Robin was born on October 13, 1930 in Reims, Marne, France as Michel Jacques François Robin.
