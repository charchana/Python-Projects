On the screen, she plays in some 'Denis Arcand' movies such as Réjeanne Padovani (1973) and for 'Anne Claire Poirier' before directing her first short in 1975 Anastasie oh ma cherie. But it is La cuisine rouge in 1979 about the revolt of women against their macho friend in a party which is seen as a stepping stone for \"women in cinema\". She went back to acting for Léa Pool and Claude Jutra, directing only one feature, a TV movie in 1991. Her next big screen release came in 1993: Le sexe des étoiles (1993) on the relation between a daughter and a father who had a sex change.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047575","name":"Paule Baillargeon","idIMDB":"nm0047575"},"actorId":"nm0047575","character":"La dame à la minerve","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0819953","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0819953","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 44 min (104 min) (Toronto International) (Canada)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":["Arriflex Cameras"],"laboratory":["Cité Lab, Canada"],"filmLength":["2,865 m (Portugal, 35 mm)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Super 35"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm (anamorphic)"]},"rating":"6.9","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Laval, Québec, Canada"}],"awards":[{"award":"Directors Guild of Canada 2008","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated DGC Team Award","categories":[{"category":"Feature Film","names":[{"name":"François Séguin","id":"nm0845337","role":"Production Designer"},{"name":"Guy Pigeon","id":"nm1263980","role":"Art Director"}]}]}]},{"award":"Genie Awards 2008","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Genie","categories":[{"category":"Best Motion Picture","names":[{"name":"Denise Robert","id":"nm0730629","role":null},{"name":"Daniel Louis","id":"nm0521858","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role","names":[{"name":"Marc Labrèche","id":"nm0479745","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Achievement in Direction","names":[{"name":"Denys Arcand","id":"nm0000780","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Screenplay, Original","names":[{"name":"Denys Arcand","id":"nm0000780","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Jutra Awards 2008","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Jutra","categories":[{"category":"Best Make-Up (Meilleur Maquillage)","names":[{"name":"Diane Simard","id":"nm0799328","role":null}]}]},{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Jutra","categories":[{"category":"Best Achievement in Directing (Meilleure Réalisation)","names":[{"name":"Denys Arcand","id":"nm0000780","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Film (Meilleur Film)","names":[{"name":"Denise Robert","id":"nm0730629","role":null},{"name":"Daniel Louis","id":"nm0521858","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Meilleur Acteur)","names":[{"name":"Marc Labrèche","id":"nm0479745","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role (Meilleure Actrice)","names":[{"name":"Sylvie Léonard","id":"nm0529635","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Screenplay (Meilleur Scénario)","names":[{"name":"Denys Arcand","id":"nm0000780","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"2,459","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0021150","name":"Cinémaginaire Inc."},{"idCompany":"co0215787","name":"Mon Voisin Productions"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["civil servant","conquest","farce","mother son relationship","fantasy life","fantasy sequence","daydreaming","daydreamer","daydream","france","french","realtor","estate agent","sex in public","spontaneous sex","dream within a dream","sex in shower","doggystyle sex","fully clothed sex","having sex with skirt hiked up","panties hit the floor","canadian stereotype","group sex","lesbian kiss","breast suckling","bare breasts","bare midriff","sexual fantasy","misogyny","rape","rape joke","rape fantasy","fivesome","lipstick lesbian","lesbian stereotype","female rear nudity","female nudity","implied infidelity","family relationships","shower","speed dating","tournament","jousting","montreal quebec canada","lesbian friend","imaginary friend","infidelity","marital discord","marital problem","day at work","death of parent","nursing home","dying mother","father daughter relationship","husband wife relationship","death of mother"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 23:21:18"}}
