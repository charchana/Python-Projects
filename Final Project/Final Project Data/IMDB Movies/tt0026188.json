For sure her father was a banker but he was also an amateur pianist. As for her mother, she was a housewife but also a very talented opera singer who had given up her career for the joys of matrimony and motherhood. It does not come as a surprise, under such circumstances, that the little girl's singing capacities were soon discovered. At eight she was already on a scene singing an aria from \"The Barber of Seville\". A critic attended the show and was impressed by her performance. He introduced her to the director of the Magyar Theater, where she landed her first contract. As of the age of 10 she was hailed as Hungary's \"national idol\". And it was not long before her triumph became international. An operetta, \"Pogasza\", was written specially for the crystal-clear-voiced little singer. Among others, she played the role of the doll in \"Tales of Hoffmann\" and starred in \"Das Veilchen vom Montmartre\" by Kalman. With the advent of sound films, she found herself very much in demand in the 1930s, bringing her beautiful voice and looks to yet more delighted viewers. It is on the set of \"Mein Herz ruft nach dir\" that she met Jan Kiepura, another successful opera and operetta singer. Although it was not love at first sight, Jan and Martha gradually fell in love, married two years later, had two sons and were separated only by death with the demise of Jan in 1966. In 1938, the couple fled Austria after its annexation by Hitler and settled down in the South of France first then in the USA. Martha made fewer movies but kept on singing. For instance she co-starred in \"The merry Widow\" in Broadway for three years with Jan Kiepura. She became an American citizen in the fifties and currently lives in Rye, new York.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI1NWUzMTEtMjNjNC00OGY1LTg1YjYtYzM1OGU5Zjc2NjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0250964","name":"Mártha Eggerth","nicknames":["The Callas of Operetta"],"idIMDB":"nm0250964"},"actorId":"nm0250964","character":"Maddalena Fumarol","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sandro Palmieri","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0658594","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Sandro Palmieri is an actor, known for Casta diva (1935), Orpheus: The Day Before (1994) and The Magnificent Rogue (1935).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0658594","name":"Sandro Palmieri","idIMDB":"nm0658594"},"actorId":"nm0658594","character":"Vincenzo Bellini","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0272595","main":true},{"actorName":"Gualtiero Tumiati","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876522","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 May 1876","placeOfBirth":" Ferrara, Italy","bio":"Gualtiero Tumiati was born on May 8, 1876 in Ferrara, Italy.
