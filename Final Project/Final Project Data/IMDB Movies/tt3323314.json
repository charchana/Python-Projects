Afraid of loneliness Tommy asks the married stage manager Mary Kay to join him on tour . Whilst Dove is concerned that his drinking and late nights are damaging to his health and a sign for him to give up, Mary is encouraging - partly as she sees Tommy as being helpful to her husband's writing aspirations.

She trained at the Drama Centre London. She began her career on stage in the UK. She won the Manchester Evening News' Best Actress Award for her performance in the National Theatre's \"Blood Wedding\" and the Ian Charleson award for classical acting for playing \"Rose Trelawney\" in \"Trelawney of the Wells\". Helen's theatre work has continued to win her critical praise and a large fan base through such work as the Royal Shakespeare Company's \"Les Enfant du Paradis\" opposite Joseph Fiennes, Rupert Graves and James Purefoy. At the Almeida Theatre, her productions have included \"The Triumph of Love\" opposite Chiwetel Ejiofor and the radical verse production, \"Five Gold Rings\", opposite Damian Lewis. Helen has also worked extensively at the Donmar Warehouse playing lead roles in \"How I Learnt to Drive\", \"Old Times\" directed by Roger Michel, and in Sam Mendes' farewell double bill of \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Uncle Vanya\" (a triumph in both London and New York). For her performance in \"Twelfth Night\", Helen was nominated for the Evening Standard Best Actress Award, and the New York Drama Desk Awards. Helen also found time to found the production company \"The Public\" with Michael Sheen, producing new work at the Liverpool Everyman, The Ambassadors and the Donmar (in which she also starred). With over twenty productions under her belt, Mike Coveney recently wrote \"We celebrate the careers of great actors Olivier, Ashcroft, Richardson, Gielgud, Dench, the Redgraves, Gambon, Walter, Sher, Russell Beale and McCrory\". On the small screen, Helen's first television film, Karl Francis' Screen Two: Streetlife (1995) with Rhys Ifans, won her the Welsh BAFTA, Monte Carlo Best Actress Award and the Royal Television Society's Best Actress Award, for her extraordinary performance as \"Jo\". The Edinburgh Film Festival wrote \"simply the best performance this year\". She went on to win Critics Circle Best Actress Award for her role as the barrister \"Rose Fitzgerald\" in the Channel 4 series North Square (2000), having been previously nominated for her performance in The Fragile Heart (1996). Helen has shown her diversity as an actress, appearing in comedies such as Lucky Jim (2003) with Stephen Tompkinson or Dead Gorgeous (2002) with Fay Ripley, as well as dramas such as Joe Wright's The Last King (2003) (for which she was nominated for the LA Television Awards) and Anna Karenina (2000).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwOTMwNjEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUwMjc4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0567031","name":"Helen McCrory","idIMDB":"nm0567031"},"actorId":"nm0567031","character":"Mary Kay","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Amanda Redman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714985","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjA1MTQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ1NTgxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 August 1957","placeOfBirth":" Brighton, East Sussex, England, UK","birthName":"Amanda Jacqueline Redman","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Amanda Redman was born on August 12, 1957 in Brighton, East Sussex, England as Amanda Jacqueline Redman.

His first regular television appearance was in 1979 when he appeared alongside Rikki Fulton in the BBC sketch show 'Scotch & Wry'. As he became more recognized, he was in demand for more television work. In 1986, he was cast in 'Naked Video' ( which itself started as a radio show entitled 'Naked Radio' ) alongside the likes of Andy Gray, Elaine C. Smith and Tony Roper among others. This show saw the creation of some of his finest characters such as string vested drunkard 'Rab C. Nesbitt' and 'The Baldy Man', the vain half wit with an unconvincing comb over. His talent for visual comedy was not unnoticed by the production team, particularly not by writer Phil Differ, who wrote for him 'The Man In The Photo Booth' ( which was a direct life from the 'photo booth' sketch in 'Naked Video' featuring 'The Baldy Man' ). Incidentally, the 'Rab C. Nesbitt' character became so popular that in 1988 he was awarded his own show which has since notched up ten series, with a special episode ending in 2014. The well loved Scottish actor currently lives in France with his wife, actress Vicki Burton.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NDY4MDIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA1MjkwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279524","name":"Gregor Fisher","nicknames":["Fisher"],"idIMDB":"nm0279524"},"actorId":"nm0279524","character":"Miff Ferrie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0387570","main":true},{"actorName":"Andy Rush","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4170801","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExODkxOTI2MDReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDU0MDc0MzQ@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Andy Rush is an actor, known for Tommy Cooper: Not Like That, Like This (2014), Carnage: Swallowing the Past (2017) and ID2: Shadwell Army (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExODkxOTI2MDReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDU0MDc0MzQ@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4170801","name":"Andy Rush","idIMDB":"nm4170801"},"actorId":"nm4170801","character":"Tom Junior","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Ritter","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728795","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MjE5OTk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAzNzY5MjE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Versatile character actor Paul Ritter was born in Kent on March 5th 1966 and, whilst not from a show business family, there are strong thespian connections as his mother was a class-mate of comic actor Bernard Cribbins and his father attended the same school as the great comedian and writer Eric Sykes - whom Paul would portray in the TV drama 'Tommy Cooper: Not Like That, Like This.' In the last decade of the twentieth century and beginning of the 2000s he built up an enviable roster of stage roles, working with the National Theatre in 'The Royal Hunt of the Sun', 'All My Sons', 'Coram Boy', 'The Hot-House', 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night- time' and more recently as John Major in 'The Audience'. For the Royal Shakespeare company he has taken part in a host of classical plays including 'Troilus and Cressida' and 'The White Devil' and in 2009, along with co-stars Amanda Root, Jessica Hynes and Stephen Mangan was nominated for a Tony award when the Old Vic's revival of 'The Norman Conquests' played on Broadway. In the second decade of the twenty-first century he has become one of television's most welcomely ubiquitous actors in such varied parts as a Scots vicar in 'Mapp and Lucia', a mother-dominated gay spy in 'The Game', in police dramas 'Vera' and 'No Offence' and as Pistol in the BBC's adaptation of 'Henry IV', for which performance the Telegraph newspaper described him as 'an actor destined for greatness soon'. However he is arguably best known for playing eccentric, usually shirtless Martin Goodman hosting his 'bambinos' for their 'Friday Night Dinner' in the Channel 4 sitcom of that name.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MjE5OTk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAzNzY5MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728795","name":"Paul Ritter","idIMDB":"nm0728795"},"actorId":"nm0728795","character":"Eric Sykes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0066711","main":true},{"actorName":"Bob Golding","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1019776","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Bob Golding is known for his work on Tweenies (1999), Ronja, the Robber's Daughter (2014) and Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon (2003).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1019776","name":"Bob Golding","idIMDB":"nm1019776"},"actorId":"nm1019776","character":"Eric Morecambe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0213622","main":true},{"actorName":"Jordan Metcalfe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1508111","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1986","placeOfBirth":" Hull, England, UK","bio":"Jordan Metcalfe was born on May 24, 1986 in Hull, England.
