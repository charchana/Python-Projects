Each of the five women, different from the other in temperament and capability, is the emotional support system, although at times reluctantly, for each other, with the eldest assuming the role of a 'somewhat meddling' overseer. But then into this comes an elderly brother, a priest too senile to perform his clerical functions, who has \"come home to die\" after a lifetime in Africa; as well, there also arrives the boy's father, riding up on a motorcycle, only to announce that he's on his way to Spain to fight against Franco. Nevertheless, life goes on for the five sisters, although undeniably affected by the presence of the two men, they continue to cope as a close-knit unit... until something happens that disrupts the very fabric of that cohesiveness beyond repair.","simplePlot":"Five unmarried sisters make the most of their simple existence in rural Ireland in the 1930s.","actors":[{"actorName":"Gerard McSorley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574561","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxODQ2ODc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA3NDIzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR10,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1950","placeOfBirth":" Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, UK","bio":"Gerard McSorley was born in 1950 in Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.

Meryl was born Mary Louise Streep in 1949 in Summit, New Jersey, to Mary Wolf (Wilkinson), a commercial artist, and Harry William Streep, Jr., a pharmaceutical executive. Her father was of German and Swiss-German descent, and her mother had English, Irish, and German ancestry. Meryl's early performing ambitions leaned toward the opera. She became interested in acting while a student at Vassar and upon graduation she enrolled in the Yale School of Drama. She gave an outstanding performance in her first film role, Julia (1977), and the next year she was nominated for her first Oscar for her role in The Deer Hunter (1978). She went on to win the Academy Award for her performances in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Sophie's Choice (1982), in which she gave a heart-wrenching portrayal of an inmate mother in a Nazi death camp. A perfectionist in her craft and meticulous and painstaking in her preparation for her roles, Meryl turned out a string of highly acclaimed performances over the next decade in great films like Silkwood (1983); Out of Africa (1985); Ironweed (1987); and A Cry in the Dark (1988). Her career declined slightly in the early 1990s as a result of her inability to find suitable parts, but she shot back to the top in 1995 with her performance as Clint Eastwood's married lover in The Bridges of Madison County (1995) and as the prodigal daughter in Marvin's Room (1996). In 1998 she made her first venture into the area of producing, and was the executive producer for the moving ...First Do No Harm (1997). A realist when she talks about her future years in film, she remarked that \"...no matter what happens, my work will stand...\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Mjk5MDExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000658","name":"Meryl Streep","idIMDB":"nm0000658"},"actorId":"nm0000658","character":"Kate Mundy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0406121","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Gambon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002091","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3OTc4MTgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAxNjA3Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 October 1940","placeOfBirth":" Cabra, Dublin, Ireland","birthName":"Michael John Gambon","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Sir Michael Gambon was born in Cabra, Dublin, Ireland, to Mary (Hoare), a seamstress, and Edward Gambon, an engineer.

Little detail is given on him, yet he has appeared in many well-known films and television series alongside a variety of actors. Kavanagh began his career with the Irish comedy, Paddy (1970), where he played the small role of \"Willie Egan\". That same year, he played another small role in the World War II film, L'évasion du capitaine Schlütter (1970), which is about a P.O.W. camp, in Scotland, whose prisoners are preparing an escape. The next twelve years brought Kavanagh no new films, though he continued to act on stage. Finally, he decided to return to screen acting with the theatrical film, The Ballroom of Romance (1982), which put him in a romance with accomplished actress Brenda Fricker. The film was followed up with the small film, Attracta (1983), and the made-for-television movie, The Country Girls (1984), starring Sam Neill. Kavanagh's next theatrical film was one of the most famous films of his career: the Irish film Cal (1984), starring Helen Mirren and John Lynch. The film was about a young member of the IRA (Lynch) who is seeking to get out of the organization. He meets the widow of one of the IRA's victims (Mirren) and begin a love affair. Moving on from this film, Kavanagh acted in a number of films and television series. He participated in the action film, The Joyriders (1999), the crime drama, Bellman and True (1987), the independent film, 4 Play: In the Border Country (1991), and the thriller, The Fantasist (1986), among others. Kavanagh's career picked up considerably in the mid-nineties. He acted alongside such classic actors as Mia Farrow and Jim Broadbent in the John Irvin film, Widows' Peak (1994). Kavanagh then guest-starred in the Sharpe series (starring Sean Bean and Hugh Fraser), where he played the holy man \"Father Michael Curtis\". That same year, he acted in the most talked about epic of its time; Mel Gibson's Braveheart (1995). Starring Gibson, Angus Macfadyen and Brendan Gleeson, Kavangh acted as one of the nobles who routinely changed sides from Scotland to England in the Scottish wars of independence. The film won Best Picture and Best Director, and was a smash hit. After this fantastic success, Kavanagh acted in Some Mother's Son (1996), a prison film which was written by Jim Sheridan, and reunited with Brenda Fricker in Pete's Meteor (1998). He continued to act in other films throughout the nineties and, as the new millennium dawned, Kavanagh continued on to new projects. After a number of smaller films, Kavanagh acted in another historical epic; the mighty Oliver Stone film, Alexander (2004), starring Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins. Kavanagh played the role of \"Parmenion\", the old general who questions Alexander's actions. After a plot to kill the young leader is foiled, Parmenion is accused of being the mastermind behind it and is murdered. While the film was a triumph overseas, its domestic budget was a fraction of the budget, and received negative reviews for a number of different reasons. After this, Kavanagh acted in Brian De Palma's murder film, Le dahlia noir (2006), which failed at the box office. Kavanagh has rebounded with the successful television series, Les Tudors (2007). Starring fellow Alexander (2004) cast member Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the series plays out the story of England's turmoil in the time of Henry the Eighth and his life as he breaks from the Catholic Church.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5ODY3Nzc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMyMTUwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0442559","name":"John Kavanagh","idIMDB":"nm0442559"},"actorId":"nm0442559","character":"Father Carlin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marie Mullen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0612027","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1953","placeOfBirth":" Ireland","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Marie Mullen was born in 1953 in Ireland.
