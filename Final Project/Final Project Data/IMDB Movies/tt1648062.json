Born in Green Lake County, Wisconsin, Whirry graduated from high school and packed her bags for New York. She trained at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts during the 1980s and began her career in Off-Broadway productions. When Steven Seagal came to town during the casting for his 1991 movie Out for Justice (1991), Whirry won the role of Terry Malloy, a cocktail waitress. She left for LA. Following this small role, she auditioned for and won the part of Joanna Coles in the erotic thriller Animal Instincts (1992). Directed by Gregory Dark, the movie capitalized on the direct-to-video market and the popularity of steamy movies in the early 1990s. Animal Instincts (1992) revolved around a couple's bid to spice up their marriage through voyeuristic sexual adventures. The film was a hit. Over the following years, Whirry worked with Gregory Dark on more films in the same vein. Animal Instincts II (1994) and Body of Influence (1993) are well known. She also appeared in Exit (1996), Ringer (1996), Mirror Images II (1993), and Private Obsession (1995) among others. She was, and still is, regarded as an icon of the erotic thriller genre. Debate continues as to whether one prefers Shannon Whirry or Shannon Tweed. In the mid-90s, Whirry broke away from the confines of the genre, and appeared in movies with more focus on action and adventure, as well as appearing in numerous TV shows in guest spots. TV roles have included Murder One (1995), Nash Bridges (1996), V.I.P. (1998), and ER (1994). Whirry was also a regular on the TV show Mike Hammer, Private Eye (1997). Despite some Hollywood attention and a variety of roles (including a cameo in the Jim Carrey vehicle Me, Myself & Irene (2000)) Whirry felt that roles were drying up in LA, where the focus was, and remains, on youth. She left LA in 2004. These days, Shannon Whirry lives in the Phoenix area of Arizona. She can be seen in challenging roles on the stage with iTheatre Collaborative or Nearly Naked Theatre. Her stage roles have garnered her much acclaim. Small roles continue in front of the camera, mostly filmed locally. She also has appeared in TV commercials. She is married and has no children. In May 2009, Whirry can be seen in \"Bug\" at the Herberger Theatre Center in Phoenix. Whilst fans are sure to be pleased that her career is continuing and flourishing, some surely wouldn't mind another Animal Instincts (1992) sequel.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NjQ0MjM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924204","name":"Shannon Whirry","idIMDB":"nm0924204"},"actorId":"nm0924204","character":"Sarah Dust","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ariel Myers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5306649","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ariel Myers is an actress, known for Cowboys Vs.

Growing up primarily in Wichita, Kansas, Roy attended a different school every year until high school. Coming from a single-parent household, he and his twin sister were latch-key kids while their mother worked two and three jobs to pay the bills. In the early 1970s, Roy signed up with the Big Brothers of Sedgwick County program and was blessed to be matched with four different \"Big Brothers\" over ten years. This program helps youth in high-risk environments see a better way. His \"Big Brothers\" were instrumental in helping him walk a straight path, especially his last BB, Bill. He graduated from Wichita South High School in 1983 and went on to Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas, graduating with a BA in Business in 1987. During his Freshman year, Roy was bitten by the acting bug. For the next four years, he spent time running lights and sound, building stage backdrops, and acting in several plays and musicals. He was inducted into the Alpha Psi Omega national honorary drama fraternity and was even pictured in an issue of Playbill. In 1987, he was awarded \"Outstanding Senior in Drama.\" After graduation, acting took a back seat as he began his career and life...until 2001, when he moved his family to Tucson, Arizona to enjoy the over 300 days of sunshine. In 2003, he made the decision to seek out an agent and go after one of his lifelong dreams...becoming a professional actor and model. Since that time, he has acted in over a dozen independent films and two TV shows. He has also been in many commercials, including Tucson Electric Power's \"Stay Away, Stay Alive\" public service announcement which has been broadcasting for over ten years during the infamous \"monsoon\" seasons in southern Arizona each year. In 2006, Roy co-authored and published a science-fiction novel with his good friend, Ed, titled \"I'm Back...and the Truth Hurts!\" A novel by Joseph Edwards. In 2011, they published their second book, \"The Nameless Few,\" as an e-book on Kindle. Roy is also a 2nd degree Black Belt in the art of Kenpo. He has been married to his wife, Darla, for close to three decades and is blessed to have two very wonderful and talented children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNzEzNjU5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkzMTU5NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2136894","name":"Roy C.
