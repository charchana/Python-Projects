Her first audition was for a TV-commercial - \"Got Milk?!\", and after not getting that job, she didn't have to wait long for her next opportunity, which was the part as the young Rose in the civil-war flick The Rose and the Jackal (1990), which also starred Christopher Reeve. In 1991, she took her first step towards big fame and landed the role as the tomboyish Al on the Friday night hit Step by Step (1991). During the sitcom's long run, Christine gracefully grew up, graduated from high school in 1997 and made various appearances on other television shows. When Step by Step (1991) was cancelled in 1998, Christine, while attending UCLA and majoring in film, looked for other film roles. She landed jobs in independent films such as Big Monster on Campus (2000) and Finding Kelly (2000). Whatever It Takes (2000) was Christine's first wide theatrical film release. Since then, she has had a slew of independent coming-of-age films along with guest appearances on such hit shows as Boston Public (2000), and Opposite Sex (2000).

This African-American basketball player turned actor first popped up in minor roles such as a prison guard in Runaway Train (1985), as Andy Garcia's bodyguard in 8 Million Ways to Die (1986) and Powers Boothe's bodyguard in Extreme Prejudice (1987). \"Tiny\" Lister also had a stint in both the WWE (Formerly WWF) & WCW professional wrestling circuits in the late 1980s appearing under the name \"Zeus\" and \"ZGangsta\". His wrestling exploits can be seen on Summerslam (1989), Survivor Series (1989) and WWF Superstars (1986). However, unlike many musclebound athletic types, \"Tiny\" Lister is a reasonable actor, and he has managed to notch up appearances in over 80 movies, expanding upon his original \"fierce bodyguard\" roles to now include comedic and rather quirky performances in films such as Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), the African-American western Posse (1993), as the Federated Territories President in the science fiction epic The Fifth Element (1997), the cult comedy Friday (1995) and its sequel, Next Friday (2000). Lister has also recently appeared on screen with Adam Sandler in Little Nicky (2000), and with Mike Myers in Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), plus he's been seen in a slew of B-horror films including Soulkeeper (2001), Hellborn (2003) and Dracula 3000 (2004).

At age 10, Adam had a cache of comic books, and \"Batman\" made a big impression on him--the comic hero was part bat-man (a la Count Dracula) and part world's greatest detective (a la Charlie Chan and Sherlock Holmes). When his mother remarried to a Dr. Paul Flothow, she took Adam and his younger brother, John, to Seattle. At age 14, Adam attended Lakeside School, then went to Whitman College, where he got a degree in literature and psychology. During his last year of college, he also married 17-year-old Billie Lou Yeager. Adam got a job as a disc jockey at a local radio station, then enrolled at Stanford for post-grad courses. Drafted into the army, he spent the next two years starting military television stations, first at San Luis Obispo, California, then at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Afterwards, Adam and his wife toured Europe, visiting Germany, Switzerland and Italy's Isle of Capri. When the money ran out, he joined a childhood and college buddy, Carl Hebenstreit, who was starring in the kiddie program \"The Kini Popo Show\" in Hawaii. Adam would eventually replace Carl but not the other star, Peaches the Chimp. In 1956, he got a divorce and married a beautiful girl, originally from Tahiti, named Ngatokoruaimatauaia Frisbie Dawson (he called her \"Nga\" for short). They had a daughter, Jonelle, (born 1957) and a son, Hunter, (born 1958). In 1959, Adam came to Hollywood. He adopted the stage name \"Adam West\", which fit his roles, as he was in some westerns. After seven years in Tinseltown, he achieved fame in his signature role as Batman, in the wildly popular ABC-TV series Batman (1966) (though he has over 60 movie and over 80 television guest appearance credits, \"Batman\" is what the fans remember him for). The series, which lasted three seasons, made him not just nationally but internationally famous. The movie version, Batman: The Movie (1966), earned Adam the \"Most Promising New Star\" award in 1967. The downside was that the \"Batman\" fame was partly responsible for ruining his marriage, and he would be typecast and almost unemployable for a while after the series ended (he did nothing but personal appearances for two years). In 1970, he met and then married Marcelle Tagand Lear, and picked up two stepchildren, Moya and Jill. In addition, they had two children of their own: Nina West in 1976 and Perrin in 1979. You can't keep a good actor down -- Adam's career took off again, and he has been in 50 projects since then: movies, television movies and sometimes doing voices on television series. Adam wrote his autobiography \"Back to the Batcave\" (1994). One of his most prized possessions is a drawing of Batman by Bob Kane with the inscription \"To my buddy, Adam, who breathed life into my pen and ink creation\". Since 2000, West has made guest appearances on the animated series Family Guy (1999), on which he played Mayor Adam West, the lunatic mayor of Quahog, Rhode Island.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY0OTQxMTI3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTA5MzM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001842","name":"Adam West","idIMDB":"nm0001842"},"actorId":"nm0001842","character":"Manbat / Cab Driver","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"June Lockhart","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001478","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Nzk3NzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI3MjY5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 June 1925","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Born in New York City on June 25, 1925, the daughter of actors Gene Lockhart and Kathleen Lockhart, June Lockhart made her professional debut at age eight in a Metropolitan Opera production of \"Peter Ibbetson\", playing Mimsey in the dream sequence. In the mid-1930s, the Lockharts relocated to California, where father Gene enjoyed a long career as one of the screen's great character actors. June made her screen debut in MGM's version of A Christmas Carol (1938), playing--appropriately enough the daughter of stars Gene Lockhart and Kathleen Lockhart. June appeared in a dozen or more movies before 1947, when she made her Broadway bow playing the ingénue in the comedy \"For Love or Money\" with John Loder. She got a standing ovation on opening night; one critic compared her debut to the first big hits of Helen Hayes and Margaret Sullavan. The overnight toast of Broadway, she went on to win a Tony Award, the Donaldson Award, the Theatre World Award and the Associated Press citation for Woman of the Year for Drama for her work in that play. On television, she has co-starred in popular series like Lassie (1954) and Lost in Space (1965).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Nzk3NzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI3MjY5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001478","name":"June Lockhart","idIMDB":"nm0001478"},"actorId":"nm0001478","character":"Mother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1161064","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1161064","business":{"budget":{"money":"$2,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$21,463","country":"USA","day":"22","month":"03","year":"2009","remarks":"80 Screens"}],"gross":[{"money":"$30,955","country":"USA","day":"19","month":"04","year":"2009","remarks":""},{"money":"$30,881","country":"USA","day":"05","month":"04","year":"2009","remarks":""},{"money":"$30,487","country":"USA","day":"29","month":"03","year":"2009","remarks":""},{"money":"$21,463","country":"USA","day":"22","month":"03","year":"2009","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":[{"money":"$66","country":"USA","day":"19","month":"04","year":"2009","remarks":"1 Screen"},{"money":"$8","country":"USA","day":"05","month":"04","year":"2009","remarks":"1 Screen"},{"money":"$547","country":"USA","day":"29","month":"03","year":"2009","remarks":"11 Screens"},{"money":"$21,463","country":"USA","day":"22","month":"03","year":"2009","remarks":"80 Screens"}],"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"19","month":"02","year":"2008","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"20","month":"03","year":"2008","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 38 min (98 min) (USA)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":["Digital Intermediate"],"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"3.1","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Santa Clarita, California, USA"}],"rated":"PG","awards":[{"award":"Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA 2010","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Saturn Award","categories":[{"category":"Best DVD Release","names":[]}]}]},{"award":"Cairo International Film Festival 2009","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Best Director","categories":[{"category":"Children's International Jury Prize for Long Feature films","names":[{"name":"Ray Griggs","id":"nm2050708","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"937","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0204823","name":"RG Entertainment"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["superhero","time","gold","surrealism","outer space","hero","guard","fictional news show","children","xbox","warp","villainess","van","tattoo","speed","security","saga","robot","reporter","red cape","product placement","police","photographer","mount rushmore","monster","mad magazine","idealism","house","hope","henchman","gun","good versus evil","reference to god","forest","evil smile","devil","court","costume","coke","cigar smoking","christian","chevy","castle","bridge","bank","angel","american hero","80s"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 18:06:39"}}
