Born and raised in Burbank, she studied at the Acting for Life Theatre in Burbank and started off on TV as a teen in the Fame-influenced TV pilot called Best of Times (1981), starring the up-and-coming Nicolas Cage and Crispin Glover. She gained in experience with a number of innocuous films geared mostly toward the young, including D.C. Cab (1983), Thunder Alley (1985) and Hot Moves (1985). The dark-eyed, black-haired pretty girl, with the trademark bangs, wouldn't find her horror niche until hooking up with Wes Craven and his TV movie, Chiller (1985). From there, she scored big with the cult shocker, The Stepfather (1987), wherein she played the resourceful stepdaughter terrorized by the lecherous, meek-appearing Terry O'Quinn as the title monster. The sleeper hit put Jill on the map with a seemingly solid future, continuing on with The Phantom of the Opera (1989), this time keeping company opposite \"Freddy Krueger\" inhabiter, Robert Englund, as her deranged pursuer. But a few bumps in the road, with such low-grade fodder as Curse II: The Bite (1989), Cutting Class (1989) and Popcorn (1991), put a permanent damper on her career, despite coming back with a bit of grit in the thriller TV movie, When a Stranger Calls Back (1993). Her object-of-a-stalker days behind her, after filming Not Again! (1996), she settled comfortably back and raised two children with her husband, musician/composer Anthony Marinelli.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTA0NzA2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcyNTUxNTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0774337","name":"Jill Schoelen","idIMDB":"nm0774337"},"actorId":"nm0774337","character":"Stephanie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shelley Hack","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352379","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyNDk1Mzc5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODc1ODI2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 July 1947","placeOfBirth":" White Plains, New York, USA","birthName":"Shelley Marie Hack","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Shelley was born July 6, 1947 and was a model from age 16.

After catching the attention of a talent scout in Vancouver, he decided to try his hand at acting, spurred on in part by the memory of a less-than-appreciative audience during his first stage performance in junior high. Moving to Los Angeles, he studied with Peggy Feury and soon became a familiar face in feature films including Casual Sex? (1988) with Lea Thompson and Victoria Jackson, festival favourite The Stepfather (1987) with Terry O'Quinn and Shelley Hack, the star-studded miniseries Hollywood Wives (1985), with Anthony Hopkins, Candice Bergen and Robert Stack, and the TV movie and basis of the series Murder One (1995). Returning to Canada in the early 90s, Stephen had a lead role on the Nikita-esque USA Networks series Counterstrike (1990), with Simon MacCorkindale and Christopher Plummer, in which he played Luke Brenner, part of a team of three operatives who fought terrorism around the globe. Back in the U.S., Stephen starred in Stand Off (1994), a film about a hostage crisis for which he won critical raves. He also made an appearance as the cocky actor brother of Craig Sheffer's love interest in the Academy-Award-winning A River Runs Through It (1992); his scenes with Susan Trawley were referred to by Newsweek as the funniest sequence in the movie. His career continued to blend big-budget, box office winners like The Bodyguard (1992) with Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston, and small but critically acclaimed independent films like Rude (1995) which was named the Best Canadian Feature Film at the 1995 Toronto International Film Festival, as well as receiving eight Genie nominations. Stephen can also be seen in guest appearances on popular TV shows like Law & Order (1990) and Tandem de choc (1994). In 1997, he was invited to Toronto to shoot what he thought would be a one-time appearance on _La Femme Nikita_, playing a dedicated police detective who stumbles into more than he bargained for in pursuit of a serial killer. However, he was a hit with the show's fans, and so LFN made the decision to bring him back in a recurring role for the series' fifth and final season. The episodes began airing in the U.S. in January 2001. Stephen has also been seen in the hit Nicolas Cage/Angelina Jolie film Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MzUzMTg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU2MDUxMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0791156","name":"Stephen Shellen","idIMDB":"nm0791156"},"actorId":"nm0791156","character":"Jim Ogilvie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephen E.
