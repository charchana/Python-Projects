Even though she rarely commanded a leading role, she was an effervescent, perpetually wisecracking scene stealer, who invariably had the last word, whether as friend of the heroine, gossipy aunt or nosy parker. Fita began her working life as a dental assistant and telephone operator, while training for acting in her own time. She made her first theatrical appearance in \"Don Carlos\" at Dortmund's Stadttheater in 1925. This was soon followed by comic turns on the larger stages of Berlin and Vienna, after which she was signed by Germany's premier film studio Ufa for a series of short featurettes. Fita was already 34, when she made her breakthrough as a feisty maid in Reinhold Schünzel's off-beat comedy Amphitryon (1935). She established such a popular rapport with the actor Paul Kemp, that she was cast opposite him in further popular outings, including Boccaccio (1936), and, for once co-starring, in The Bashful Casanova (1936). After successive critical plaudits with Love in Stunt Flying (1937), Nuits de Vienne (1939) and Das Fräulein von Barnhelm (1940), Fita had become firmly established as one of Germany's leading comediennes. She continued her career with some success after the war, gradually drifting into character roles, notably as Mother Wolff in Gerhart Hauptmann's The Beaver Coat (1949). After the death of her husband in 1957, she went into quasi-retirement. In the year of her death, 1967, her contribution was deservedly recognised with a Bambi Award.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMDU1NzY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk2MTExMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0071405","name":"Fita Benkhoff","idIMDB":"nm0071405"},"actorId":"nm0071405","character":"Johanna 'Joe' Brinkmann","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Irene von Meyendorff","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0902700","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJjNGFhODktMWExMC00OWI2LThhNTAtZDI0ZWI2MWI1ZmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 June 1916","placeOfBirth":" Reval, Russian Empire [now Tallinn, Estonia]","birthName":"Irene Isabella Margarethe Paulina Caecilia Freiin von Meyendorff","bio":"Born in 1916 as the eldest child of a German-Baltic aristocrat, Baroness Irene Isabella Margarete Pauline Caecila von Meyendorff actually never planned to become a movie star. When the Russian Revolution broke out, the family escaped to Germany, where Irene's mother Elisabeth left her conservative husband with the children to live a very unconventional life in the theatre circles of Weimar/Thuringia. In the early 1930's Irene came to Berlin to work as a cutter in the UFA film studios of Babelsberg. As a breathtaking beautiful, ice-cold blond young woman she would have been the ideal star for Alfred Hitchcock movies. But these were the 1930's and she lived in Nazi Germany. When she was discovered for the screen, her debut was only a mediocre swashbuckler movie - which unexpectedly made her a star. Her best part maybe was the noble Hamburg Patrician daughter Octavia in Veit Harlan's The Great Sacrifice (1944). She never was a sympathizer of the Nazi system. Her first husband, Dr. Heinz Zahler, was a member of the Kreisau Circle, a group of religious motivated anti-Nazi-bourgeois. Her beauty attracted Joseph Goebbels, minister of propaganda, who got a harsh rebuff by her (\"You would degrade me - and you would degrade yourself\"). Joseph Goebbels's infamous nick name \"Bock von Babelsberg\" (the old horny goat of Babelsberg) was Irene's creation. After the war she only played minor parts in German films. In 1961 she met British actor James Robertson Justice, fell in love with him and left her second husband Pit Severin, a journalist from Hamburg, to follow James Robertson Justice to England. It was 1968 when she returned a last time to screen for a small part in the costume drama Mayerling (1968). She never was interested to continue her career. 8 years after James Robertson Justice's death in 1975, she met and later married philanthropist Keith Bromley. Even at the age of 70 she sailed to the Artic and the Orinoco River. On September 28, 2001, she died in Hampshire after a full, remarkable life.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJjNGFhODktMWExMC00OWI2LThhNTAtZDI0ZWI2MWI1ZmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0902700","name":"Irene von Meyendorff","idIMDB":"nm0902700"},"actorId":"nm0902700","character":"Gertrud Pank","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hans Leibelt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500018","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NTI3MTM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQzNzExMzE@._V1_UY44_CR12,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 March 1885","placeOfBirth":" Leipzig, Germany","birthName":"Hans August Hermann Leibelt","bio":"Hans Leibelt was born on March 11, 1885 in Leipzig, Germany as Hans August Hermann Leibelt.

Romanowsky had been variously employed as a locksmith and a wood carver, before becoming a student of the dramatic arts in Vienna and eventually making his stage debut in 1905. A protégé of Max Reinhardt, Romanowsky could count on regular engagements at leading theatres in Berlin and Vienna where he established himself as a firm audience favorite in comical or avuncular roles for more than half a century. His screen career followed a similar pattern. Though he never rose to the same level of stardom as compatriots Hans Moser or Paul Hörbiger, Romanowsky could usually be found among the top four or five on the list of credits. He even had a rare starring role as a shrewd retired accountant in Fremdenheim Filoda (1937). Occasionally, as in The Night with the Emperor (1936), he commanded what amounted to being the male leading role (in this instance opposite Jenny Jugo). Easily the majority of his films in the 30's and 40's were lightweight musical or romantic comedies, enlivened, even occasionally rescued from mediocrity, by Romanowsky's gallery of eccentric professors, theatre directors, befuddled aristocrats or senile old dodderers. His post-war career was severely hampered by eye problems, culminating in temporary blindness in 1954. He retired in 1961 and died seven years later from the effects of an accident suffered at a health resort/spa in Bad Hall in July 1968.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY4MDJlOGItYmNlOC00MjFmLTliMzMtOTg5NzFkNzljMDk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0739061","name":"Richard Romanowsky","idIMDB":"nm0739061"},"actorId":"nm0739061","character":"Theaterdirektor Köllner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Otto Gebühr","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311413","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmZiYjA1MDQtYTY3MS00ZDZhLTg2ODUtMDNiNzc5ZWY5ZTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 May 1877","placeOfBirth":" Kettwig, Essen, Rhine Province, Prussia [now Northrhine-Westphalia], Germany","bio":"Otto Gebühr was born on May 29, 1877 in Kettwig, Essen, Rhine Province, Prussia [now Northrhine-Westphalia], Germany.
