Over 25 years after his untimely death from mesothelioma in 1980, Steve McQueen is still considered hip and cool, and he endures as an icon of popular culture. McQueen was born in Beech Grove, Indiana, to Julia Ann (Crawford) and William Terence McQueen, a stunt pilot. His first lead role was in the low-budget sci-fi film The Blob (1958), quickly followed by roles in The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959) and Never So Few (1959). The young McQueen appeared as Vin, alongside Yul Brynner, in the star-laden The Magnificent Seven (1960) and effectively hijacked the lead from the bigger star by ensuring he was nearly always doing something in every shot he and Brynner were in together, such as adjusting his hat or gun belt. He next scored with audiences with two interesting performances, first in the World War II drama Hell Is for Heroes (1962) and then in The War Lover (1962). Riding a wave of popularity, McQueen delivered another crowd pleaser as Hilts, the Cooler King, in the knockout World War II P.O.W. film The Great Escape (1963), featuring his famous leap over the barbed wire on a motorcycle while being pursued by Nazi troops (in fact, however, the stunt was actually performed by his good friend, stunt rider Bud Ekins). McQueen next appeared in several films of mixed quality, including Soldier in the Rain (1963); Love with the Proper Stranger (1963) and Baby the Rain Must Fall (1965). However, they failed to really grab audience attention, but his role as Eric Stoner in The Cincinnati Kid (1965), alongside screen legend Edward G. Robinson and Karl Malden, had movie fans filling theaters again to see the ice-cool McQueen they loved. He was back in another Western, Nevada Smith (1966), again with Malden, and then he gave what many consider to be his finest dramatic performance as loner US Navy sailor Jake Holman in the superb The Sand Pebbles (1966). McQueen was genuine hot property and next appeared with Faye Dunaway in the provocative crime drama The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), next in what many consider his signature role, that of a maverick, taciturn detective in the mega-hit Bullitt (1968), renowned for its famous chase sequence through San Francisco between McQueen's Ford Mustang and the killer's black Dodge Charger. Interestingly, McQueen's next role was a total departure from the action genre, as he played Southerner Boon Hogganbeck in the family-oriented The Reivers (1969), based on the popular William Faulkner novel. Not surprisingly, the film didn't go over particularly well with audiences, even though it was an entertaining and well made production, and McQueen showed an interesting comedic side of his acting talents. He returned to more familiar territory, with the race film Le Mans (1971), a rather self-indulgent exercise, and its slow plot line contributed to its rather poor performance in theaters. It was not until many years later that it became something of a cult film, primarily because of the footage of Porsche 917s roaring around race tracks in France. McQueen then teamed up with maverick Hollywood director Sam Peckinpah to star in the modern Western Junior Bonner (1972), about a family of rodeo riders, and again with Peckinpah as bank robber Doc McCoy in the violent The Getaway (1972). Both did good business at the box office. McQueen's next role was a refreshing surprise and Papillon (1973), based on the Henri Charrière novel of the same name, was well received by fans and critics alike. He plays a convict on a French penal colony in South America who persists in trying to escape from his captors and feels their wrath when his attempts fail. The 1970s is a decade remembered for a slew of \"disaster\" movies and McQueen starred in arguably the biggest of the time, The Towering Inferno (1974). He shared equal top billing with Paul Newman and an impressive line-up of co-stars including Fred Astaire, Robert Vaughn and Faye Dunaway. McQueen does not appear until roughly halfway into the film as San Francisco fire chief Mike O'Halloran, battling to extinguish an inferno in a 138-story skyscraper. The film was a monster hit and set the benchmark for other disaster movies that followed. However, it was McQueen's last film role for several years. After a four-year hiatus he surprised fans, and was almost unrecognizable under long hair and a beard, as a rabble-rousing early environmentalist in An Enemy of the People (1978), based on the Henrik Ibsen play. McQueen's last two film performances were in the unusual Western Tom Horn (1980), then he portrayed real-life bounty hunter Ralph \"Papa' Thorson (Ralph Thorson) in The Hunter (1980). In 1978, McQueen developed a small but persistent cough that would not go away. He quit smoking and underwent antibiotic treatments without improvement. Shortness of breath grew more pronounced and on December 22, 1979, after he completed work on 'The Hunter', a biopsy revealed pleural mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure for which there is no known cure. The asbestos was thought to have been in the protective suits worn in his race car driving days, but in fact the auto racing suits McQueen wore were made of Nomex, a DuPont fire-resistant aramid fiber that contains no asbestos. McQueen later gave a medical interview in which he believed that asbestos used in movie sound stage insulation and race-drivers' protective suits and helmets could have been involved, but he thought it more likely that his illness was a direct result of massive exposure while removing asbestos lagging from pipes aboard a troop ship while in the US Marines. By February 1980, there was evidence of widespread metastasis. While he tried to keep the condition a secret, the National Enquirer disclosed that he had \"terminal cancer\" on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico for an unconventional treatment after American doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over McQueen's Mexican trip, because McQueen sought a non-traditional cancer treatment called the Gerson Therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cows and sheep, massage and laetrile, a supposedly \"natural\" anti-cancer drug available in Mexico, but not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. McQueen paid for these unconventional medical treatments by himself in cash payments which was said to have cost an upwards of $40,000 per month during his three-month stay in Mexico. McQueen was treated by William Donald Kelley, whose only medical license had been (until revoked in 1976) for orthodontics. McQueen returned to the United States in early October 1980. Despite metastasis of the cancer through McQueen's body, Kelley publicly announced that McQueen would be completely cured and return to normal life. McQueen's condition soon worsened and \"huge\" tumors developed in his abdomen. In late October, McQueen flew to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico to have an abdominal tumor on his liver (weighing around five pounds) removed, despite warnings from his American doctors that the tumor was inoperable and his heart could not withstand the surgery. McQueen checked into a Juarez clinic under the alias \"Sam Shepard\" where the local Mexican doctors and staff at the small, low-income clinic were unaware of his actual identity. Steve McQueen passed away on November 7, 1980, at age 50 after the cancer surgery which was said to be successful. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea. He married three times and had a lifelong love of motor racing, once remarking, \"Racing is life. Anything before or after is just waiting.\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mjk2MTU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA5MTkzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000537","name":"Steve McQueen","nicknames":["Bandito","King Of Cool","Mac","McQ"],"idIMDB":"nm0000537"},"actorId":"nm0000537","character":"Frank Bullitt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0015160","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Vaughn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001816","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MDQxODYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQyNDI2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1932","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Robert Francis Vaughn","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Robert Francis Vaughn was born on November 22, 1932 at Charity Hospital in New York City, the son of show business parents, Marcella Frances (Gaudel) and Gerald Walter Vaughn. His father was a radio actor and his mother starred on stage. Robert came to the public's attention first with his Oscar-nominated role, in The Young Philadelphians (1959). The next year, he was one of the seven in the western classic The Magnificent Seven (1960). Despite being in such popular films, he generally found work on television. He appeared over 200 times in guest roles in the late 1950s to early 1960s. It was in 1963 that he received his first major role in The Lieutenant (1963). Robert took the role with the intention of making the transition from being a guest-star actor to being a co-star on television. It was due to his work in this series that producer Norman Felton offered him the role of Napoleon Solo in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964). Four extremely successful years (1964-68) followed as the series became one of the most popular television series of the 1960s. It made Vaughn an international television star, but he wanted to embark on a career in film, and did so soon after the series ended in 1968 by co-starring in Bullitt (1968) with Steve McQueen. Now working in film full-time, he starred in The Bridge at Remagen (1969) and The Mind of Mr. Soames (1970), before making a change by going back to television, this time in England. He took a lead role in the series The Protectors (1972) and stayed in England for the first half of the 1970s. He returned to the United States in the mid-1970s and embarked on a very successful run of television miniseries roles that resulted in his receiving an Emmy Award in 1978 for Washington: Behind Closed Doors (1977) and a nomination the following year for Backstairs at the White House (1979). The 1970s proved a important time in Robert's life, as in 1974, he married actress Linda Staab, and completed his thesis on Hollywood blacklisting during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" era, published in 1972 as \"Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting\". During the 1980s, he mixed television with film. Roles in such films as S.O.B. (1981), Superman III (1983), The Delta Force (1986) and Black Moon Rising (1986) were highlights. In television, he appeared in many successful series, most notably in The A-Team (1983) and Emerald Point N.A.S. (1983). He continued with a diverse range of projects, appearing on stage on numerous occasions. The 1990s saw the same variety of roles. Made-for-TV movies were a popular choice for him, as well as such series as As the World Turns (1956), The Nanny (1993) and Law & Order (1990). He had a role in the 1998 series remake of the classic film in which he appeared, The Magnificent Seven (1998). He also appeared in major features such as Joe's Apartment (1996) and BASEketball (1998), and in smaller roles in subsequent years. Robert died of acute leukemia on November 11, 2016 in Ridgefield, Connecticut. His last acting credit, Gold Star (2016), was released the year of his death.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MDQxODYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQyNDI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001816","name":"Robert Vaughn","idIMDB":"nm0001816"},"actorId":"nm0001816","character":"Walter Chalmers","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0015162","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacqueline Bisset","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000302","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MjAxMzI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYwNTQ0NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 September 1944","placeOfBirth":" Weybridge, Surrey, England, UK","birthName":"Winnifred Jacqueline Fraser-Bisset","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Jacqueline Bisset has been an international film star since the late 1960s. She received her first roles mainly because of her stunning beauty, but over time she has become a fine actress respected by fans and critics alike. Bisset has worked with directors John Huston, François Truffaut, George Cukor and Roman Polanski. Her co-stars have included Anthony Quinn, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Kenneth Branagh and Marcello Mastroianni. Her somewhat French-sounding name has led many to assume that she is from France, but she was brought up in England and had to study to learn French. Her mother was French and was an attorney before being married. As a child Jacqueline studied ballet. During her teenage years her father left the family when her mother was diagnosed with disseminating sclerosis; Jacqueline worked as a model to support her ailing mother and eventually her parents divorced, an experience she has said she considered character-strengthening. She took an early interest in film, and her modeling career helped pay for acting lessons. In 1967 Bisset gained her first critical attention in Two for the Road (1967), and in that same year appeared briefly in the popular James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967), playing Miss Goodthighs. In 1968 her career got a boost when Mia Farrow unexpectedly dropped out of the shooting of The Detective (1968); Farrow's marriage to co-star Frank Sinatra was on the rocks, and her role was eventually given to Bisset, who received special billing in the film's credits. That same year she earned a Golden Globe nomination as Most Promising Newcomer for her role in The Sweet Ride (1968), and gained even more attention playing opposite Steve McQueen in the popular action film Bullitt (1968). In 1970 she co-starred in the disaster film Airport (1970) as a stewardess carrying Dean Martin's love child, and the film was one of the biggest box office hits of the year. Then she had the starring role in The Grasshopper (1970), and co-starred with Alan Alda in the well-reviewed but commercially underperforming horror film The Mephisto Waltz (1971). In 1973 she became recognized in Europe as a serious dramatic actress when she played the lead in Truffaut's Day for Night (1973). However, it would be several years before her talents would be taken seriously in the US. Jacqueline's stunning looks and figure made quite a splash in The Deep (1977). Her underwater swimming scenes in that movie inspired the worldwide wet T-shirt craze, and Newsweek magazine declared her \"the most beautiful film actress of all time\". The film's producer, Peter Guber, said \"That T-shirt made me a rich man.\" However, she hated the wet T-shirt scenes because she felt exploited. At the time of filming she was not told that the filmmakers would shoot the scenes in such a provocative way, and she felt tricked. Next up came high-profile roles in The Greek Tycoon (1978), a thinly disguised fictionalization of the marriage of Jacqueline Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis, and Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? (1978), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress in a Comedy. In the early 1980s, Bisset starred in the box office disasters Le jour de la fin du monde (1980) and Inchon (1981), but her well-received turn opposite Candice Bergen in Rich and Famous (1981) in between those two films gained her recognition as a serious actress from American audiences. She rebounded neatly with Class (1983), playing Rob Lowe's attractive mother who has an affair with her son's prep school roommate, and as Albert Finney's wife in Au-dessous du volcan (1984), a part that earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She also earned praise for her work in the cable adaptation of Anna Karenina (1985) with Christopher Reeve, and in the miniseries Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story (1987) with Armand Assante. In 1989 she co-starred in the racy comedy Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989) and the controversial erotic thriller Wild Orchid (1989), neither of which did well at the box office, but her output remained consistent with television projects and independent features. In 1996, she was nominated for a César Award, the French equivalent of the Oscar, for her performance in La Cérémonie (1995). She had roles in historical period dramas such as Dangerous Beauty (1998), as a retired courtesan in 16th-century Venice, and the Biblical epics Jésus (1999) and In the Beginning (2000), playing the Virgin Mary and Sarah, wife of Abraham, respectively. Other notable credits included the miniseries Jeanne d'Arc (1999) alongside Leelee Sobieski, which gained her an Emmy nomination, and The Sleepy Time Gal (2001), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival but unfortunately was not picked up for theatrical distribution. In 2005 Jacqueline was back on the big screen playing Keira Knightley's mother in the Domino Harvey biopic Domino (2005) for Tony Scott, and in 2006 she had a meaty recurring role in the fourth season of the FX series Nip/Tuck (2003) as the ruthless extortionist \"James.\" More recently she appeared in BBC's program Dancing on the Edge (2013), for which she finally won her first Golden Globe Award, and in the movies Welcome to New York (2014) with Gérard Depardieu and Miss You Already (2015) with Drew Barrymore and Toni Collette. Bisset has never married, but has been involved in long-term romantic relationships with Canadian actor Michael Sarrazin, Moroccan entrepreneur Victor Drai, Russian ballet dancer Alexander Godunov, French actor Vincent Perez and Turkish martial arts instructor Emin Boztepe. She continues to make numerous films, and frequently participates in film festivals and award ceremonies around the world.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MjAxMzI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYwNTQ0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000302","name":"Jacqueline Bisset","idIMDB":"nm0000302"},"actorId":"nm0000302","character":"Cathy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0015161","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Gordon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330150","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTI2MTY5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI1MDAxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 November 1926","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Donald Walter Guadagno","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Don Gordon was born on November 13, 1926 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Donald Walter Guadagno.

Duvall majored in drama at Principia College (Elsah, IL), then served a two-year hitch in the army after graduating in 1953. He began attending The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre In New York City on the G.I. Bill in 1955, studying under Sanford Meisner along with Dustin Hoffman, with whom Duvall shared an apartment. Both were close to another struggling young actor named Gene Hackman. Meisner cast Duvall in the play \"The Midnight Caller\" by Horton Foote, a link that would prove critical to his career, as it was Foote who recommended Duvall to play the mentally disabled \"Boo Radley\" in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). This was his first \"major\" role since his 1956 motion picture debut as an MP was in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), starring Paul Newman. Duvall began making a name for himself as a stage actor in New York, winning an Obie Award in 1965 playing incest-minded longshoreman \"Eddie Carbone\" in the off-Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge\", a production for which his old roommate Hoffman was assistant director. He found steady work in episodic TV and appeared as a modestly billed character actor in films, such as Arthur Penn's The Chase (1966) with Marlon Brando and in Robert Altman's Countdown (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola's The Rain People (1969), in both of which he co-starred with James Caan. He was also memorable as the heavy who is shot by John Wayne at the climax of True Grit (1969) and was the first \"Maj. Frank Burns\", creating the character in Altman's Korean War comedy MASH (1970). He also appeared as the eponymous lead in George Lucas' directorial debut, THX 1138 (1971). It was Francis Ford Coppola, casting The Godfather (1972), who reunited Duvall with Brando and Caan and provided him with his career breakthrough as mob lawyer \"Tom Hagen\". He received the first of his six Academy Award nominations for the role. Thereafter, Duvall had steady work in featured roles in such films as The Godfather: Part II (1974), The Killer Elite (1975), Network (1976), The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976) and The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Occasionally this actor's actor got the chance to assay a lead role, most notably in Tomorrow (1972), in which he was brilliant as William Faulkner's inarticulate backwoods farmer. He was less impressive as the lead in Badge 373 (1973), in which he played a character based on real-life NYPD detective Eddie Egan, the same man his old friend Gene Hackman had won an Oscar for playing, in fictionalized form as \"Popeye Doyle\" in The French Connection (1971). It was his appearance as \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in another Coppola picture, Apocalypse Now (1979), that solidified Duvall's reputation as a great actor. He got his second Academy Award nomination for the role, and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most versatile actor in the world. Duvall created one of the most memorable characters ever assayed on film, and gave the world the memorable phrase, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\". Subsequently, Duvall proved one of the few established character actors to move from supporting to leading roles, with his Oscar-nominated turns in The Great Santini (1979) and Tender Mercies (1983), the latter of which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Now at the summit of his career, Duvall seemed to be afflicted with the fabled \"Oscar curse\" that had overwhelmed the careers of fellow Academy Award winners Luise Rainer, Rod Steiger and Cliff Robertson. He could not find work equal to his talents, either due to his post-Oscar salary demands or a lack of perception in the industry that he truly was leading man material. He did not appear in The Godfather: Part III (1990), as the studio would not give in to his demands for a salary commensurate with that of Al Pacino, who was receiving $5 million to reprise Michael Corleone. His greatest achievement in his immediate post-Oscar period was his triumphant characterization of grizzled Texas Ranger Gus McCrae in the TV mini-series Lonesome Dove (1989), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He received a second Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in Stalin (1992), and a third Emmy nomination playing Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in The Man Who Captured Eichmann (1996). The shakeout of his career doldrums was that Duvall eventually settled back into his status as one of the premier character actors in the industry, rivaled only by his old friend Gene Hackman. Duvall, unlike Hackman, also has directed pictures, including the documentary We're Not the Jet Set (1977), Angelo My Love (1983) and Assassination Tango (2002). As a writer-director, Duvall gave himself one of his most memorable roles, that of the preacher on the run from the law in The Apostle (1997), a brilliant performance for which he received his third Best Actor nomination and fifth Oscar nomination overall. The film brought Duvall back to the front ranks of great actors, and was followed by a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod for A Civil Action (1998). Robert Duvall will long be remembered as one of the great naturalistic American screen actors in the mode of Spencer Tracy and his frequent co-star Marlon Brando. His performances as \"Boo Radley\" in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), \"Jackson Fentry\" in Tomorrow (1972), \"Tom Hagen\" in the first two \"Godfather\" movies, \"Frank Hackett\" in Network (1976), \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in Apocalypse Now (1979), \"Bull Meechum\" in The Great Santini (1979), \"Mac Sledge\" in Tender Mercies (1983), \"Gus McCrae\" in Lonesome Dove (1989) and \"Sonny Dewey\" in The Apostle (1997) rank as some of the finest acting ever put on film. It's a body of work that few actors can equal, let alone surpass.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk1MjA2Mjc2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE4MTUwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000380","name":"Robert Duvall","nicknames":["Bob"],"idIMDB":"nm0000380"},"actorId":"nm0000380","character":"Weissberg","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Georg Stanford Brown","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0113617","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NjU4ODUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc5ODIyOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 June 1943","placeOfBirth":" Havana, Cuba","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Georg Stanford Brown was born on June 24, 1943 in Havana, Cuba.
