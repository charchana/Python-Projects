Earl Brown does not usually speak of himself in the third-person. However, the Internet Movie Database will not accept biographical information written in the first person, therefore: W Earl Brown was born and raised in western Kentucky. Realizing early in life that he had aversion to manual labor, he knew that farming life was not for him. The first theater he ever attended was on his grandparents' front porch, where, in following family tradition, they would entertain themselves after a day's work with songs and stories. He was much better suited to that part of Kentucky farm life rather than the fields and barns. In high school, Earl was actively involved, and quite successful, in forensic competition where his coach fired a competitive spirit and taught his students the value of hard work and sacrifice. It was during those years, Earl's love of movies blossomed and he first had the dream of working in films; however, at the point in his life such an idea seemed impossible to achieve. The first in his family to go to college, Earl took an acting class on a whim at Murray State University and it was in that class that he found his Calling. He began performing in numerous productions on campus. It was in a production of \"That Championship Season\" in 1983 that he first had the experience of craft being elevated to art, and due to that, he was hooked. Earl received his MFA from DePaul University's Theatre School in 1989. After graduation, he performed in numerous plays around Chicago. His first job on a film set was teaching dialect on Backdraft (1991). Not long after that, his performance in \"A View From the Bridge\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre catapulted his career as an actor into television and film. He landed numerous roles and within a couple of years had hit the proverbial glass ceiling. In 1993, he relocated to Los Angeles and started over. Wes Craven was an early supporter of Earl's; he cast him in New Nightmare (1994), A Vampire in Brooklyn (1995) and the role of \"Kenny\" in the classic, Scream (1996). Two years after the success of Scream, Earl played \"Warren\", Cameron Diaz's mentally challenged brother, in There's Something About Mary (1998). Among his many other film credits are the highly regarded films: Being John Malkovich (1999), The Master (2012), The Sessions (2012), Wild (2014), and Black Mass (2015) On television, Earl has guest starred in many series, including: Luck (2011), Seinfeld (1995), American Horror Story (2011), Justified (2009), X-Files (2002), Six Feet Under (2001), and NYPD Blue (2000 & 2005). Among the TV movies he has been involved with, was the starring role in VH1's Meatloaf: To Hell and Back (2000). He played \"Tom Carlin\" in ABC's highly acclaimed anthology series American Crime (2015) and \"Teague Dixon\" in HBO's True Detective (2015). He is probably best known as \"Dan Dority\" in HBO's Deadwood (2003). During that series' second season, the show's creator, David Milch, invited him to join the writing staff. In 2007, Earl earned a WGA nomination for writing on a drama series and a SAG nomination for best drama ensemble acting. Establishing himself on a show as critically lauded as Deadwood opened doors for other writing projects, including the Sony release, Bloodworth (2011), which Earl wrote and produced. In addition to his television and film work, Earl co-starred in Sony's The Last Of Us, 2013 Video Game Of The Year. He also writes music and records with Sacred Cowboys, an LA based Americana band. One other thing of note, because W. Earl Brown gets asked it often and it seems as hoity-toity as speaking of himself in the third person: The \"W\" was added to his name upon joining the Screen Actors Guild. The guild has a rule that two actors can not have the same name, he was told that there was an \"Earl Brown\" and a \"William Brown\", hence he became W. Earl Brown (a name he remembered from the label of an Elvis Presley record)... Then when his recording work in Sacred Cowboys necessitated his joining the songwriter's rights association, ASCAP, (where songwriter W. Earl Brown was represented) he had to become \"William Earl Brown.\" It's confusing - he knows.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NTUzMjM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY2Mjk1NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0114868","name":"W.

AMC occur once in every 3,000 births. Doctors said she would never have use of her limbs. From birth through age 8, she went through several major surgeries to improve her mobility. She had already proven the doctors wrong by learning to write, stand to transfer and swim. Jennifer's inabilities have never stopped her from breaking barriers, overcoming adversity and living her life to the fullest. She is the oldest of six children and was raised in a family that saw her differences as something that made her unique. Being a child with a disability outside of her home wasn't as easy. There were many prejudgments Jennifer faced growing up. Jennifer discovered her passion for music and theater by the time she was in kindergarten. She began singing in the church choir at Holy Innocence Catholic Church in Long Beach at age 6. After realizing that singing was something she enjoyed, she joined local theater groups and school choir and even played drums in the orchestra. Being a professional singer and performer was a secret dream of Jennifer's. She didn't think that society would accept a performer in a wheelchair. When it came time for Jennifer to go to college she decided to pursue music education. This still allowed her to study voice as she did at Riverside Community College. In 2000 Jennifer moved and continued her education at Long Beach City College and voice lessons at CSULB. After two years of doing something she wasn't passionate about, Jennifer decided to branch out into the performing world and audition. Her first audition was for Warner Bros. Reality TV Show \"PopStars2\". Jennifer made the first two episodes and created a buzz as \"the girl in the wheelchair\" in TV Guide, Variety Magazine and other local papers. Jennifer's confidence and will to live her dream grew and she began taking more time to audition. In 2002, after an extensive audition process, Jennifer was cast by internationally recognized director of opera and theater, Francesca Zambello, in Disney's \"Aladdin; A Musical Spectacular\", making her the first performer in a wheelchair in a Disney Theme Park. Jennifer represents the disabled community to 8,000 people a day. She is proud to bring inclusion of the disabled community in an able bodied world. She continues to perform and had done so in venues such as the Stella Adler Theater, the Staples Center and the Kodak Theater. As the First Runner Up for Ms. Wheelchair California 2009, Jennifer was blessed with numerous opportunities to educate California on its vast disabled community sharing with them \"just how able we are\". She has even had the opportunity to do fun and awesome things. She helped Habitat for Humanity of Los Angeles build a home in Downey, surfed with Life Roll On, and has spoken to the East Fresno Kiwanis Club, Disney's CastAble Group, Boeing and parents of children with Arthrogryposis. Jennifer is involved with the Special Olympics in Long Beach as a performer and in Orange County as Stage Manager for the fall Opening Ceremonies 2009. Jennifer was crowned Ms. Wheelchair California 2010 at the Abilities Expo in Los Angeles, California. \"It is an honor and a privilege to represent the disabled community of California.\" She represented California at the Ms. Wheelchair America Pageant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Jennifer came back the 1st Runner Up to Ms. Wheelchair America and the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award. Since receiving her title last April, Jennifer has spent time with numerous Kiwanis groups in California, served as the keynote speaker for the 5th Annual Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita Convention as well as Disney World Entertainment Company, both in Orlando, Florida, attended & sang at the 20th Anniversary Celebration of the ADA in San Jose and Sacramento. She also received the \"Jerry Stein Independent Living Award\" this year through the Disabled Resource Center in Long Beach, California. One of her fondest memories was riding the Kiwanis International float, \"Childrens' Dreams\" in the Tournament of Roses Parade New Years Day 2011. Her biggest achievement has been creating the \"Little Miss Wheelchair California Pageant\". Aside from being the Little Miss Wheelchair California Pageant Coordinator, Ms. Kumiyama is the Chief Editor of Disabled Guides at www.notanotherguide.com, an online travel guide.
