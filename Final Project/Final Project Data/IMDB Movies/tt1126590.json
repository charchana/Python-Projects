She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry. Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as \"Brigadoon\" and \"A Chorus Line\". It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work. Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Belles à mourir (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Cruel Intentions (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"Kathryn Merteuil\". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, Dr. Vegas (2004). Her role in the low-budget independent film Junebug (2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of \"Giselle\" in the animated/live-action feature film, Enchanted (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Adams next appeared in the major production, Charlie Wilson's War (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Sunshine Cleaning (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as \"Sister James\" in Doubt (2008) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as Amelia Earhart in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in Julie & Julia (2009). In the early 2010s, she starred with Jason Segel in The Muppets (2011), with Philip Seymour Hoffman in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012), and alongside Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in Trouble with the Curve (2012). She played reporter Lois Lane in Man of Steel (2013) and con artist Sydney Prosser in American Hustle (2013), before portraying real-life artist Margaret Keane in Tim Burton's biopic Big Eyes (2014). In 2016, she reprised her role as Lane in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and headlined Denis Villeneuve's science fiction drama Arrival (2016) and Tom Ford's dark thriller Nocturnal Animals (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjExMjI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc0MjY2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010736","name":"Amy Adams","idIMDB":"nm0010736"},"actorId":"nm0010736","character":"Margaret Keane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0122672","main":true},{"actorName":"Christoph Waltz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910607","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MDk3OTYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk5OTUwOQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 October 1956","placeOfBirth":" Vienna, Austria","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Christoph Waltz is an Austrian-German actor. He is known for his works with American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, receiving acclaim for portraying SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) and bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Django Unchained (2012). For each performance, he won an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Additionally, he received the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his portrayal of Landa. Christoph Waltz was born in Vienna, Austria, to Elisabeth Urbancic, an Austrian-born costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a German-born stage builder. He has three siblings. He was born into a theater family, as his maternal grandmother was Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. His maternal grandfather, Rudolf von Urban, was a psychologist and psychiatrist who wrote the 1949 book \"Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness\". Waltz attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London. During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however, attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner. It was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds (2009) catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar and Academy Award-winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he won again for 2012's Django Unchained (2012)). He also portrayed computer genius Qohen Leth in the film The Zero Theorem (2013), American plagiarist Walter Keane in the biographical film _Big Eyes (2014), and 007's nemesis and head of SPECTRE Ernst Stavro Blofeld in _Spectre (2015)_. In Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayed SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa, aka \"The Jew Hunter\". Clever, courteous, and multilingual - but also self-serving, cunning, implacable, and murderous. Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky in The Green Hornet (2011). That same year, he starred in Water for Elephants (2011), Roman Polanski's Carnage (2011), and a remake of Les Trois Mousquetaires (2011). He played German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz. Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His wife is costume builder Judith Holste.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MDk3OTYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk5OTUwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910607","name":"Christoph Waltz","idIMDB":"nm0910607"},"actorId":"nm0910607","character":"Walter Keane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0290003","main":true},{"actorName":"Danny Huston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396812","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MTk4NDA0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ5NzIzNTk@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 May 1962","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Danny Huston is an American actor and director who has worked with Academy award-nominated actors from the very start of his career. No surprise for a man who was born into a legendary Hollywood family whose most noted members included his half-sister, his father, his grandfather, his nephew, and of course, himself. Born in Rome, Huston's parents were Zoe Sallis and John Huston. Sallis was an established author in her own right. John Huston was, by that point, famous for his many high caliber films, and notorious for his personal life, which included five marriages, two children, another adopted child, and many affairs, one of which resulted in Danny's conception. Like his half-sister, Anjelica Huston, Danny Huston chose to follow his father into the world of film. His birthright served as a blessing, so that his first film appearance as an actor was in The 'Human' Factor (1975), a revenge film directed by and starring men who already had Oscar nominations under their belts. Following that small appearance, Huston turned to directing for the next few years. It wasn't until the late 1980s that Huston directed his first made-for-television film, Mister Corbett's Ghost (1987). Based on a novella by Leon Garfied, the film starred such screen legends as Paul Scofield and Burgess Meredith. It is also notable for being the final acting project of Huston's father John, who spent his final years assisting his children in their own budding film careers. Shortly before his death, John helped produce his son's first feature length film, Mr. North (1988). The film was directed by Huston, and included his half-sister Anjelica in the cast, as well as Virginia Madsen, whom Huston would marry for a few years. Huston followed this up with the sexual drama Becoming Colette (1991), starring Klaus Maria Brandauer, and the horror film The Maddening (1995), starring Burt Reynolds. Neither film made a huge impact, and it was around this time, twenty years after his last acting role, that Huston returned to appearing in front of the camera. Starting modestly as a barman in the highly acclaimed Leaving Las Vegas (1995), Huston followed up with a supporting role in Anna Karenina (1997), alongside such would-be thespians as Sean Bean, Sophie Marceau, and Alfred Molina. The film was unfortunately a flop, as were Huston's next few film roles. In 2000, however, the tide finally turned, and Huston was able to break out as an established character actor. Re-uniting with his Anna Karenina director, Bernard Rose, Huston starred in the small-budget film Ivansxtc (2000), which was an adaptation of a book by Leo Tolstoy. While not a financial triumph, the film received very positive reactions from critics. The same fate awaited the film Hotel (2001), which included Huston in a diverse cast which included Lucy Liu, Rhys Ifans, Salma Hayek, and John Malkovich. It was also around this time that Huston met and married his second wife, Katie Jane Evans, though this marriage would end in great tragedy several years later. For now, though, Huston's career as an actor was just getting started. It was 21 Grams (2003) which secured Huston his first bona fide financial and critical success. Starring such names as Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro, the film follows a non-linear storyline dealing with the lives of several people who are affected by an automobile accident. Huston followed up this success by appearing in John Sayle's Silver City (2004), the controversial feature film Birth (2004), and Martin Scorsese's wildly successful film about Howard Hughes known as Aviator (2004). Nominated for many awards, the film was also a success financially. But nothing Huston had done up to this point would equal to what he did next. John Hillcoat's Australian western The Proposition (2005) is a very dark film set mostly in a small community in the Australian Outback during the 19th century. A criminal is dispatched by the local law enforcement to hunt down his older brother, Arthur Burns, and kill him. As played by Huston, Burns is a psychopath who cares nothing for the various rapes and murders that he has committed. He does, however, find some chasm of his heart to enjoy music, poetry, and the glorious beauty of the Australian sunsets. This layered performance as the film's villain arguably ranks as Huston's greatest performance to date. That same year, Huston played in the highly acclaimed film The Constant Gardener (2005), which tackled corruption, love, and humanitarian efforts by the West in Africa. Huston moved from Oscar-winning film to Oscar-winning film the following year with the films Marie Antoinette (2006) and Children of Men (2006). In the former, Huston portrays the Holy Roman Emperor, Joseph II, as a cautious and thoughtful monarch who warns Marie Antoinette of her excessive lifestyle. He proves to be prophetic when the French mobs storm the Bastille and launch a revolution. In the latter film, set in a dystopian world of global human infertility, Huston portrays Nigel, a government official who uses his position to preserve famous artwork. Both films were highly successful, and further cemented Huston as a noted actor. Huston proceeded to play Orson Welles in the thriller Fade to Black (2006), and also acted in the financially successful war film The Kingdom (2007) and the poorly received The Number 23 (2007). From this point onward, Huston would appear in many films, portraying characters of various importance. Among the more noted examples would be the superhero film X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), where Huston played the villainous role of William Stryker, the man who imprisons Wolverine and is responsible for his experimentation with adamantium. Huston also portrayed the Greek god Poseidon in Clash of the Titans (2010), as well as its sequel two years later. Whether the crime film Edge of Darkness (2010), the historical epic Robin Hood (2010), the biographical Hitchcock (2012), or the comedy 2 Jacks (2012) (which was another adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's work, again directed by Bernard Rose and also starred Huston's nephew Jack Huston ), Huston has constantly showed his range of accents, characters, and genres. More recently, Huston has continued to appear in films, including the upcoming Tim Burton -directed biopic Big Eyes (2014) and \"Frankenstein\", which will once again reunite him with Bernard Rose. Huston has also moved into the world of television with such series as \"Magic City\" (which earned him a Golden Globe nomination), \"American Horror Story\", and \"Masters of Sex\". As busy and talented as he always has been through nearly four decades of work in the film industry, Danny Huston continues to work as one of Hollywood's veteran character actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MTk4NDA0NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ5NzIzNTk@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396812","name":"Danny Huston","idIMDB":"nm0396812"},"actorId":"nm0396812","character":"Dick Nolan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0496744","main":true},{"actorName":"Krysten Ritter","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1269983","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODgwMzUxODQ4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY1NTgxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 December 1981","placeOfBirth":" Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Krysten Alyce Ritter","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Krysten Ritter stars as Jessica Jones in the Peabody, Hugo, and Emmy Award winning Netflix original series, \"Marvel's Jessica Jones.\" Her performance, which earned her a prestigious Critics Choice nomination, a Saturn nomination, a Webby Award and a Glamour Best International TV Actress Award, has received rave reviews with the show being celebrated by critics and audiences alike for it's groundbreaking depiction of a reluctant anti-super-heroine with an alcohol problem and a wicked case of PTSD: who will not let a sexual assault from her past define her.

At the time she could only read French, so she had to rely on her fellow budding thespians to translate the script for her. After catching the \"acting bug\", she then went on to appear in many commercials, music videos and theatre productions. It was almost a decade later when Madeleine landed her first substantial role as a guest star in the HUB's R.L.Stine's The Haunting Hour. And it was then, at age fifteen, that Madeleine decided to seriously follow her passion and give acting a go. Her hard work paid off, and in 2013, Madeleine booked several roles. These included a guest star role in the Hub's Spooksville, a role on Fox /AMC's The Killing, and a role in Sony's Grace: The Possession, directed by Jeff Chan. Little wonder that Madeleine, with her big beautiful blue eyes and matching talent, was then chosen to play the teenage version of artist Margaret Keane's (Amy Adams) daughter 'Jane' in Tim Burton's upcoming feature, Big Eyes. Margaret Keane's inspiration for her paintings of big-eyed waifs was her daughter, who was also instrumental in helping her leave her oppressive marriage with Walter (Christoph Waltz), and to gain the credit that she deserved for her art. At only seven-teen years of age, and with a career that has pretty much blossomed in only one year, the opportunity to work with an Oscar nominee, a two-time Oscar winner, and to be directed by the legendary Tim Burton, has been a life changing experience for Madeleine. After this amazing opportunity, Madeleine then landed the recurring role of 'Charlotte' in CW's The Tomorrow People for which she won 'Best Young Actress in a Supporting/Recurring Role in a Dramatic Series' at the recent 2014 Joey Awards. She was also nominated for a Joey Award for \"Young Actress in a Guest Starring Role in a Drama or Comedy Series\", for her work in Spooksville. This year, Madeleine, along with her role on The Tomorrow People, did a supporting role in the TV movie The Reluctant Witness, and has just wrapped up 2014 in a suitably impressive fashion with a guest-starring role in an episode of Warner Bros/CW's huge hit, Supernatural, now in it's 10th season.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjU5MzY4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM0NTI4NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4699715","name":"Madeleine Arthur","idIMDB":"nm4699715"},"actorId":"nm4699715","character":"Older Jane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0475884","main":true},{"actorName":"James Saito","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756839","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MTQ3MTMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcwNDk3MDE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 March 1955","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"James Tomio Saito","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"James Saito was born on March 6, 1955 in Los Angeles, California, USA as James Tomio Saito.
