To add to his problems, Topper misses his dad, who is off sailing the seven seas or who knows - perhaps even further away than that. But one day, Topper finds something amazing, and suddenly life isn't quite so boring after all. He finds a pencil - not an ordinary pencil, mind - that wouldn't be special at all. No, this one can do magic! Together with his best friend, Viggo, Topper is about to discover all the incredible things this kind of pencil can be used for. Topper and Viggo live in the same old, red brick building. The ground floor is occupied by the Red Catfish Café owned by Viggo's dad, Mr Lion. Topper lives on the second floor - and it is here that he and Viggo draw a rhino on the wall - a yellow rhino with three horns. They don't have to wait long for something magical to happen. Moments later the rhino comes alive!","simplePlot":"Topper is an optimistic young boy with a vivid imagination. He is also in love with Cilla, but she thinks he's very crazy. One day Topper finds a pencil and draws a rhino that comes to live! This changes everything.","actors":[{"actorName":"Nikolai Aamand","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5431420","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nikolai Aamand is an actor, known for Otto the Rhino (2013), Børnenes Verden (2013) and Mops & Ollie (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5431420","name":"Nikolai Aamand","idIMDB":"nm5431420"},"actorId":"nm5431420","character":"Viggo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Noah Crone Back","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5430195","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Noah Crone Back is an actor, known for Otto the Rhino (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5430195","name":"Noah Crone Back","idIMDB":"nm5430195"},"actorId":"nm5430195","character":"Jakob","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lars Brygmann","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0117368","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY0MDY2MDEyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTczOTk5OA@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1957","placeOfBirth":" Copenhagen, Denmark","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Lars Brygmann was born on February 17, 1957 in Copenhagen, Denmark.
