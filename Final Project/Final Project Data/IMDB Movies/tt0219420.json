His main success has been as one-half of the shapeshifting musical duo My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. Marston Daley formed My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult with pal Frank Nardiello in 1987. Originally conceived as an exploitation-style art film project, the making of the film became secondary to the creation of its soundtrack. Taking the film's title for the name of their band, they dubbed themselves Buzz McCoy and Groovie Mann and released their first self-titled 3-track EP on Wax Trax Records. Alongside labelmates Ministry and Front 242, Thrill Kill Kult played a very important part in the creation of a sound that would eventually become known as \"industrial\", a genre that was eventually taken into the mainstream by acts such as Nine Inch Nails. It was also Thrill Kill Kult who made it cool to snag lines of dialogue from films and other various sources and work them into the music, and some of their most popular tracks consisted mostly of a collage of samples from cult films. Unlike their peers, Thrill Kill Kult's sound often changed dramatically, based in both electronic club music and rock 'n' roll aesthetics. Their image and lyrical themes made allusions to sex, drugs, and Satan, but were also firmly based in b-movie territory. Drawing from everything from horror movies and sleazy drive-in exploitation to the films of Russ Meyer and Jesus Franco, their music went hand in hand with their interest in kitschy films and pop culture references. When their third album for Wax Trax, \"Sexplosion!\", became the label's biggest-selling album to date, the band signed with Interscope Records and released three albums for the label. My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult began appearing on a number of movie soundtracks, starting with \"Cool World\" in 1992. They made a cameo appearance in the film \"The Crow\" as themselves, and contributed two songs to the big-budget b-movie \"Showgirls\", which ironically continues on as a major cult item. Filmmakers such as Paul Verhoven and Greg Araki have acknowledged their interest in the band, and have made a habit of putting MLWTTKK's music in their films. Although My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult parted ways with Interscope a number of years ago, they still continue to record and perform live across the United States. A prolific talent who is usually always working, Marston Daley also has made a number of appearances in other bands, including a side project called Excessive Force that he formed with Sascha from KMFDM. More recently he produced a project called Cherrie Blue, together with former Lords Of Acid vocalist Ruth McArdle (aka Lady Galore), and a long-rumored Thrill Kill Kult side project called Gay Black & Married is supposed to see the light of day sometime soon.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0197866","name":"Marston Daley","idIMDB":"nm0197866"},"actorId":"nm0197866","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marc Freeman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5652046","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Marc Freeman yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5652046","name":"Marc Freeman","idIMDB":"nm5652046"},"actorId":"nm5652046","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Curt Gebhart","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1456516","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Curt Gebhart is an actor, known for Maze (1997), Patlabor: The Mobile Police (1989) and Patlabor: Early Days (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1456516","name":"Curt Gebhart","idIMDB":"nm1456516"},"actorId":"nm1456516","character":"News Reporter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rebecca Harns","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5652109","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Rebecca Harns yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5652109","name":"Rebecca Harns","idIMDB":"nm5652109"},"actorId":"nm5652109","character":"News Reporter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Babette LeBitch","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5652586","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Babette LeBitch yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5652586","name":"Babette LeBitch","idIMDB":"nm5652586"},"actorId":"nm5652586","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0219420","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219420","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 15 min (75 min) (USA)"],"soundMix":["Stereo"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"5.5","filmingLocations":[],"rated":"UNRATED","awards":[],"votes":"72","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[],"keywords":{"keywords":["businessman","vehicular homicide","internal affairs","corrupt cop","gun","police","organized crime","tokyo japan","s&m","tied to a post","hit and run","bondage","violence","shooting","nude with a gun","female nudity","female killer","female frontal nudity","female assassin","death","based on comic"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:06:45"}}
