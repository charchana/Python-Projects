Discovered by a casting director while he was waiting in front of a high school in Paris, he was offered a role. Between popular successes such as \"Good old daze\", \"Dobermann\", \"Tom thumb\", \"The Spanish apartment\" or \"Arsene Lupin\", and independent films like \"17 times Cecile Cassard\", \"Exiles\", \"Gadjo Dilo\", \"Being light\", \"Already dead\" or \"When the cat's away\", Duris proves to be versatile enough to be credible as a bandit, as a homosexual, or simply as a French student in the streets of Barcelona. The consecration has been \"De Battre Mon Coeur S'Est Arrete\"; now Duris is seen as an excellent and touching actor by the critics and by the audience.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NjUwNDA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1NzU1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244151","name":"Romain Duris","idIMDB":"nm0244151"},"actorId":"nm0244151","character":"Daniel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlotte Gainsbourg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001250","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQyMzQ5NTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI3NTEzNQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 July 1971","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Charlotte Lucy Gainsbourg","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Charlotte Gainsbourg was born in London, England in 1971.
