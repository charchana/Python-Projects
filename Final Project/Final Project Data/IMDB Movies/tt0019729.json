She was best known for starring in The Broadway Melody (1929), the first sound film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Her leading men included the likes of John Gilbert, Clark Gable, Buster Keaton and Robert Montgomery. Only in her late teens when stardom beckoned, Anita had a huge following that earned her record amounts of fan mail, but she was seldom given lead roles, most often playing second lead, perhaps due to her youthful inexperience as an actress. She was a charming, much-loved screen personality but by 1932 MGM seemed to lose interest in her career despite impressive work in such films as Night Court (1932) and Skyscraper Souls (1932), and before the year was out her contract was not renewed; she slipped off into \"B\" stardom in films at Columbia, Universal and even more minor studios. She retired from the screen in 1936, making a return 25 years later in The Runaway (1961) with Cesar Romero, and she lived quietly out of the limelight for over a half century. In the 1990s the now widowed star was rediscovered by the media, which enjoyed her light-humored journeys down memory lane about her career, MGM, the silent and early talkie eras and the stars she knew, earning the actress a devoted cult of young fans and a few brief appearances in ultra-low-budget films of the 1990s.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDIxODc1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjAyMjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0656105","name":"Anita Page","nicknames":["The Girl With the Most Beautiful Face in Hollywood"],"idIMDB":"nm0656105"},"actorId":"nm0656105","character":"Queenie Mahoney","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0162589","main":true},{"actorName":"Bessie Love","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0522281","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzIwMjU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI0OTg0MzE@._V1._CR143,185,706,934_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 September 1898","placeOfBirth":" Midland, Texas, USA","birthName":"Juanita Horton","height":"5' (1.52 m)","bio":"Bessie Love was born in Texas. Her cowboy father moved the family to Hollywood, where he became a chiropractor. As the family needed money, Bessie's mother sent her to Biograph Studios, hoping she would become an actress. D.W. Griffith saw she was pretty and had some acting talent, and put her in several of his films, also giving her a small part in Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages (1916). Bessie became popular with audiences and worked with Douglas Fairbanks in Reggie Mixes In (1916) and William S. Hart in The Aryan (1916). She then moved to Vitagraph and starred in a number of comedy-dramas. In the 1920s she began to act in more mature roles, such as Those Who Dance (1924), and also began working on the stage. She performed the first screen \"Charleston\" dance in The King on Main Street (1925), and gave one of her best performances in Dress Parade (1927). When sound movies came into vogue, she made a number of them and received an Academy Award nomination for The Broadway Melody (1929). By 1931, however, her career was over. She moved to England in 1935 and entertained the troops during World War II. By the 1950s she started playing small roles in movies such as No Highway in the Sky (1951). She played in a handful of low-budget films from the 1950s through the 1970s. In the 1980s she appeared in the big-budget Ragtime (1981) which starred James Cagney, and later that year in Reds (1981) which starred Warren Beatty.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzIwMjU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI0OTg0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0522281","name":"Bessie Love","idIMDB":"nm0522281"},"actorId":"nm0522281","character":"Hank Mahoney","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0162590","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0019729","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019729","business":{"budget":{"money":"$379,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"$1,558,000 (Worldwide)","country":"except","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 40 min (100 min) (TCM print)"],"soundMix":["Mono (Western Electric Sound System)","Silent"],"color":["Black and White","Color (2-Strip Technicolor) (one sequence)"],"aspectRatio":["1.37 : 1 (sound on disc version)","1.20 : 1 (sound on film version)"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["1,811.45 m (6 reels) (silent version) (USA)","2,856.6 m (10 reels) (sound version) (USA)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.3","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios - 10202 W.
