She was born on August 5, 1950 in Montreal (Québec) Canada. The profession she has chosen did not give her any satisfaction. She met some young Canadian film makers, that resulted in her first appearance as an actress, age twenty, in Mon enfance à Montréal (1971), directed by Jean Chabot. Three years later, she met director Gilles Carle, who helped her career. Her exotic beauty (her mother has Indian blood), her charm and spontaneity, her dark eyes with light melancholy look, made her a star in French-Canadian cinema. She is not only acting but also sings. Carole has recorded several LPs in French and English, collaborating with Lewis Furey. She also sings in the filmmusical Fantastica (1980) directed by her old friend, Gilles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjQzNDI1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE2MDI5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491021","name":"Carole Laure","idIMDB":"nm0491021"},"actorId":"nm0491021","character":"Judy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nick Mancuso","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541576","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NjUwOTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMxOTQzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 May 1948","placeOfBirth":" Mammola, Calabria, Italy","birthName":"Nicodemo Antonio Massimo Mancuso","bio":"Darkly handsome Nick Mancuso, born Nicodemo Antonio Massimo Mancuso, was born in 1948 in Mammola, Italy but raised as a child in Canada (from age 8). During his over four decade career, films claimed him as the Antichrist (Franco Macalousso) in the Apocalypse trilogy produced by Cloud Ten Pictures (Revelation (1999), Tribulation (2000) and Judgment (2001)), and TV has him best known for his starring roles in the NBC action series Stingray (1985), which ran for two seasons, and as the title hitman who becomes a target himself in the one-season Matrix (1993). Although he developed an interest in acting in high school, he chose to study psychology at the University of Toronto. The acting bug bit again, however, and he was soon drawn to various Canadian theatre groups in the 1970s. During this time, he became artistic director for the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre, at the same time building up his classical resume at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. TV and film soon came his way in the late 1970s, and he tackled roles both in Hollywood, first as TV's Dr. Scorpion (1978), and back in his homeland, where he won the prestigious Genie award for the movie Ticket to Heaven (1981) as a man caught up in a religious cult. He impressed moviegoers as well with his moody, sexy presence in the US film Heartbreakers (1984) co-starring Peter Coyote and has also provided solid support for other stars, notably for Steven Seagal in one of that star's best action thrillers Piège en haute mer (1992). A sturdy name as an anti-hero or heavy in modestly-budgeted independents, Nick has proven over the years to be a solid, durable player in the \"tough guy\" crime mold, almost always with a serious edge. More recent, post-millennium gritty films include Time of Fear (2002) Today You Die (2005), starring his \"Under Siege\" cohort Steven Seagal, Contract Killers (2008), Violent Blue (2011), Entity (2013) and The Big Fat Stone (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NjUwOTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMxOTQzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0541576","name":"Nick Mancuso","idIMDB":"nm0541576"},"actorId":"nm0541576","character":"Michael","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Stéphane Audran","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000804","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc5Njc5MjY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkyNDcyNA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 November 1932","placeOfBirth":" Versailles, Seine-et-Oise [now Yvelines], France","birthName":"Colette Suzanne Dacheville","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Stéphane Audran was born on November 8, 1932 in Versailles, Seine-et-Oise [now Yvelines], France as Colette Suzanne Dacheville.

Raised and educated in Ottawa, the national capital, she graduated from the University of Ottawa with a B.A. (concentration in Theatre and Philosophy). The initial plan was for Law School, but despite offers of admission, including scholarships, she followed her heart to be a performer instead. Though trained mainly as an actor, Barbara's professional career began with a dance role in New York City in \"Follies de Paris\", a Vegas style review. It was dancing that led to her film debut in \"Night Magic\", a fantasy musical shot in Montreal, Quebec. This first movie role also meant a return to acting, and led to a thriving film and television career of 25 years (to date). A recipient of several regional Canadian awards for acting, and a Gemini nomination for Best Actress In A Continuing Leading Dramatic Role (as Wanda Gibbs in \"Side Effects\"), she chose to expand her horizons and relocated to Los Angeles in 1998. Barbara's many starring roles span the range from tough U.S. Army Ranger Drill Instructor, Sgt. Rhodes (\"Dead Men Can't Dance\"), to grief stricken widow and mother, Janice Crosby, opposite Louis Gossett Jr. (\"In His Father's Shoes\"). The list of her credits now comprises 9 theatrical features; 20 television features; and over 100 episodic T.V. appearances including the role of FBI Agent Felicia Lang in the final 3 seasons of the hit series, \"Prison Break.\" One of Barbara's favorite perquisites of being an actor is the opportunity to travel. Aside from numerous locations within North America, she has enjoyed filming in the Philippines (\"Dead Men Can't Dance\"), New Zealand (\"The Nightmare Man\"), Hawaii (\"E.R.\"), and Bogota, Colombia, (\"Mental\"). Her fantasy gig? A dance/action/drama shot on location throughout Europe.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzg3OTE3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUwMzQ0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364458","name":"Barbara Eve Harris","idIMDB":"nm0364458"},"actorId":"nm0364458","character":"Doubt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kathryn Greenaway","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338439","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kathryn Greenaway is an actress, known for Night Magic (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0338439","name":"Kathryn Greenaway","idIMDB":"nm0338439"},"actorId":"nm0338439","character":"Pinky","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michelle Stennett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0826635","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Michelle Stennett is an actress, known for Night Magic (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0826635","name":"Michelle Stennett","idIMDB":"nm0826635"},"actorId":"nm0826635","character":"Michelle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Frank Augustyn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041979","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Frank Augustyn is an actor, known for The Tin Soldier (1992), Adolphe Adam Giselle (1976) and Night Magic (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041979","name":"Frank Augustyn","idIMDB":"nm0041979"},"actorId":"nm0041979","character":"Frank","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Louis Robitaille","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0733249","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Louis Robitaille is an actor, known for Night Magic (1985) and Champs-Elysées (1982).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0733249","name":"Louis Robitaille","idIMDB":"nm0733249"},"actorId":"nm0733249","character":"Louis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-Marc Lebeau","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0495491","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jean-Marc Lebeau is an actor, known for Night Magic (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0495491","name":"Jean-Marc Lebeau","idIMDB":"nm0495491"},"actorId":"nm0495491","character":"Jean-Marc","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-Hugues Rochette","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734076","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jean-Hugues Rochette is an actor, known for Night Magic (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734076","name":"Jean-Hugues Rochette","idIMDB":"nm0734076"},"actorId":"nm0734076","character":"Jean-Hugues","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-Marie Benoît","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0072307","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1955","placeOfBirth":"","bio":"Jean-Marie Benoît was born in 1955.
