Thomas Howell was one of the most promising young actors in the mid 1980s. Christopher Thomas Howell was born in Los Angeles, California, to Candice (Webb) and Chris Howell, a professional bull rider turned stuntman. He started working in the film industry at the age of seven. In 1981, he was cast as Tyler in Steven Spielberg's E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Shortly thereafter, he nabbed the lead in Francis Ford Coppola's classic The Outsiders, starring opposite the likes of Diane Lane, Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, and Tom Cruise. It was Howell's gripping performance as the tough, yet vulnerable Ponyboy Curtis that made him a household name virtually overnight. Earmarked as an up-and-coming actor, Howell's career soon skyrocketed with roles in films including the comedy Grandview, U.S.A. (1984), alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, and the violent Cold War invasion drama Red Dawn (1984). His career was not helped by the controversial racial comedy Soul Man (1986), which was not well-received. However, he did meet and fall in love with his co-star from that movie, Rae Dawn Chong, whom he later married. Whilst superstardom has eluded him, there's no doubting that Howell has been in consistent demand with film producers. He has notched up in excess of 90 feature film appearances. including starring roles in Side Out (1990), Gettysburg (1993), Baby Face Nelson (1996), Fatal Affair (1998), Asylum Days (2001) and Hoboken Hollow (2006). He played unpredictable Officer Bill \"Dewey\" Dudek in the TNT smash drama Series Southland and as the serial killer \"The Reaper\" on CBS' Criminal Minds. His recent television appearances include The Glades on A&E as well as Torchwood on the Starz Channel. He also appeared in Sony's The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). A budding film director, he has directed a number of films, including The Big Fall, Pure Danger and Edgar Rice Burroughs The Land That Time Forgot. Outside of his acting career, Howell is an accomplished team roper. Known as a friendly and likable person to fans, he lives with his wife Sylvie, and their three children Isabelle, Dashiell and Liam.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ3NjIxMTA2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzQ2MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001367","name":"C.

Wilson has gained worldwide recognition starring in two enormously popular long running television series. Appearing in the hit series Dallas for five seasons playing opposite Patrick Duffy, and then for the entire eight year run of Walker, Texas Ranger opposite Chuck Norris. Currently, Ms. Wilson has starred and produced two feature films, Easy Rider: The Ride Back, a prequel to the cult favorite movie Easy Rider, and The Gundown. She also co-produced a zombie/comedy called Dug Up. While studying for her degree in fashion merchandising and business, Sheree secretly vied for a career in show business. As with many actors, that 'lucky break' came shortly after graduation in 1981 while working in Denver on a fashion shoot. One of the photographers thought Sheree was the model, and introduced her to Vicki Light, head of The Light Company. Vicki in turn introduced her to Wilhelmina, the modeling agenCY from New York, who signed her on the spot. Sheree promptly moved to Manhattan and within eighteen months, had appeared in over thirty commercial campaigns for Clairol, Sea Breeze, Keri-Lotion and Maybelline. Her print work ran in such popular magazines as Mademoiselle, Glamour and Redbook. After three years of modeling, Sheree's agent, Vicki Light, called her with an audition in a feature film, urging her to move to Los Angeles. She won the starring role, opposite Louise Lasser, Brian James and Reed Burney, in \"Crimewave\", a 1984 black comedy directed by Sam Raimi. Three days after that film wrapped, she was cast in \"Velvet,\" an ABC/Aaron Spelling MOW/series pilot, in which she played a female \"James Bond\" character opposite Shari Belafonte. Within the next year, she had a lead with Tim Robbins in \"Fraternity Vacation\", a summer comedy in which she played an intellectual beauty who was the object of everyone's desire. Producers began to take notice of this dynamic newcomer to Hollywood, and soon she starred in the 1985 CBS television miniseries \"Kane & Abel,\" with Peter Strauss. This immediately led to \"Our Family Honor,\" a CBS drama about Irish cops vs. the Mafia, in which she starred with Ray Liotta, Michael Madsen and Eli Wallach. Her career continued to grow including \"News at Eleven\" with Martin Sheen. And then, in 1986, television producer Leonard Katzman called Sheree to talk about a part he thought was tailor-made for someone with her classic beauty and sassy, fun-loving, energetic nature. The role was that of 'April Stevens' on the CBS mega-hit series \"Dallas.\" For five seasons she played a brainy, wealthy femme fatale. Her character went from being one of the most powerful women in Dallas and J.R. Ewing's nemesis, to being one of the warmest characters in town, eventually marrying Bobby Ewing, the show's ultimate good guy. Ultimately, April Stevens was gunned down during her honeymoon in Paris. Bowing out with a bang, Sheree's performance earned her the \"Soap Opera Digest Award\" for Best Death Scene. In fact, Sheree was pregnant and wanted to leave in order to fully devote herself to motherhood. At the end of 1992, she signed to do the lead female role of 'Alex Cahill' in \"Walker, Texas Ranger,\" opposite Chuck Norris, which ran for eight seasons. The daughter of two IBM executives, Sheree was born in Minnesota and moved to Colorado at the age of seven, where she learned to ride horses. Her superb equestrian skills won her first place riding cutting horses in the 1995 National Multiple Sclerosis Rodeo. Her love of horses continues to this day - as she recently rescued a retired racehorse and in 2008 helped establish the \"White Bridle Humane Society\", a horse rescue equine therapy non-profit organization in Texas of which she serves as vice-president. Currently, Sheree resides in Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NzUwNDI2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQxMzAxNTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934136","name":"Sheree J.
