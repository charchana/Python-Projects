Leads in school plays and summers at the National Youth Theater of Great Britain led to three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). In the Physical Theatre classes taught by Jane Gibson, who trained under Jacque le Coq in Paris, Jason found the acting and thinking tools that would inform his approach to his professional work. Graduating in 1981 after a three-month tour of Holland and Belgium playing Romeo in \"Romeo and Juliet\", Jason pursued his craft in a variety of roles. High points include playing Macbeth at Chichester Festival Theatre, three long runs in the London West End: \"The Sleeping prince\" with Omar Sharrif, Simon Gray's \"Melon\" with Alan Bates, Simon Gray's \"The Common Pursuit\" directed by the author, and Steven Berkoff's Royal National Theatre production of Oscar Wilde's \"Salome\". In British television, Jason starred in two series, a mini series, a number of TV movies and numerous guest star roles. Jason has enjoyed collaborating with many directors developing characters and evolving scenes. He worked closely with Jason Lehel whilst starring in \"Boiling Point\", Gil Cates JR. on \"The Mesmerist\", and Nick Ward on Working Title's \"Dakota Road\" for which, at the Festival du Cinema Britannique de Dinard, Jason received a commendation for his performance as \"Raif\" from chairman of the judges, Ben Kingsley. The director's chair is an as yet unrealized creative interest for Jason that he looks to pursue for the future in addition to his acting work. On American television Jason has had many roles, beginning with Connor, the hero's nemesis on the pilot episode of \"Viper\", and guest starring in many popular series including \"Beverley Hills 90210\", \"Angel\", \"Sentinel\", \"Lois and Clark\", and \"3rd Rock From The Sun\". When Jason auditioned for Marcus Cole on \"Babylon 5\", he had been told it was to guest star, and so was delighted when his surprised agent informed him it was a three-year contract and he had secured the role - a role that would change his life. Whilst making \"Babylon 5\", fine actor and dear friend, Richard Biggs suggested they partner up and develop fun classes to jointly share the craft they both loved. Richard and Jason would hold \"The Biggs and Carter Experience\" at conventions until Richard's death in 2004. In 2013, Jason can be found at international conventions celebrating the 20th anniversary of the \"Babylon 5\" pilot and on his public Facebook page, enjoying sharing both geeky humor, geeky fact, and geeky postulation.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI2ODY1MjAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc5ODQ1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0141682","name":"Jason
