Nakadai was subsequently cast in the lead role in Kobayashi's monumental trilogy 'Ningen no joken' and became a star whose international acclaim rivaled that of countryman Toshirô Mifune. Like Mifune, Nakadai worked frequently with director Akira Kurosawa and indeed more or less replaced Mifune as Kurosawa's principal leading man after the well-known falling out between Mifune and Kurosawa. His appearances for Kurosawa in Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980) and Ran (1985) are among the most indelible in the director's oeuvre.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzYwNDA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDExMTMwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619938","name":"Tatsuya Nakadai","nicknames":["Moya","The Snake"],"idIMDB":"nm0619938"},"actorId":"nm0619938","character":"Lord Hidetora Ichimonji","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011208","main":true},{"actorName":"Akira Terao","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855417","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 May 1947","placeOfBirth":" Kanagawa, Japan","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"Akira Terao is the son of the famous actor Jukichi Uno.
