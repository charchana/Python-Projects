Van Cleef started out as an accountant. He served in the U.S. Navy aboard minesweepers and subchasers during World War II. After the war he worked as an office administrator, becoming involved in amateur theatrics in his spare time. An audition for a professional role led to a touring company job in \"Mr. Roberts\". His performance was seen by Stanley Kramer, who cast him as henchman Jack Colby in High Noon (1952), a role that brought him great recognition despite the fact that he had no dialogue. For the next decade he played a string of memorably villainous characters, primarily in westerns but also in crime dramas such as The Big Combo (1955). His hawk nose and steely, slit eyes seemed destined to keep him always in the realm of heavies, but in the mid-Sergio Leone cast him as the tough but decent Col. Mortimer opposite Clint Eastwood in For a Few Dollars More (1965). A new career as a western hero (or at least anti-hero) opened up, and Van Cleef became an international star, though in films of decreasing quality. In the 1980s he moved easily into action and martial-arts movies, and starred in The Master (1984), a TV series featuring almost non-stop martial arts action. He died of a heart attack in December 1989, and was buried at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood Hills.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0ODU1NjY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI0NzEyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001812","name":"Lee Van Cleef","idIMDB":"nm0001812"},"actorId":"nm0001812","character":"Ryan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0414519","main":true},{"actorName":"John Phillip Law","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492342","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNjI5MzE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc4NzgyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 September 1937","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"John Phillip Law was born on September 7, 1937 in Los Angeles, California, USA.

He was born Anthony Douglas Gillon Dawson in Edinburgh, Scotland, to Ida Violet (Kittel) and Eric Francis Dawson. His father was Scottish and his mother was of German and English descent. Dawson made his greatest impact in the Alfred Hitchcock classic Dial M for Murder (1954). He was excellent as Lesgate, seedy ex-Cambridge classmate of would-be wife murderer Wendice (Ray Milland). In the scene where Wendice blackmails him to commit the killing (\"There were times I felt you belonged to me\"), he is nervous and visibly torn between fear and avarice. Dawson gave similarly sinister performances in the thriller Midnight Lace (1960), where he menaced hapless Doris Day, and the Terence Fisher-directed Hammer horror The Curse of the Werewolf (1961) as Count Siniestro. In another film by this director, the James Bond classic Dr. No (1962), Dawson played the geologist Prof. R.J.Dent, a henchman of the title character who attempts to assassinate the hero, then finds out to his cost what Bond's \"license to kill\" really means. Dawson was also the first screen incarnation of Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (in From Russia with Love (1963) and Thunderball (1965)), though the viewer only sees his hands stroking a white cat and hears the voice of Austrian actor Eric Pohlmann. A highly capable, immediately recognizable actor, Dawson deserved better roles than came his way after the mid-1960s. He eventually ended up playing small parts in minor Italian films and European co-productions, but should not be confused with the Italian horror director Antonio Margheriti who sometimes used the pseudonym 'Anthomy M. Dawson'. An interesting footnote to Dawson's career are his unpublished memoirs, \"Rambling Recollections\", in which he vividly recalls meeting Hitchcock after first arriving in Hollywood. This took place at a dinner party given by the director at Perino's Restaurant in Los Angeles. Also present were 'Dial M' co-stars Grace Kelly and English actor John Williams. Dawson later escorted Kelly to her residence at Chateau Marmont, an apartment bloc on Sunset Strip. Dawson then intimated that an affair took place, which, however lasted just until Ray Milland arrived on the scene.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NjM2NjQ0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkzNzQzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206060","name":"Anthony Dawson","idIMDB":"nm0206060"},"actorId":"nm0206060","character":"Burt Cavanaugh","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"José Torres","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868700","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1925","placeOfBirth":" Tocuyito, Venezuela","bio":"José Torres was born in 1925 in Tocuyito, Venezuela.
