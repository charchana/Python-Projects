Josephson's relationship with Bergman, a long-time friend, began in the late 1930s when they first worked together in the theater. Although he was in several motion pictures in the late 1940s and early '50s, including a bit part in Bergman's \"The Man With an Umbrella\" (1946), Josephson confined himself to the stage during the first part of his career. After appearing in Bergman's \"The Magician\" (1958) in support of Max von Sydow, Josephson did not make another movie until the late '60s, when he was cast in Bergman's \"Hour of the Wolf\" (1968). He collaborated on two screenplays with Bergman (using the joint pseudonym of Buntel Eriksson), Alf Kjellin's \"The Pleasure Garden\" (1961) and Bergman's own \"Now About These Women\" (1964). In 1966, Josepheson succeeded Bergman as creative director of the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, a post he held until 1975. He also succeeded Max Von Sydow as Bergman's favorite male lead in the 1970s, which brought him global fame. After co-starring with Von Sydow and Liv Ullmann in \"The Passion of Anna\" (1969), he had major roles in \"The Touch\" (1971), \"Cries and Whispers\" (1972), \"Scenes From a Marriage\" (a television mini-series edited into a film in 1973), and \"Face to Face\" (1976). François Truffaut, in his guise as a film critic, wrote in 1958: \"Bergman's preeminent strength is the direction he gives his actors. He entrusts the principal roles in his films to the five or six actors he loves best, never type-casting them. They are completely different from one film to the next, often playing diametrically opposite roles.\" In Bergman's films of the 1970s, Erland Josephson engendered the neurotic, post-war 20th century man: aloof, introspective, and self-centered. Josephson also appeared in Bergman's \"Autumn Sonata\" (1978), \"Fanny and Alexander\" (1982) and \"After the Rehearsal\" (1984). After starring in \"Trolösa\" (2000), a film directed by frequent co-star Liv Ullmann and scripted by Bergman, it was time for him to be reunited with Ullmann as an actress under the hand of the maestro himself with \"Saraband\" (2003). Josephson did not appear in a non-Swedish film until 1977, when he starred as Friedrich Nietzsche in Italian director Liliana Cavani's \"Beyond Good and Evil.\" He continued to work in international cinema in the 1980s and '90s, appearing in Franco Brusati's \"To Forget Venice (1980), Dusan Makavejev's \"Montenegro\" (1981), Philip Kaufman's \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" (1988), István Szabó's \"Hanussen\" (1988), and Peter Greenaway's \"Prospero's Books\" (1991). His most memorable non-Bergman roles were in the films of Andrei Tarkovsky, \"Nostalghia\" (1983) and \"The Sacrifice\" (1986). Behind the camera, Josephson co-directed \"One and One\", a 1978 full-length film, with fellow Bergman collaborators Ingrid Thulin and Sven Nykvist, and directed the full-length \"Marmalade Revolution\" (1980). Erland Josephson also is an accomplished writer: He has written screenplays for Swedish films, as well as dramas, novels, and poetry.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NTY4ODY2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTc1NzI3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430746","name":"Erland Josephson","idIMDB":"nm0430746"},"actorId":"nm0430746","character":"Dr. Tomas Jacobi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Aino Taube","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0851408","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYzNzJlZmEtNGFlOC00NWNlLWIxODEtYTMxMTAzZGIwMmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 July 1912","placeOfBirth":" Espergærde, Denmark","bio":"Aino Taube was born on July 11, 1912 in Espergærde, Denmark.

However, he first worked as a baker's apprentice, in a barber shop or in the docks. After the conscription he got his first role, a bit part on the theater Lilla Teatern in Stockholm, while he took acting lessons. One of his early roles was against Gösta Ekman, one of the best Swedish actors of that day. In the autumn 1933 he became a student at the Royal Dramatic Theater's acting school, along with Ingrid Bergman, Signe Hasso and the girl who was to become his lifelong wife, Lillie Björnstrand. After graduation they found employment at the Swedish Theater in Vasa, Finland. After two years of stage acting they returned to Sweden and outmost poverty. Besides small time stage acting he was only offered bit parts in the movies. In 1943 he made his breakthrough debut with Night in the Harbor (1943). During WW2 he also made his first work with Ingmar Bergman on the theater: August Strindberg's play Spöksonaten. He mainly appeared in light comedies until the movies that made him internationally famous: Ingmar Bergman's Sawdust and Tinsel (1953), A Lesson in Love (1954) and Smiles of a Summer Night (1955). He became a close friend of Mr. Bergman. The 1960s was less successful and when his contract with Svensk Filmindustri (SF) ended, it wasn't renewed. Instead he made TV-theater, theater in Sweden and movies in Italy almost until his death. Other interesting movies with him are Kristin Commands (1946), Soldat Boum! (1948) and Waiting Women (1952).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODQ4NjI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUyMDEyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085038","name":"Gunnar Björnstrand","idIMDB":"nm0085038"},"actorId":"nm0085038","character":"The Grandfather","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kristina Adolphson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0012358","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 September 1937","placeOfBirth":" Stockholm, Sweden","birthName":"Kristina Margareta Adolphson","bio":"Kristina Adolphson was born on September 2, 1937 in Stockholm, Sweden as Kristina Margareta Adolphson.

He got speech lessons from actress Sif Ruud and worked behind the camera in his father's and Ingmar Bergman's movies.
