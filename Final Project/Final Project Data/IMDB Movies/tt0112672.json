As he is often confused with actor Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Tony Leung Ka-fai is known as \"Big Tony\", while Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is known as \"Little Tony\", nicknames which correspond to the actors' respective physical statures. Leung has been in the film industry for more than 30 years, starring in a variety of roles. His debut film was Burning of the Imperial Palace (1983), where he played the Xianfeng Emperor. He would later work with Yun-Fat Chow in three films, Prison on Fire (1987), A Better Tomorrow III: Love and Death in Saigon (1989), and The Return of the God of Gamblers (1994). In 1991, Leung went to France to appear in Jean-Jacques Annaud's The Lover (1992), based on Marguerite Duras's novel, as the older lover of a young teen schoolgirl, who was played by British actress Jane March. Leung's ongoing career has seen him star in films such as The Myth (2005), Double Vision (2002), Everlasting Regret (2005) and Election (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTM3OTk5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMxODA1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504899","name":"Tony Ka Fai Leung","idIMDB":"nm0504899"},"actorId":"nm0504899","character":"Prince Kung","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kwok-Pong Chan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0150987","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc0OWUyM2EtZWIwNC00MDRiLWI4MjUtNWFmMjlhNGFkNzQxL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MTI5NzQ@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 February 1968","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong, British Crown Colony","bio":"Kwok-Pong Chan was born on February 4, 1968 in Hong Kong, British Crown Colony.

In 1991, she won Miss Hong Kong Pageant as the first runner up. She went back to Hong Kong University to finish her law degree before returning, in 1993, to her acting career. Chow's career kicked off with a good start with \"Wan 9 Zhao 5\" (Twenty Something), in which she played Alice, a girl who tries to find true love in Hong Kong's club scenes. Then came her big break, \"Chungking Express\", in which she plays the woman who broke Tony Leung's heart. She had only a few scenes, but made quite an impression. The blurry image of her wearing a bra and a skirt, walking around the house as if she is swaying in and out of space (and Leung's memory), made Chow a symbol of mysterious seduction. After Chungking Express, Chow did a 20-eposide TV series, playing the outside interest of a honest married man; who eventually divorced his fat, cooking-oil-soaked wife. The series itself was a huge success, but her role was not warmly received, and her career began to go downwards. She went on to star in a string of insignficant films, which either showed her as a two-dimensional seductress, or tried unsuccessfully to \"cleanse\" her image as a home-wrecker. She finally decided to move to the States and start fresh. However, Chow's career in Hollywood was equally uneventful, with the exception of her Revlon contract. After returning to Hong Kong, she found a job working for the marketing and events department of Lane Crawford, the Hong Kong equivalent of Neiman Marcus; and acting became her part-time job. Ironically, one of her latest part-time jobs, a 40-episode TV series called \"Hap Qua Yin Som\" (Healing Hearts), was her biggest success ever. Her role, a lawyer named Flora, was recognized as the perfect modern woman--smart, beautiful, and independent. The success of Healing Hearts led to another major cosmetic contract--Chow signed on to become the spokeperson for Neutrogena's whitening mask, a new line that was launched in Hong Kong.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDM4MDkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk4MjYyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0159513","name":"Valerie Chow","idIMDB":"nm0159513"},"actorId":"nm0159513","character":"Empress Dowager Tzu-an","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ping Ha","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0351719","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 October 1937","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong, China","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Ping Ha was born on October 6, 1937 in Hong Kong, China.

He is an actor and director, known for The Karate Kid (2010), Iron Monkey (1993) and Shanghai Noon (2000). He is best known for the title role in Iron Monkey along with Donnie Yen as well as being featured in films such as The East Is Red, My Father Is a Hero, and Musa. He has Weihai ancestry and his parents are Yu Ming Kui. His children are Yu Zi Long. Yu Rong-Guang has worked with some of the best performers in the Hong Kong film industry. Action superstars like Michelle Yeoh and Jackie Chan are just a sample of the talented costars that populate Yu's filmography. Perhaps thoughts of movie stardom crossed Yu's mind as a youth in Mainland China, as he trained diligently in the Peking Opera School. As Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao had done before him, Yu parlayed his opera training into an impressive martial arts film career. Since his debut, Yu-Rong Guang has made several notable screen appearances. His most famous is perhaps the title role in Iron Monkey (1993), which saw Yu appear alongside popular action star Donnie Yen. Other noteworthy film appearances include Swordsman III: The East is Red (1993) with Brigitte Lin Ching-Hsia and My Father is a Hero (1995), in which Yu played a villain to Jet Li's heroic protagonist. Though many U.S. audiences might be unfamiliar with Yu's Hong Kong work, his small appearance in Shanghai Noon (2000) may ring some bells. The actor made his American debut in this popular Jackie Chan-Owen Wilson comedy as an Imperial guard who briefly duels with Jackie Chan near the film's climax. Yu's recent performance in the South Korean film Musa: The Warrior (2001) ranks among one of his best. In the sweeping epic, Yu plays a Mongol general battling a ragtag group of Korean soldiers in the hopes of capturing a haughty Ming princess (portrayed by current Chinese \"It Girl\" Zhang Ziyi). Based on the overall quality of the films he has associated himself with over the last decade and a half, it would not be a stretch to predict even more winning film performances from Yu Rong-Guang in the years to come.
