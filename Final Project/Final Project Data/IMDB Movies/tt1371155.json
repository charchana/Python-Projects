In addition to the thousands of male employees, there are also 187 underpaid women machinists who primarily assemble the car seat upholstery in poor working conditions. Dissatisfied, the women, represented by the shop steward and Rita O'Grady, work with union rep Albert Passingham for a better deal. However, Rita learns that there is a larger issue in this dispute considering that women are paid an appalling fraction of the men's wages for the same work across the board on the sole basis of their sex. Refusing to tolerate this inequality any longer, O'Grady leads a strike by her fellow machinists for equal pay for equal work. What follows would test the patience of all involved in a grinding labour and political struggle that ultimately would advance the cause of women's rights around the world.","simplePlot":"A dramatization of the 1968 strike at the Ford Dagenham car plant, where female workers walked out in protest against sexual discrimination.","actors":[{"actorName":"Sally Hawkins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1020089","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE4MDE0MDEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI1NTU5MDE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 April 1976","placeOfBirth":" Dulwich, London, England, UK","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Sally Hawkins was born in 1976 in Lewisham hospital, London, England, to Jacqui and Colin Hawkins, authors and illustrators of children's books. She is of English and Irish descent. Hawkins was brought up in Greenwich, in southeast London. She attended James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich. She graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1998. Hawkins' theatre appearances include Much Ado About Nothing (2000), A Midsummer Night's Dream (2000), Misconceptions (2001), Country Music (2004), and David Hare's adaptation of Federico García Lorca's play The House of Bernarda Alba in 2005. Hawkins made her first notable screen performance as Samantha in the 2002 Mike Leigh film All or Nothing (2002). She also appeared as Slasher in the 2004 film Layer Cake (2004). She played the role of Zena Blake in the BBC adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel, Tipping the Velvet (2002) in 2002. Her first major television role came in 2005, when she played Susan Trinder in the BAFTA-nominated BBC drama Fingersmith (2005), an adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel of the same name, in which she co-starred with Imelda Staunton, as she had in Vera Drake (2004). Since then she has gone on to star in another BBC adaptation, Patrick Hamilton's Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky. Hawkins appeared in three episodes of the BBC comedy series Little Britain (2003), in addition to Ed Reardon's Week on BBC Radio 4. She has also contributed to the BBC Radio 4 series Concrete Cow. In 2006, Hawkins returned to the stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre in Jez Butterworth's The Winterling. In 2007, she played the lead in a new film of Jane Austen's Persuasion, and followed this with her critically acclaimed performance in Happy-Go-Lucky (2008). Questions and a minor controversy arose when Hawkins was not nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Poppy. It was the first year since 2000-01 that the winner of the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy was not nominated for an Academy Award, and the first year since 1995-96 that no one from the category was nominated. During 2006 she also made uncredited appearances in Richard Ayoade's Man to Man with Dean Learner where she played various uncredited roles from Personal Assistant to Wife of Steve Pising in various deleted scenes included on the DVD. Hawkins' 2009-10 films included Desert Flower (2009), Never Let Me Go (2010), and Happy Ever Afters (2009). In November 2010, she appeared on Broadway as Vivie in Mrs. Warren's Profession. In 2011, Hawkins appeared in Submarine (2010) and had a supporting role in the film adaptation of Jane Eyre (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE4MDE0MDEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI1NTU5MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1020089","name":"Sally Hawkins","idIMDB":"nm1020089"},"actorId":"nm1020089","character":"Rita O'Grady","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0230107","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrea Riseborough","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2057859","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MTUzNDAwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA0NjcyNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 November 1981","placeOfBirth":" Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England, UK","birthName":"Andrea Louise Riseborough","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Andrea Riseborough was born on November 20, 1981 in Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England as Andrea Louise Riseborough.

He is the son of Elsie Lillian (Hopkins), a nursery school teacher and cook, and Robert William Hoskins, Sr., who drove a lorry and worked as a bookkeeper. Growing up, Hoskins received only limited education and he left school at 15, but with a passion for language and literature instilled by his former English teacher. A regular theatre-goer, Hoskins dreamed of starring on stage, but before he could do so he had to work odd jobs for a long time to make ends meet. His acting career started out more by accident than by design, when he accompanied a friend to watch some auditions, only to be confused for one of the people auditioning, getting a script pushed into his hands with the message \"You're next\". He got the part and acquired an agent. After some stage success, he expanded to television with roles in television series such as Villains (1972) and Thick as Thieves (1974). In the mid-'70s, he started his film career, standing out when he performed alongside Richard Dreyfuss in John Byrum's Inserts (1975) and in a smaller part in Richard Lester's Royal Flash (1975). Hoskins broke through in 1978 in Dennis Potter's mini TV series, Pennies from Heaven (1978), playing \"Arthur Parker\", the doomed salesman. After this, a string of high-profile and successful films followed, starting with his true major movie debut in 1980's The Long Good Friday (1980) as the ultimately doomed \"Harold Shand\". This was followed by such works as The Cotton Club (1984), Mona Lisa (1986), which won him an Oscar nomination as well as a BAFTA award, Cannes Film Festival and Golden Globe), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) (Golden Globe nomination), Mermaids (1990), Hook (1991), Nixon (1995), Le voyage de Felicia (1999) and Enemy at the Gates (2001). Hoskins always carefully balanced the riches of Hollywood with the labor of independent film, though leaned more towards the latter than the former. He worked at smaller projects such as Shane Meadows' debut 24 7: Twenty Four Seven (1997), in which he starred as \"Allen Darcy\". Besides this, he found time to direct, write and star in The Raggedy Rawney (1988), as well as direct and star in Rainbow (1995), and contributing to HBO's Tales from the Crypt (1989) and Tube Tales (1999). Suffering from Parkinson's disease in later years, Hoskins died of pneumonia at age 71 in a London hospital.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTE0ODQyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIyNTk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001364","name":"Bob Hoskins","nicknames":["The Cockney Cagney"],"idIMDB":"nm0001364"},"actorId":"nm0001364","character":"Albert Passingham","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0238073","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Aubrey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3590660","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Matthew Aubrey is an actor, known for Everybody's Gone to the Rapture (2015), Made in Dagenham (2010) and Gracie!

Roger was educated at Bedales, a prestigious co-educational school in Hampshire, noted for a laid-back approach and a pronounced emphasis towards arts, crafts and drama. With inspiration provided by his drama teacher and rather liking the attention and applause that came with being on stage, Lloyd Pack managed to attain A-levels in languages. After leaving school, aged nineteen, he successfully auditioned for RADA, where one of his teachers was the actor Peter Barkworth. Soon after, he made his stage debut in the Elizabethan play \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\" at Northampton Repertory Theatre. From the beginning, Lloyd Pack always thought of becoming a Shakespearean actor. However, his career took him on quite a different path. His first television appearances were similar peripheral 'no-name parts' as cleaners, soldiers and constables. After years of toiling in relative obscurity, he finally managed to secure a recurring role as the vacuous, simple-minded road sweeper Colin 'Trigger' Ball in the sitcom Only Fools and Horses.... (1981). Appearing in nearly every episode of the long-running series, Lloyd Pack came to be identified with this character in the national consciousness to such an extent, that he could \"not go anywhere without anyone going on about it\". His next popular casting was no less fortuitous: that of the flatulent, somewhat seedy farmer Owen Newitt in The Vicar of Dibley (1994), lusting after Dawn French's extrovert cleric (when not entertaining dubious thoughts about farm animals). On the big screen, Lloyd Pack reached a wider audience as Bartemius Crouch Sr, a ruthless Ministry of Magic functionary in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), destined to be killed by his Death Eater son, played by David Tennant. Still more dramatic was his role as evil megalomaniac John Lumic (who creates an army of cybermen in his pursuit of immortality) menacing Tennant and company in the Doctor Who (1963) two-parter \"Rise of the Cybermen\" and \"The Age of Steel\", set on a parallel Earth. Lloyd Pack thoroughly enjoyed participating in the iconic series. Lloyd Pack's theatrical work encompassed performances at the National, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Court. He was much acclaimed for roles in plays by Harold Pinter and latterly portrayed the Duke of Buckingham in \"Richard III\" at the Globe. On screen, he was glimpsed as Inspector Mendel in La taupe (2011) and as a friar, friend of Cardinal Della Rovere, in The Borgias (2011). The actor was self-effacing in private life and was much esteemed by his peers. He was an avid supporter of Tottenham Hotspurs, cricket and left-wing causes. About his career, Lloyd Pack commented in an interview for The Independent (19th February 2009): \"I was not easy to cast, but also I have never been typecast. This was an advantage in the long run, because it opens a big range of parts for me, from Trigger to Freud. I have a rubbery face\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMDgxNTg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc5MTUwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516181","name":"Roger Lloyd Pack","idIMDB":"nm0516181"},"actorId":"nm0516181","character":"George","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0242599","main":true},{"actorName":"Phil Cornwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0180504","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0OTQ1MDg3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk1Nzg3NzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 October 1957","placeOfBirth":" Southend, Essex, England, UK","birthName":"Philip Cornwell","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Phil Cornwell was born on October 5, 1957 in Southend, Essex, England as Philip Cornwell.
