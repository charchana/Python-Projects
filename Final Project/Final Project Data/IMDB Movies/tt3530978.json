He is the son of Barbara Anne Brereton (Sharpe) and Paul Dugan Irons, an accountant. Young Jeremy didn't prove very fond of figures. A typical islander, he used to go to mainland England only once a year. He wound up being grounded when his family settled down in Hertfordshire. At the age of 13 he enrolled in Sherborne School, Dorset, where he was happy as he could practise his favorite sport, horse-riding. Before becoming an actor, he had considered a veterinarian surgeon's career. He trained at the Bristol Old Vic School for two years, then joined Bristol Old Vic repertory company where he gained much experience working in everything from Shakespeare to contemporary dramas. He moved to London in 1971 and had a number of odd jobs before landing the role of \"John the Baptist\" in the hit musical \"Godspell\". He went on to a successful early career in the West End theatre and on TV, and debuted on-screen in Nijinsky (1980). In the early 80s, he gained international attention with his starring role in the Granada Television serial adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel Brideshead Revisited (1981), after which he was much in demand as a romantic leading man. He went on to a steady film career. In 1984, he debuted on Broadway opposite: Glenn Close in Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\" and, in the mid-80s, he appeared in three lead roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Once described as 'the thinking woman's pin up', he has made his name in thought provoking films such as David Cronenberg's Faux-semblants (1988), for which he won the New York Critics Best Actor Award. He gained a Golden Globe Award in addition to an Oscar for Best Actor in 1990 for his role as Claus von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune (1990) alongside Glenn Close. Among his many achievements, his role as Professor Higgins in Loewe-Lerner's famous musical \"My Fair Lady\" mustn't be forgotten. It was in London, back in 1987. He is married to actress Sinéad Cusack, with whom he appeared in Waterland (1992) and in the Royal Shakespeare Company plays. He appeared with his son Samuel Irons and his father-in-law Cyril Cusack in the film Roald Dahl's Danny the Champion of the World (1989). His son Max Irons is also an actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Mzg2NDY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwNzA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460","name":"Jeremy Irons","idIMDB":"nm0000460"},"actorId":"nm0000460","character":"Ed Phoerum","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0540668","main":true},{"actorName":"Olga Kurylenko","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1385871","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMzIwMjY1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA3MDkwOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 November 1979","placeOfBirth":" Berdyansk, Zaporozhye Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, USSR [now Zaporizhia Oblast, Ukraine]","birthName":"Olga Konstantinovna Kurylenko","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Olga Kurylenko, a Ukrainian-born actress and model, went from sharing a cramped flat with her aunt, uncle, grandparents and cousin to starring as a Bond girl opposite Daniel Craig. She was born Olga Konstantinovna Kurylenko on November 14, 1979, in Berdyansk, Ukraine, Soviet Union. Her mother, Marina Alyabysheva, divorced her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, soon after her birth. After the divorce her mother struggled to survive as an art teacher. Young Olga was brought up by her mother and her grandmother, Raisa. During her youth Olga had the humbling experience of living in poverty; she had no choice but to wear rags and had to darn the holes on her sweater. During her years in Ukraine she studied art and languages and spent seven years studying piano at a local school of music in Berdyansk. She also went to a ballet studio until 13. At age 13 Olga and her mother made a trip to Moscow. There she was spotted by an agent, who approached her at a subway station and offered her a job as a model. Initially Olga's mother was suspicious, but she checked the agent's credentials and eventually allowed Olga to accept training as a model in Moscow, which turned out to be a good career choice. By age 16 she was ready for the next step. She moved to Paris, learned French in six months and was signed by the Madison agency. At age 18 she appeared on the cover of Glamour, and in short order graced the covers of Elle, Madame Figaro, Marie Claire, and Vogue. She also became the face of Lejaby lingerie, Bebe clothing, Clarins and Helena Rubinstein cosmetic companies. In 1999 Olga married French photographer Cedric Van Mol, but divorced him 3-1/2 years later. One day Olga presented herself to an acting agency. Eventually she swapped the catwalk for the movie screen, and her acting career took off. In 2005 she made her film debut as \"Iris\", a sensual beauty, in The Ring Finger (2005), by director Diane Bertrand. Olga's cinematic roles have been notably steamy, and her natural beauty and explicit nudity attracted the attention of the male audiences. She appeared opposite Elijah Wood in Paris, je t'aime (2006) and as \"Sofia\" in The Serpent (2006), then co-starred as Russian beauty \"Nika Boronina\" opposite Timothy Olyphant in Hitman (2007). She also appeared as \"Mina Harud\" in the indie surveillance-thriller Tyranny (2008). On Christmas Eve 2007, Olga was offered to play what will become her biggest hit: co-starring as \"Camille\", the Bond girl, opposite Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace (2008), a sequel to Casino Royale (2006). With the international success as Bond Girl, Olga also made appearances on various TV productions in Russia and Ukraine. In 2012, Olga Kurylenko was cast as Julia, supporting role in the Sci-Fi adventure Oblivion (2013) opposite Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyMzIwMjY1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA3MDkwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1385871","name":"Olga Kurylenko","idIMDB":"nm1385871"},"actorId":"nm1385871","character":"Amy Ryan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0540669","main":true},{"actorName":"Simon Johns","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2095679","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDA4NTMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExMzM3NTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Simon Johns is known for his work on Correspondence (2016), The Olive Branch Job (2013) and Zero (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDA4NTMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExMzM3NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2095679","name":"Simon Johns","idIMDB":"nm2095679"},"actorId":"nm2095679","character":"Jason","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0540670","main":true},{"actorName":"James Warren","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912879","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNzM2NDk3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc4MTA4NTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"James William John Warren was born in the Royal London Hospital in Mile End, Son of Beryl Warren a Company Director and John Edward Warren a Sculptor.
