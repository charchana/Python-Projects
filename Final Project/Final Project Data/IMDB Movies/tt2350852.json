Her parents divorced when she was young. At 15 she had to drop out of high school to help support the family, and worked at a succession of low-paying jobs. When she turned 18 she tried stripping for a living, but didn't like it and quit after only one day. A year later she met someone at a club who had connections to the adult-film industry and told her she would be perfect for that business. Intrigued, she decided to try it, and two days later was shooting her first porn scene at a studio in the San Fernando Valley. At first she used an agent to secure work, but soon realized that she could do better on her own and dropped him. She worked almost nonstop until she took a \"breather\" during the Christmas season of 2001 and didn't make any films for several months. When she came back in early 2002 she was hired by Jill Kelly Productions for one film, and they were so impressed with her that they offered her a contract, which she eventually accepted.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI4NzkxMTU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTExMDYwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1040252","name":"Jenna Haze","idIMDB":"nm1040252"},"actorId":"nm1040252","character":"Suzy Whitefeather","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Asia LeMasters","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4784697","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Asia LeMasters spent the first few years of her career as a script supervisor, and since moving to Los Angeles in 2013, has ventured into Production Managing, Assistant directing, and Producing.
