Before her, actors and actresses worked anonymously, partly out of fear that stage managers would refuse to hire them if they were found to be working in films and partly because movie executives didn't want to put much money into the production of these short, practically disposable films, and didn't want their players to become well known and start demanding higher salaries. Lawrence was on the stage from age three, appearing in musicals and plays, whistling and playing the violin. At 20 she was cast in the Edison production of Daniel Boone (1907), and that led to work at Vitagraph Studios. From there she was hired by Biograph, where she refined and perfected her craft under the direction of D.W. Griffith. In 1909 she left Biograph to seek more recognizable employment at another film company. As a result she was blacklisted by the Motion Picture Trust, headed by Thomas A. Edison, to which most motion-picture producers belonged and which held the patents on most film production equipment and would not allow any companies that did not belong to the Trust to use them. Carl Laemmle started IMP in late 1909, and refused to join the Motion Picture Trust. The Trust took action--both legal and otherwise--to discourage Laemmle from producing films on his own. Lawrence and her husband, director Harry Solter, signed on as IMP's first featured players. In 1910 Laemmle, partly out of anger over the Trust's actions--such as hiring thugs to attack his film crews and wreck his equipment--decided to advertise the fact that he had Miss Lawrence. She made the first personal appearance of a film star in St. Louis, MO, that March, and the resulting publicity made her famous (and also increased the grosses on her--and Laemmle's--films). Other film companies soon followed suit, and the names of film actors and actresses began to appear in all segments of the media. Lawrence worked for IMP for a year, then spent another year at Lubin before she began her own production company, Victor, where she worked on and off until 1914. After a stage accident in which she injured her back, she retired from films, only to be lured back in 1916 for her first feature, Elusive Isabel (1916). It was unsuccessful. She tried a comeback again in 1921; that, too, was unsuccessful. She settled into bit parts and character roles through the 1920s and 1930s. She committed suicide in 1938 after years of unhappiness and illness. She was found in her apartment on Dec. 27, 1938 and died soon afterward in hospital.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjE3NzUxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYxNTM0MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492757","name":"Florence Lawrence","nicknames":["\"Queen of the Screen\"","The 'Biograph Girl' and the 'Imp Girl.'"],"idIMDB":"nm0492757"},"actorId":"nm0492757","character":"Katharina","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004069","main":true},{"actorName":"Arthur V.

When he was 17, his parents moved the family to East Berlin, Connecticut, and he became a laborer at American Iron Works, a job he continued when they moved to Northampton, Massachusetts. He happened to meet Marie Dressler in 1902, and through her went to New York City to attempt for a career on the stage. He managed some burlesque and chorus-boy parts. In 1908, he began acting in Biograph films. His work there lasted until 1911; it included being directed by D.W. Griffith and acting with Mary Pickford and Mabel Normand. By 1910, he was directing. In 1912, he and two bookies-turned-producers--Adam Kessel and Charles Bauman--formed the Keystone Film Company. Sennett brought Mabel Normand with him and soon added Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, Chester Conklin Al St. John, Slim Summerville, Minta Durfee and Charles Chaplin (who was directed by Sennett in 35 comedies during 1914). He told Chaplin, \"We have no scenario--we get an idea, then follow the natural sequence of events until it leads up to a chase, which is the essence of our comedy.\" To the slapstick chase gags of the Keystone Kops were gradually added the Bathing Beauties and the Kid Komedies. In 1915 he, Griffith and Thomas H. Ince formed Triangle Films. Comedy moved from improvisational slapstick to scripted situations. Stars like Bobby Vernon and Gloria Swanson joined him. In 1917, he formed Mack Sennett Comedies, distributing through Paramount--and later Pathe--and launching another star, Harry Langdon. When Sennett returned to Paramount in 1932, he produced shorts featuring W.C. Fields and musical ones with Bing Crosby. After directing his only Buster Keaton film, The Timid Young Man (1935), he returned to Canada a pauper. In 1937, he was awarded a special Oscar--\"to the master of fun, discoverer of stars... for his lasting contribution to the comedy technique of the screen.\" Mack Sennett died at age 80 on November 5, 1960 in Woodland Hills, California, and was interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. For his contributions to the motion picture industry, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a star on Canada's Walk of Fame.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MTk4ODE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTc0NzU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784407","name":"Mack Sennett","nicknames":["The King of Comedy"],"idIMDB":"nm0784407"},"actorId":"nm0784407","character":"Petruchio's Servant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0088962","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0000770","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000770","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"01","month":"10","year":"1908","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"07","month":"10","year":"1908","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":"American Mutoscope &amp; Biograph Co."},"technical":{"runtime":["17 min (16 fps)"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["319 m (1 reel)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Coytesville, New Jersey, USA"}],"awards":[],"votes":"58","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0066927","name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["sister sister relationship","father daughter relationship","marriage","courtship","aggression","shakespeare's the taming of the shrew","farce","1600s","based on play"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 00:13:03"}}
