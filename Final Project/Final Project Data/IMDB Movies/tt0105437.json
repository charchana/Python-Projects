He played Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave. A later role was as Gaius, the court physician of Camelot, in the BBC drama Merlin. Wilson was born in Greenock, Scotland. He studied science in Greenock, and did National Service with the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in Singapore. He worked in a laboratory at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow as a research scientist before switching to acting at age 27. He trained at RADA and then appeared in repertory theatres in Edinburgh (Traverse Theatre), Glasgow and Manchester (Stables Theatre). He initially turned down the role of Victor Meldrew and it was almost offered to Les Dawson before Wilson changed his mind. Wilson was awarded the OBE for services to drama as a director and actor in 1994. In April 1996, he was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow for a term of three years. Wilson's biography, One Foot on the Stage: The Biography of Richard Wilson, was written by James Roose-Evans. Wilson has worked for the gay rights campaign group Stonewall and the Labour Party. He is one of the patrons of Scottish Youth Theatre. Wilson is also a long-time supporter of the charity Sense and in 2007 hosted their annual award ceremony. He is also one of the honorary patrons of the London children's charity, Scene & Heard. The narration of \"The Man Who Called Himself Jesus\", from Strawbs' eponymous first album, was performed by Wilson. He is a major supporter of the Labour Party, and he recorded the party's manifesto for the 2010 General Election. In March 2011, Wilson presented an edition of the Channel 4 current affairs programme Dispatches entitled Train Journeys From Hell, with transport journalist Christian Wolmar highlighting the failings of the British rail network. Wilson was a supporter of his local football club, Greenock Morton, but he has come to lend greater support to English club Manchester United. He is a patron of the Manchester United Supporters Trust. Wilson has been a campaigner for gay rights for many years, and he came out as gay in a Daily Mail interview in March 2013. Wilson is good friends with his One Foot in the Grave co-star Angus Deayton, and is godfather to Deayton's son. It was reported on 12 August 2016 that Wilson had suffered a heart attack. He had been due to reprise the role of Victor Meldrew in a one-man show at the 2016 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MTQ5NTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU3ODIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934014","name":"Richard Wilson","idIMDB":"nm0934014"},"actorId":"nm0934014","character":"Uncle Salvatore","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elaine Collins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172296","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Elaine Collins is an actress and producer, known for Mrs Brown (1997), Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life (1993) and Soft Top Hard Shoulder (1992).

He was recognisable stalwart of British television drama, a prolific \"I know the face, but\" performer of intelligence, authority and a distinctive countenance: large, beguiling eyes, pronounced cheekbones and latterly, a mighty shock of white hair, augmented by a slightly lisped diction. Held in high esteem by fellow members of the profession, he always gave good value: lending sharpness to the judiciary, geniality to the clergy or eccentricity to the scientist. He was born in Paisley, and despite his father's determination that he should be a lawyer (he was academically bright and even started working for a solicitor's firm after graduating from university) his love for theatre led to a zest for amateur dramatics and he was spotted by a director from The Wilson Barrett Company. They gave him his first professional role, and he quit the day job, ultimately appearing in over 100 productions for them at The Glasgow Alhambra during the late 40's/early 50's. Despite being extremely busy in television, he continued treading the boards for forty years, loving being a company man whether it be at The Liverpool Playhouse (where he met his wife) or The Almeida. His film appearances, initially as a bit player, included the Titanic film \"A Night To Remember\" (1958) in which he was among an illustrious bevy of British talent giving uncredited cameos (Norman Rossington, Desmond Llewellyn, Stratford Johns and Derren Nesbitt were literally in the same boat). James played the engine room officer, giving a touching performance that embodied the moving stoicism of the picture. In \"Doctor Who\", his affecting performance as conscience stricken scientist slowly losing his mind in \"The Power Of The Daleks\" (1966) is considered among the best performances given by a guest actor in the show. In person a witty, unassuming and modest man, he also lent his experience and encouragement to the Hadleigh Amateur Dramatic Society for whom he was a valued chairman.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416877","name":"Robert James","idIMDB":"nm0416877"},"actorId":"nm0416877","character":"Campbell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrew Downie","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0235973","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 May 1922","placeOfBirth":" Edinburgh, Scotland, UK","birthName":"Andrew Fraser Downie","bio":"Andrew Downie was born on May 26, 1922 in Edinburgh, Scotland as Andrew Fraser Downie.
