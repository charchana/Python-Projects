Her punishment is made all the more unbearable by the fact she has to live there with her mother Miriam - a well-intentioned blabbermouth who's convinced that the house is haunted. Kylie dismisses Miriam's superstitions as nothing more than a distraction from a life occupied by boiled vegetables & small-town gossip. However, when she too becomes privy to unsettling whispers & strange bumps in the night, she begins to wonder whether she's inherited her overactive imagination, or if the house is in fact possessed by a hostile spirit who's less than happy about the new living arrangement.","simplePlot":"A young woman is forced to return to her childhood home after being placed under house arrest, where she suspects that something evil may be lurking.","actors":[{"actorName":"Morgana O'Reilly","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2837410","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQyMDMyOTI0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA3MzQxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 August 1985","placeOfBirth":" New Zealand","height":"5' 5¼\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Morgana O'Reilly was born on August 19, 1985 in New Zealand.
