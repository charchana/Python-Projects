However, the breakthrough role in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (1960) made him one of the key figures in the French New Wave. Since mid-60s he completely switched to commercial mainstream pictures and became a big comedy and action star in France. Following the example of Alain Delon he founded his own production company Cerito named after his grandmother's maiden name. In 1989 he was awarded Cesar for his performance in Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté (1988) . Recently he returned to stage performing in the Theatre Marigny in Paris. He still appears in the movies but not so often as before preferring mostly dramatic roles. The president of France distinguished him with order of Legion of Honour. Belmondo has daughter Florence and son Paul. His elder daughter Patricia died in a fire in 1994. None of his children became actors though you could have seen his son Paul in the episodic role in Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté (1988).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MTAwNDUxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI0MDgzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000901","name":"Jean-Paul Belmondo","nicknames":["Bebel"],"idIMDB":"nm0000901"},"actorId":"nm0000901","character":"Le commissaire Jean Letellier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charles Denner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219342","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMDMxNDU0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTEwNzA3Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR14,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 May 1926","placeOfBirth":" Tarnów, Malopolskie, Poland","bio":"Mr. Denner began studying in Paris with Charles Dullin in 1945.
