The son of deaf parents, he learned sign language at an early age and, interestingly enough, developed a talent for dialects which allowed him to show off in a number of ethnic portrayals. In films from 1975 both here and abroad, his better roles have been in both contemporary and period pieces, such as Gorky Park (1983), Withnail & I (1987), King Ralph (1991), Guarding Tess (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999) and recently the 'Harry Potter' series as Uncle Vernon Dursley. Typically cast as comic relief in serious fare, he is well known in England for a number of comedy series including Pie in the Sky (1994).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NDc2MjY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODU5NjEzOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0341743","name":"Richard Griffiths","idIMDB":"nm0341743"},"actorId":"nm0341743","character":"Monty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0162809","main":true},{"actorName":"Ralph Brown","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0114460","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MDQ3ODY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEzNDc3Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 June 1957","placeOfBirth":" Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England, UK","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Ralph Brown was born on June 18, 1957 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England.

He will be best remembered for his role as Ken Boon in the hit series Boon (1986). He died tragically at the early age of 55. He had been in ill-health for some years, caused by a long-running battle with alcohol, which was exacerbated by the early death of his partner of many years. Best remembered for 'Boon', his career was no one-hit wonder. Elphick had been working in television for the past 33 years and his many excellent performances included Dennis Potter's Play for Today: Blue Remembered Hills (1979), as the bully, Peter; The Knowledge (1979), when he played a would-be London cab driver driven almost to despair by the sadistic examiner (played by Nigel Hawthorne); Private Schulz (1981), Auf Wiedersehen, Pet (1983) and Three Up Two Down (1985). His film career was arguably less successful, but none-the-less featured a rich and varied vein of characterisations. His final roles proved to be the film Dead in the Water (2002), in which he unfortunately had quite a small role, and millions saw his final television role, in EastEnders (1985), where he excelled in a very different role, showing just what a fine actor he was.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNzM4ODkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQyMDkwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0255573","name":"Michael Elphick","idIMDB":"nm0255573"},"actorId":"nm0255573","character":"Jake","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Daragh O'Malley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641713","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MzMwNDY5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg5NDQxNzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1954","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Daragh O'Malley is a leading Irish born film, theatre and television actor.
