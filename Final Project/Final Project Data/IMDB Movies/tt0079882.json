William Smith has done it all. He was born on March 24, 1933, in Columbia, Missouri, on Rolling Acres, a Hereford cattle ranch. After losing everything to the dust bowl, the family moved to California. From 1942, when he was eight, through young adulthood, Bill appeared in many movies as an extra (uncredited). After high school, he joined the Air Force and served during the Korean War and flew secret ferret missions over Russia while in the NSA. He studied at the University of Munich, and Syracuse University. He graduated cum laude at UCLA. Bill would go on to become one of Hollywood's best-known character actors, with over 300 TV and movie credits. On TV he played in many westerns (did his own horseback riding), cop and sci-fi shows. He's best remembered for appearing in Batman (1966) as, appropriately, Adonis in the last episode. He was a series regular in Hawaii Five-O (1968), where he played Det. James \"Kimo\" Carew (the episode with Cathy Lee Crosby, \"The Kahuna,\" drew particularly high ratings). On the big screen, Bill is legendary for biker flicks (he does his own motorcycle riding). His first biker flick, Run, Angel, Run! (1969), was shot in 13 days for under $100,000--and made $13 million! This was followed by Angels Die Hard (1970). These early, ground-breaking features defined the genre, and would be imitated endlessly (but never duplicated). In the early 1970s, Bill got into horror films--playing a vampire slayer in Grave of the Vampire (1972)--and science fiction, in the camp classic Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973), where he fought killer insect-women wearing sunglasses. Just about everybody's favorite William Smith movie, though, is Any Which Way You Can (1980), where as a bare-knuckle brawler he had a knock-down, drag-out fight with Clint Eastwood that wrecked about half the town. Tougher than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill played his dad in Conan the Barbarian (1982), and was one of the few actors in the wildly popular, but critically lambasted, youth-oriented Red Dawn (1984) to receive any recognition from critics. He was in what could be called a textbook example of low-budget, campy sci-fi, Hell Comes to Frogtown (1988). Just about everybody who has ever worked with Bill speaks highly of him. He's educated, intelligent and energetic. A true legend in the business, Bill's acting career is still going strong in 2006, well into the 64th year of his career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzQxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQyOTQ5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0810342","name":"William Smith","nicknames":["Big Bill"],"idIMDB":"nm0810342"},"actorId":"nm0810342","character":"Drew Savano","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Barbara Leigh","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500175","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNDkwMjc2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQyMTky._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 November 1946","placeOfBirth":" Ringgold, Georgia, USA","birthName":"Barbara Ann Kish","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Barbara Leigh was born on November 16, 1946 in Ringgold, Georgia, USA as Barbara Ann Kish.

Born Alfred Reginald Natzick in Vienna, Austria, the year of his birth has been a matter of speculation. While his obituary in the New York Times claimed 1922, photographic evidence has revealed that it was significantly earlier; most sources now cite 1911. Little is known about his early years. His mother was a beautiful actress who appeared in German films between 1919 and 1929. Nalder himself was an Apache dancer and stage actor in the 1920s and 1930s, and the anecdotes he occasionally shared with friends hint at a colorful career even before his life in films. Photos of Nalder from this period, which surfaced after his death, reveal a handsome young man in his early 20s, almost unrecognizable as the man we know from celluloid. The burns that scarred the lower third of his face and forever cast him as a villain are also a source of uncertainty; Nalder had at least three different explanations for them. Whatever the true cause, it was this disfigurement which bestowed upon him a permanent place in the annals of film. His career was punctuated by two definite high points. The first was his role as Rien, the leering assassin of Hitchcock's 1956 remake of \"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\" His second great triumph was as the horrifyingly effective vampire Barlow in the TV mini-series \"Salem's Lot\" (1979). In between he had some memorable film and television appearances -- the cold Russian operative in \"The Manchurian Candidate\" (1962); the yellow-jacketed gunman in Dario Argento's \"The Bird With the Crystal Plumage\" (1969), a part written especially for him; the lecherous witch-hunter Albino in Adrian Hoven's notorious \"Mark of the Devil\" (1970); the title character in the Thriller episode \"The Return of Andrew Bentley\" (1961); and the alien Shras, Andorian ambassador, in the classic Star Trek episode \"Journey to Babel\" (1967). Though small, Nalder's role in Fellini's \"Casanova\" (1976) was also a source of personal pride. Along the way were many forgotten roles, and a few of which he himself was embarrassed (he insisted on being credited as Detlef Van Berg in the sex films \"Dracula Sucks\" and \"Blue Ice\"). However dubious the quality of some of the films in which he appeared, his gaunt face, expressive eyes, and soft, haunting voice never fail to absorb. In real life, Nalder was soft-spoken man of considerable culture and taste who knew four languages and enjoyed the opera (\"Tosca\" was reputedly his favorite). He died of bone cancer at a Santa Monica nursing home on November 11, 1991. With him went the truth behind \"The Face That Launched a Thousand Trips\" and the keys to much of his mystery-shrouded past. Reggie Nalder may be far from a household name, and he may have appeared in many films of questionable artistic merit. But he has provided film buffs with indelible cinematic images and characterizations for which he was singularly well-equipped. Whether you were chilled by the methodical killer behind the curtain at the Albert Hall in \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" or terrified by the shining eyes of the vampire of \"Salem's Lot,\" you -- along with cinema-goers the world over -- have felt the icy touch of Reggie Nalder.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0620513","name":"Reggie Nalder","idIMDB":"nm0620513"},"actorId":"nm0620513","character":"Ronald Kahala 'The Hermit'","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Seth Sakai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757022","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 May 1932","placeOfBirth":" Hawaii, USA","bio":"Seth Sakai was born on May 22, 1932 in Hawaii, USA.
