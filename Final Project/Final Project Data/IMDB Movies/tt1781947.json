His mockumentary with sex drive, Casting Couch (2013), earned him Best Director and Best Writer at the 7th Annual Mockfest of Hollywood, then hit The CW as a \"Movie of the Week.\" The film has also gone on to see major airplay on Fox, ABC and Netflix. Jason's second feature, the veteran star-studded comedy/horror, Silent But Deadly (2012), earned him Best Director at the Hoboken International Film Festival and released to rave reviews for being quirky, fun, original and entertaining. Having grown up a \"child actor\" in the industry, Jason has since earned his degree in theatre, done over 60 plays across the country and worked on numerous national commercials and indie films, ranging from the original \"Click-It or Ticket Kid,\" to starring in the cult hit Vampire Boys (2011). It was his passions for business and storytelling that ultimately launched a writing career and quickly led him behind the camera. While living in Los Angeles, Jason also founded Webisoap.com (a former residence for cheesy soap series) and Quirkfest, an LA Comedy Film Festival. In 2013, Jason worked as an Executive Producer on National Lampoon's Another Dirty Movie (2012), and in 2014 he moved to Beverly Hills with his gorgeous wiener dog, Mo.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2Njg2MDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk1MDUyOTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0770647","name":"Jason Lockhart","nicknames":["J Lock"],"idIMDB":"nm0770647"},"actorId":"nm0770647","character":"Jasin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0242829","main":true},{"actorName":"Christian Ferrer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1101649","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Christian Ferrer is known for his work on Vampire Boys (2011), Eating Out: The Open Weekend (2011) and A Broken Code (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1101649","name":"Christian Ferrer","idIMDB":"nm1101649"},"actorId":"nm1101649","character":"Caleb","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0456725","main":true},{"actorName":"Dylan Vox","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1384079","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMTE5OTM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM4NjQwNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 December 1974","placeOfBirth":" Atlanta, Georgia, USA","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Dylan Vox was born on December 25, 1974 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
