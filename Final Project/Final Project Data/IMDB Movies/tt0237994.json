Co-starring with Hadas Yaron in Maxime Giroux's moving love tale Félix et Meira (2014). As Félix, a forty odd year old dropout, Dubreuil got into his role so well that the viewers all around the world soon had for him... the eyes of Meira! Unknown, Martin Dubreuil? For the rest of the world maybe but not for the people of Quebec (where he was born in 1976) where he is well-known both as an actor and a member of the Breastfeeders band. If you are one of their fans, you cannot not have noticed the eccentric exhibitionist tambourine player and occasional singer: it is Martin Dubreuil hiding under the name of Johnny Malodor. As a film actor (the 16 year old Martin had sworn he would become one after seeing Robert De Niro in Raging Bull (1980)), he has been more than active. He indeed appeared in dozens and dozens of films, even if he did in more shorts than features; but the meaning of it all is that the passionate thespian never says no to a project he deems of interest, whether he is well or underpaid, whether his role is big or small, whether the movie is long or short. During the first six years of his career he even acted exclusively in student movies. But little seen as they were, they did teach him the ropes of his trade. Usually freakish on the big screen, Dubreuil is nearly always violent, aggressive and out of sync. Most of the time you will see him in the guise of a punk, a junkie, a toughie or a brute. And often in works by major Quebec filmmakers such as Pierre Falardeau (Elvis Gratton II: Miracle à Memphis (1999), February 15, 1839 (2001) and Elvis Gratton 3: Le retour d'Elvis Wong (2004)), Eric Tessier (Sur le seuil (2003)), Patrick Huard (The 3 L'il Pigs (2007)) and Yves Christian Fournier (Everything Is Fine (2008)). To say nothing of his six collaborations with Maxime Giroux prior to 'Félix et Meira', the latter movie being an important milestone in Martin Dubreuil filmography inasmuch as it presents a double opportunity for him : its international release brings him wider recognition while on the other hand playing a sweeter character than usual (closer to true colors, by his own admission) showcases the full extent of his talent. Martin Dubreuil, an unknown artist? Nevermore!","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA1MzY4MTI1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg5NDYyNTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0239575","name":"Martin Dubreuil","idIMDB":"nm0239575"},"actorId":"nm0239575","character":"François-Xavier Prieur","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Roch Castonguay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0145393","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Roch Castonguay is an actor, known for February 15, 1839 (2001), La sacrée (2011) and Le party (1990).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0145393","name":"Roch Castonguay","idIMDB":"nm0145393"},"actorId":"nm0145393","character":"Jean Yelle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jerry Snell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811046","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jerry Snell was an actor and composer, known for Un zoo la nuit (1987), Coeur de métisse (1992) and February 15, 1839 (2001).
