Marina Vlady fell for Cristea Avram, and succeeded to convince Romanian authority to let him visit France. He never returned to Romania, and I think that he is still living in France. The fact that he left Romania, doesn't mean that his new actor AKA name should be used as his real name.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0043308","name":"Chris Avram","idIMDB":"nm0043308"},"actorId":"nm0043308","character":"Andrea","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lou Castel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0144589","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDIyNjczNjU5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMxMjM5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 May 1943","placeOfBirth":" Bogotá, Colombia","birthName":"Ulv Quarzéll","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"Lou Castel was born on May 28, 1943 in Bogotá, Colombia as Ulv Quarzéll.

Born on June 13th in 1929 in Barcelona, Cataluna, Spain, Israel attended the Escuela de actores de la Ciudad Condal. He began acting in films in the early 1960s. Short and dumpy, with a plain, round, pudgy face, thinning hair, medium height and build, snaggle teeth, a benign, humble, unassuming demeanor, and wide, moist, dark saucer eyes, Israel frequently portrayed ordinary working class types, timid cowards, men of the cloth, and meek victims. He soon began making frequent appearances in rugged action films and gritty Italian spaghetti Westerns; he has an especially memorable uncredited part as a weary sergeant at a rundown Confederate fort who Lee Van Cleef talks to in Sergio Leone's magnificent The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, ). In the late 1960s and up until the mid-'80s, Israel acted in an enjoyable slew of spooky horror features and entertainingly trashy exploitation fare. Among his more notable roles are a creepy handyman in The House That Screamed (1970) (The House That Screamed); a slimy, greedy, unctuous cemetery caretaker in The Butcher of Binbrook (1971) (Graveyard of Horror); a craven coachman in Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971); a whistling train baggage handler in the fantastic Horror Express (1972); a near deaf, vaguely menacing innkeeper in El monte de las brujas (1975) (The Witches' Mountain); a despicable and untrustworthy sniveling wimp nightclub owner in the splendidly sleazy Ricco (1973) (The Mean Machine); a scruffy, spineless mountain trail guide in the outrageous Night of the Howling Beast (1975) (Night of the Howling Beast); a zombie priest in Hell of the Living Dead (1980) (Hell of the Living Dead); and a boozy dock night watchman in the laughably lousy The Sea Serpent (1984) (The Sea Serpent). Israel continued to act in both movies and TV shows alike well into his 70s. He died at age 80 from natural causes on September 19, 2009 in Spain.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0411486","name":"Víctor Israel","idIMDB":"nm0411486"},"actorId":"nm0411486","character":"Giovanni","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0076571","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076571","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":[{"money":"ESP","country":"8,746,415","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 40 min (100 min)","1 hr 29 min (89 min) (Italy)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":["Eastmancolor"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"5.2","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"59","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0038811","name":"Cineiniziative S.R.L."},{"idCompany":"co0065841","name":"Cinema 2000 S.A."},{"idCompany":"co0031814","name":"Triton"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["cuckolded husband","coitus","infidelity","one female two males threesome","female nudity","female masturbation"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 08:02:06"}}
