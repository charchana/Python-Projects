Being of somewhat menacing demeanour, the cold-eyed, moustachioed Holmes quickly discovered his penchant for playing dastardly villains of French, Italian or Russian extraction. He was highly rated by critics for his Grand Duke Michael in The Prisoner of Zenda (1922) and for Alexander, nemesis of Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1924). His characters rarely ever survived the final reel. After leaving Fox, Holmes joined Metro for similar work and then segued into character parts after the coming of sound. He was signed as a Warner Brothers extra in the mid-30's and continued to amass uncredited or cameo bits until his retirement in 1964, by which time he had appeared in some 530 films. His wife, Blanche Maynard, was a well-known Hollywood astrologer and Holmes himself (when not busy on screen) spent his free time wood-carving. He was reputedly rather good at it.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVmNmY0MTUtZDU1Ny00YTIzLTkyMWMtZmE3ZWFjMWQ1NzA0L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0392059","name":"Stuart Holmes","idIMDB":"nm0392059"},"actorId":"nm0392059","character":"Otto von Hartrott","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0498879","main":true},{"actorName":"John St. Polis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0820821","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYxOWUyNWEtNWJiNi00ODJjLWFhYjctNDkxOTMyZjRjYmZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 November 1873","placeOfBirth":" New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Making his screen debut in 1914, St. Polis was well established as a character during the 1920s.

Ingram would make his third independent film in Italy when he directed Alice in 'The Garden of Allah (1927)'. Later that year, Alice would be reunited with Ramon Navarro in 'Lovers?
