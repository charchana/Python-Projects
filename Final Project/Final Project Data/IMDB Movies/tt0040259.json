Her mother was the one who inculcated her artistic gifts. She entered the Conservatory, where she studied singing and music. Still being an adolescent, she entered a children's company performing shows for children at the 'Teatro Español de la Plaza de Santa Ana' in Madrid. This way, she was hired several times to act in groups or with little roles in the classic theatre plays offered by Cayetano Luca de Tena, who was the director of the theatre at that time. She had her first chance with a part at Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. In 1944 she won a radio song contest, and then she was hired, together with Tony Leblanc, by the company owned by Lola Flores and Manolo Caracol, to play as secondary stars or 'Vedettes Americaines'. That was the starting point of her popularity. Her first works were in the cinema (Oro y marfil (1947), La muralla feliz (1947), Currito de la Cruz (1949), Servicio en la mar (1951)), but her best facet is theatre. She has a wide repertoire, including musical plays ('El hombre de la Mancha' [Man of La Mancha], 'La Perrichola', 'La corte del Faraón') and dramatic plays ('Fortunata y Jacinta', 'María Reyes', 'La zapatera prodigiosa', 'Anillos para una dama', among others). In 1997 she won a National Theatre Award.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0592980","name":"Nati Mistral","idIMDB":"nm0592980"},"actorId":"nm0592980","character":"Rocío Carmona","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0385445","main":true},{"actorName":"Tony Leblanc","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0495764","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGZlZmUwMjItNTE4My00YzBjLWFjY2ItN2EzOGE1ZmMyMTFlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 May 1922","placeOfBirth":" Villaviciosa de Odon, Madrid, Spain","birthName":"Ignacio Fernández Sánchez Leblanc","bio":"This actor started learning singing and dancing.

His entry in cinema was with little and secondary roles (Los últimos de Filipinas (1945) was his first film), many of them as what in spanish is said to be the 'chulo madrileño' (the typical classic Madrid city man, with his genuine verbal accent and special behaviour). With this type of roles he got great success in the 50's. Once he had become a known actor, he started his career as director and producer. He created his own production company and produced three films, but had no success at all with it and the company went to bankrupt. Finally, he decided to continue as an actor. In 1993 he was paid reverence in the Goya Awards Ceremony for his whole career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGZlZmUwMjItNTE4My00YzBjLWFjY2ItN2EzOGE1ZmMyMTFlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0495764","name":"Tony Leblanc","idIMDB":"nm0495764"},"actorId":"nm0495764","character":"Miguel Silverio 'Gazuza'","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0385446","main":true},{"actorName":"Juan Espantaleón","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0260771","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE1YWE1OTktMWE5ZS00Y2NlLWE4NDgtYTgxMGRiNmNmNTQ3L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 March 1885","placeOfBirth":" Seville, Spain","birthName":"Juan Espantaleón Torres","bio":"Juan Espantaleón was born on March 12, 1885 in Seville, Spain as Juan Espantaleón Torres.
