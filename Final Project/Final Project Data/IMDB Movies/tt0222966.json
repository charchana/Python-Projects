Then the hat is increased in size and he takes therefrom several chairs, after which the guests are produced from the same hat, consisting of two men and two women. They seat themselves at the table and proceed to eat of the good things provided, when the conjurer jumps backward on the table, and in the excitement everything disappears, leaving him as he was before with the original high hat.
