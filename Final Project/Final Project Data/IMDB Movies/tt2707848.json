Ulliel then took summer stages at Les Cours Florent and was asked by director André Téchiné to star in Les égarés (2003) as Emmanuelle Béart's lover. His role as Manech opposite Audrey Tautou in A Very Long Engagement (2004) brought him to stardom.

Born Helmut Steinberger in Salzburg in 1944, he turned down a prospect of running a family hotel business and went to London where he worked as waiter to pay his way through drama school. Later he attended the University of Perugia in Italy and spent some time in France. His acting career began with French and Italian commercials and showed no signs of progress until he was picked up by Luchino Visconti out of pool of \"extras\" during the shooting of Sandra (1965) in 1964. Berger's relationships with Visconti, whose partner he remained for 12 years, brought him to the attention of press and allowed him to act in some Visconti's films such as The Damned (1969) (\"The Damned), Ludwig - Le crépuscule des Dieux (1973) and Conversation Piece (1974) (\"The Conversation Piece\"). Visconti is said to view Berger as the very image of his idea of a \"demonic, insane and sexually perverted\" man. As a matter of fact Berger often portrayed anguished souls and sinister villains. His acting career continued throughout the 1970s but was temporarily broken up in the early 80s when he battled alcohol problem. He appeared in numerous French, Italian, German films and spent one season on American soap Dynasty (1981) but few directors used his gifts with the same skill as Visconti. His autobiography \"Ich\" (Me), in which he famously referred to his relationships with Visconti as \"marriage\" and claimed to be the director's widow, appeared in 1998. Berger is still very active appearing in TV series regularly. He also very modestly attributed his acting achievements to Visconti's directing.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMDg1NTk1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2MDgxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000918","name":"Helmut Berger","nicknames":["Heli"],"idIMDB":"nm0000918"},"actorId":"nm0000918","character":"Yves Saint Laurent en 1989","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0398725","main":true},{"actorName":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0116254","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjc4NjQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE5NDUxNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 November 1964","placeOfBirth":" Turin, Piedmont, Italy","height":"5' 7¼\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Valeria Bruni Tedeschi was born on November 16, 1964 in Turin, Piedmont, Italy.

She was then offered the female lead in Vittorio De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1970), as the provocative daughter of a rich Jewish family. Afterwards, she worked with Bernardo Bertolucci on the much-discussed The Conformist (1970), as the sensual wife of an anti-fascist professor, and co-starred with Paul Newman in John Huston's spy thriller, The MacKintosh Man (1973). She worked again with Bertolucci in the epic, 1900 (1976), and won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Prize for her performance in Mauro Bolognini's The Inheritance (1976), as an Italian patriarch's daughter-in-law. She gave one more unforgettable performance in Jacques Demy's original musical, A Room in Town (1982), as a femme fatale.
