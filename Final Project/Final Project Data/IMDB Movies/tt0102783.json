Creighton-Balfour","bio":"Michael Balfour possessed a chubby, lived-in face which seemed to convey a perpetual state of bewilderment. The ubiquitous character actor tended to pop up in just about every second 50's or 60's British B-movie or television episode, which usually found him typecast as obtuse cabbies, wisecracking sidekicks or dumb thugs. When his screen career began to slow down in the late 70's, he went on tour with European circuses as a clown. Balfour started his acting career on the repertory stage in 1936. Sometime in the mid-40's he decided to pass himself off as a former Detroit-born child actor in order to join the cast of a London production of \"Born Yesterday\". From then on, the American accent and leather bomber jacket became part of his screen personae. Indeed, he was so convincing, that some reference sources still cite him to this day as being American (he was actually born in Kent). In addition to being a performer, Balfour was also an accomplished painter and sculptor.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0050163","name":"Michael Balfour","idIMDB":"nm0050163"},"actorId":"nm0050163","character":"Gyles MacDonald","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Samantha Perkins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1042276","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Samantha Perkins is an actress, known for Revenge of Billy the Kid (1992), Knightmare (1987) and The Brittas Empire (1991).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1042276","name":"Samantha Perkins","idIMDB":"nm1042276"},"actorId":"nm1042276","character":"Ronnie MacDonald","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jackie D.

His father was a speech therapist and encouraged him to participate in diction and public speaking competitions. From this, the young Michael gained an interest in acting and got his first taste of the stage through his father's amateur dramatics company. At age 16, Ripper won a scholarship to drama school and began to appear in theater professionally. His stage career continued until 1952, when an operation for a thyroid condition left him unable to project his voice sufficiently for the stage, after which he concentrated on his film career. Ripper started his film career in numerous quota quickies, debuting in Father and Son (1936). At one point in his early career, he also worked as an assistant director for a production company at Walton Studios. In the late 1940s, Ripper began a long association with Hammer Film Productions, which resulted in his face becoming well known not only in Britain, but also worldwide. During this 25-year association, which began with a role in There Is No Escape (1948) and ended with That's Your Funeral (1972), Ripper made a total of 35 appearances in Hammer films, playing an assortment of innkeepers, coachmen, gravediggers, poachers, and, occasionally, authority figures, usually with a comic twist. Although he made few films after his stint with Hammer, he continued his career with memorable television appearances, such as the chauffeur in Butterflies (1978) and Drones Porter in Jeeves and Wooster (1990), until his retirement in the early 1990s.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0728085","name":"Michael Ripper","idIMDB":"nm0728085"},"actorId":"nm0728085","character":"Old Pub Local","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Gugolka","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0346604","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"John Gugolka is an actor and director, known for Our Mother's House (1967), Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969) and Revenge of Billy the Kid (1992).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0346604","name":"John Gugolka","idIMDB":"nm0346604"},"actorId":"nm0346604","character":"Will","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Abbott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007996","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 April 1945","placeOfBirth":"","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"John Abbott was born on April 19, 1945.
