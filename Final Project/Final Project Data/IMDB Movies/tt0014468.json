In the late 30s she settled in America and earned major Broadway success with the play \"Ladies in Retirement,\" which she also took to film in 1941. What the tiny-framed Elsom lacked in stature, she certainly made up for in pure chutzpah. The matronly actress remained in Hollywood and played a number of huffy bluebloods in both comedies and drama for over two decades, often as a minor Margaret Dumont-like foil to Jerry Lewis in his solo pictures of the late 50s and early 60s. She sometimes was billed under the last name of a second husband, appearing as Isobel Harbord.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0255695","name":"Isobel Elsom","idIMDB":"nm0255695"},"actorId":"nm0255695","character":"Mary Morstan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0052366","main":true},{"actorName":"Fred Raynham","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0713495","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Fred Raynham is an actor and writer, known for The Cavern Spider (1924), Expiation (1922) and The Sign of Four (1923).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0713495","name":"Fred Raynham","idIMDB":"nm0713495"},"actorId":"nm0713495","character":"Prince Abdullah Khan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Arthur M.
