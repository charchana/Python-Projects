Wendy grew up on Florida's Gulf Coast. Her father raced Corvette sports cars and was a test pilot for speed boats while her mother was a fashion model. Hamilton started out modeling swimsuits at age twelve in local fashion shows; she made her modeling debut at a shopping mall in Bradenton, Florida in 1979. Wendy was the captain of the basketball team the Hurricanes at Manatee High School in Bradenton. In 1988 she survived two brutal automobile accidents which occurred at the same exact Detroit intersection (one of these crashes sent her flying through the windshield of her car and the resultant severe injuries required 180 stitches). Hamilton was the Playmate of the Month in the December, 1991 issue of \"Playboy.\" Wendy was featured in a large number of \"Playboy\" videos and posed for a slew of \"Playboy\" newsstand special editions. Moreover, Wendy Hamilton not only made a guest appearance on an episode of the TV series \"NewsRadio,\" but also acted in several low-budget movies which include \"Ski School 2,\" \"The Dallas Connection,\" and \"Midnight Temptations.\"","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358212","name":"Wendy Hamilton","idIMDB":"nm0358212"},"actorId":"nm0358212","character":"Lola Schnitzelbank","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Noah Heney","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376979","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Noah Heney is an actor, known for Snow Falling on Cedars (1999), Le détonateur (1998) and Ski School 2 (1994).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376979","name":"Noah Heney","idIMDB":"nm0376979"},"actorId":"nm0376979","character":"Lee","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Will Sasso","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766005","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5ODk3MDk1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjYxMzky._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1975","placeOfBirth":" Ladner, British Columbia, Canada","birthName":"William Sasso","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Will Sasso was born in Ladner, British Columbia (a suburb of Vancouver), to a family of Italian descent. He grew up respecting comedy of all styles, thanks in part to an unhealthy relationship with the family television that began when Will was around two or three. With his mind consequently bent, Sasso decided at an early age to become an actor. At the age of fifteen, he landed his first agent and quickly began booking roles in television and film. Before moving from Vancouver to Los Angeles, Sasso starred for five seasons as the quirky teen, \"Derek Wakaluk\" on the award-winning Canadian dramatic series Madison (1993) allowing him to hone his acting and improvisational skills as well as providing him with enough money to buy a television of his own. Will starred for five seasons on FOX's hit sketch comedy series MADtv (1995) giving TV viewers a reason to stay up late with characters like the accident-prone handyman \"Paul Timberman\" and offbeat impressions of Bill Clinton, Kenny Rogers, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steven Seagal and Randy Newman. After a successful tenure with the show beginning in 1997, Sasso decided to leave the late-night staple in 2002, eager to explore the next stage of his career. Moviegoers know Sasso from his roles in more than twenty-five feature films including Best in Show (2000), directed by Christopher Guest, Belles à mourir (1999), Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) starring the late Chris Farley, and The Hot Chick (2002) starring Rob Schneider and produced by Adam Sandler, with whom Sasso previously worked on Happy Gilmore (1996). More recently, Sasso can be seen every week as \"Carl Monari\" on the ABC sitcom Less Than Perfect (2002). In his spare time, Sasso enjoys the outdoors and the indoors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5ODk3MDk1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjYxMzky._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766005","name":"Will Sasso","idIMDB":"nm0766005"},"actorId":"nm0766005","character":"Tomcat","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brent Sheppard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0791926","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 August 1960","placeOfBirth":"","birthName":"Brent James Douglas Sheppard","bio":"Brent Sheppard was born on August 1, 1960 as Brent James Douglas Sheppard.
