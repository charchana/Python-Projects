At age 12, he played Momo in La vie est un long fleuve tranquille (1988) by Étienne Chatiliez. He stopped his studies at age 16 to become an actor. But he had a dual personality: on one hand the man of low budget films like La fille seule (1995), Une minute de silence (1998), Le roi danse (2000), Déjà mort (1998), Thieves (1996), Selon Matthieu (2000) alongside Nathalie Baye, La fleur du mal (2003), Errances (2003), The Children of the Century (1999) with Juliette Binoche, La demoiselle d'honneur (2004) with Laura Smet, The Piano Teacher (2001) alongside Isabelle Huppert, and on the other hand also wide audience releases like Nid de guêpes (2002), Les rivières pourpres 2 - Les anges de l'apocalypse (2004), Trouble (2005), Effroyables jardins (2003), and Les chevaliers du ciel (2005). Charming, ambiguous, talented Benoit Magimel will probably illuminate the next decade, and more.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNjYwNjc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc4ODIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0536095","name":"Benoît Magimel","idIMDB":"nm0536095"},"actorId":"nm0536095","character":"Capitaine Antoine \"Walk'n\" Marchelli","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Clovis Cornillac","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0180404","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxODA4Mzk2NDReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDQzMzcwNw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 August 1967","placeOfBirth":" Lyon, Rhône, France","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"Clovis Cornillac was born on August 16, 1967 in Lyon, Rhône, France.
