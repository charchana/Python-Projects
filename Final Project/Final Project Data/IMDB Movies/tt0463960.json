Due to her parents' work, she spent her early childhood traveling around Europe. Pike attended Badminton School in Bristol, England and began acting at the National Youth Theatre. While appearing in a National Youth Theatre production of \"Romeo and Juliet\", she was first spotted and signed by an agent, although she continued her education at Wadham College, Oxford, where she read English Literature, eventually graduating with an upper second class honors degree. Pike appeared in a number of UK television series, including Wives and Daughters (1999), before scoring an auspicious feature film debut as the glacial beauty \"Miranda Frost\" in the James Bond film, Die Another Day (2002); when the film was released, she was only 23. Though her debut was a big-budget action film, the film work that followed was primarily in smaller, independent films, including Terre promise (2004), The Libertine (2004), (for which she won the Best Supporting Actress award at The British Independent Film Awards), and Pride & Prejudice (2005), as one of the Bennet daughters. A brief foray into Hollywood film followed with the action flick, Doom (2005), and the thriller, Fracture (2007), but she returned to smaller films with exceptional performances in three films: An Education (2009), Made in Dagenham (2010), and the lead opposite Paul Giamatti in Le monde de Barney (2010). As she continued her stage work in England, Pike appeared in the spy spoof, Johnny English Reborn (2011), and inhabited the role of \"Andromeda\" in the sci-fi epic, La colère des Titans (2012). She returned to action films with the female lead opposite Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher (2012). Pike entered into a relationship with a mathematical researcher named Robie Uniacke in 2009. She gave birth to their first son, named Solo, in May 2012. She returned to acting and landed the coveted title role in Gone Girl (2014). The film became a critical and box-office hit, with Pike earning the film's sole Academy Award nomination as Best Actress. She also earned nominations as Best Actress from Screen Actor's Guild, Golden Globes, and BAFTA. She gave birth to her second son with Uniacke in December 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjIxMzA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwNzU0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683253","name":"Rosamund Pike","nicknames":["Ros"],"idIMDB":"nm0683253"},"actorId":"nm0683253","character":"Zoe Hughes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0300952","main":true},{"actorName":"Lena Olin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000565","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Nzc2ODMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg4ODgwMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 March 1955","placeOfBirth":" Stockholm, Stockholms län, Sweden","birthName":"Lena Maria Jonna Olin","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Swedish-born Lena Olin already had a successful career as an actress before she came to Hollywood. She acted at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm and was directed by Ingmar Bergman. She was born in Stockholm, to actors Britta Holmberg and Stig Olin, who appeared in six of Bergman's films. Lena also belongs to the Bergman \"family\". As a young actress, she played in the great classics of William Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg. She made her international debut as a movie actress in After the Rehearsal (1984) (aka \"After the Rehearsal\"), directed by Bergman. In western Europe, she became well-known in the political movie The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988) as \"Sabina\", in a story about the Prague spring (1968). After coming to the US, she played mostly distinguished, exotic temptresses, intelligent women and crude vamps. Bergman had developed Lena's artistic gift to play different human emotions and express them in a subtle way. Sydney Pollack, director of Out of Africa (1985), rewrote the screenplay for Havana (1990) especially for her. This explains why this film recalls associations with the classic Casablanca (1942), starring Ingrid Bergman, also from Sweden. Olin received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Enemies: A Love Story (1989). She went on to have a choice role in Chocolat (2000), which received a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. She made a move to the smaller screen and played the role for one season as the deliciously evil \"Irina Derevko\", the mother to Jennifer Garner's \"Sydney Bristow\" in the series Alias (2001). Olin received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Nzc2ODMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg4ODgwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000565","name":"Lena Olin","idIMDB":"nm0000565"},"actorId":"nm0000565","character":"Kathryn Vale","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dean Winters","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935921","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGQ2NWVmMjctOGNjOC00MTZmLWI4OTEtMzQ1ZDg0NzFmOWNjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTU3NjQ2OTk@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 July 1964","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Dean Gerard Winters","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"Dean Winters is best known for his role as \"Ryan O'Reily\" on HBO's award-winning series Oz (1997).

Bern's earliest acting included work with Mercedes Reuhl, Samuel L.

He promised himself he'd return to acting at a later date. Years of experience in public education and the private sector gave Bern a mature, evolved edge when he resumed his acting career in 2005. He furthered his study of Camera Acting with Penny Templeton and Ruth Nerkin and has since had starring and principal roles in more than 50 movies, including Doctor Bello with Isaiah Washington and Vivica A. Fox, Frank Vs God with Henry Ian Cusick, Devil You Know with Lena Olin, Holy Rollers with Jesse Eisenberg, and 27 Dresses with Katherine Heigl.

Lawrence was born Jennifer Shrader Lawrence on August 15, 1990 in Louisville, Kentucky, to Karen (Koch), who manages a children's camp, and Gary Lawrence, who works in construction. She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and has English, German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Her career began when she traveled to Manhattan at the age of fourteen. After conducting her first cold read, agents told her mother that \"it was the best cold read by a 14- year-old they had ever heard\", and tried to convince her stage mother that she needed to spend the summer in Manhattan. After leaving the agency, Jen was spotted by an agent in the midst of shooting an H&M ad and asked to take her picture. The next day, that agent followed up with her and invited her to the studio for a cold read audition. Again, the agents were highly impressed and strongly urged her mother to allow her to spend the summer in New York City. As fate would have it, she did, and subsequently appeared in commercials such as MTV's \"My Super Sweet 16\" and played a role in the movie, The Devil You Know (2013). Shortly thereafter, her career forced her and her family to move to Los Angeles, where she was cast in the TBS sitcom The Bill Engvall Show (2007), and in smaller movies like The Poker House (2008) and The Burning Plain (2008). Her big break came when she played Ree in Winter's Bone (2010), which landed her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. Shortly thereafter, she secured the role of Mystique in franchise reboot X-Men: First Class (2011), which went on to be a hit in Summer 2011. Around this time, Lawrence scored the role of a lifetime when she was cast as Katniss Everdeen in the big-screen adaptation of literary sensation The Hunger Games (2012). The film went on to become one of the highest-grossing movies ever with over $407 million at the domestic box office, and instantly propelled Lawrence to the A-list among young actors/actresses. Three Hunger Games sequels were released in each consecutive November, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014), and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015), with Lawrence reprising her role. In 2012, the romantic comedy, Silver Linings Playbook earned her the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Satellite Award and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress, among other accolades, making her the youngest person ever to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actress and the second-youngest Best Actress winner. She starred in David O. Russell's popular drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), as Roselyn Rosenfield, and teamed with the director again to play inventor Joy Mangano in another family comedy, Joy (2015), receiving Oscar nominations for both roles (Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress, respectively).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxNzc4MDU1MjBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDk5Nzg3MTgx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2225369","name":"Jennifer Lawrence","nicknames":["Jen","JLaw"],"idIMDB":"nm2225369"},"actorId":"nm2225369","character":"Young Zoe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0300952","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephen Gevedon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315342","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMjU3MDk4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAwMDQyMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 March 1966","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Stephen Howard Gevedon","height":"6' 4½\" (1.94 m)","bio":"Stephen Gevedon was born on March 30, 1966 in New York City, New York, USA as Stephen Howard Gevedon.
