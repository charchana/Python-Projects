Celia Austin, a pharmacological major, confesses that she is a kleptomaniac and responsible for most of the thefts but denies stealing several objects including a stethoscope, light bulbs, and a student rucksack. Furthermore, she claims to know the other thief and vows to help return the missing items. Unfortunately someone substitutes an overdose of morphine for one of her sleeping powders, and she takes the identity of the thief to the grave. Japp connects the murderer's m.o. with a cold case he had investigated ten years earlier, but the prime suspect in that crime, a powerful statesman, now lies dying in a local hospital. Despite numerous obstacles, Poirot is able to link the killing to an international diamond smuggling ring but not before the murderer claims more victims.","simplePlot":"Miss Lemon persuades Poirot to investigate a series of apparently minor thefts in a university hostel, but simple kleptomania soon turns to baffling homicide.","actors":[{"actorName":"David Suchet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0837064","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4Mjg3ODA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI4Njg4OA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 May 1946","placeOfBirth":" Paddington, London, England, UK","birthName":"David C. Suchet","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Best known in the United Kingdom and abroad as Agatha Christie's suave Belgian super-sleuth Hercule Poirot in scores of late 1980s and '90s mini-movies, London-born actor David Suchet's early interest in the theater led to his membership with the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain in the 1960s following graduation from high school. He then studied for three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts and, after a significant route in repertory work, became a company member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1973 where he was also evolved as one of its dominant players by decade's end. In the 1970s Suchet also began to come into his own on British television. In classical tradition, his first television movie was A Tale of Two Cities (1980). His first cinema detective has been a Greek inspector in the Disney mystery-comedy Trenchcoat (1983), followed by a range of film roles that express the width of his acting qualities, such as a Middle Eastern terrorist in The Little Drummer Girl (1984), a Russian operative in The Falcon and the Snowman (1985), a French hunter in Harry and the Hendersons (1987), a Polish bishop in Le complot (1988) and Napoleon in in Sabotage! (2000). His masterful work in television roles also includes portrayals of historical, biblical, entertainment and fictional figures, such as Sigmund Freud in Freud (1984), news reporter William L. Shirer in Murrow (1986), Aaron in La bible: Moise (1995), movie mogul Louis B. Mayer in RKO 281 (1999), Cardinal Wolsey in Henry VIII (2003)), vampire nemesis Van Helsing in Dracula (2006) and Robert Maxwell in Maxwell (2007). Widely regarded as the one of greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally, David Suchet always offers staggering work full of generously euphoric delight, with a theatre course that includes memorable stunning incarnations such as the Shakespearean ones of Iago in \"Othello\", Tybalt in \"Romeo and Juliet\", Caliban in \"The Tempest\" and \"Timon of Athens\", as well as in roles such as George in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" in 1996 and, from 1998 to 2001, as composer Salieri in \"Amadeus\", a mesmerizing performance for which he received a Tony nomination after its Broadway presentation. Long wed to former actress Sheila Ferris, the couple has a son and daughter. His older brother is BBC newscaster-turned-journalist John Suchet.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4Mjg3ODA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI4Njg4OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0837064","name":"David Suchet","idIMDB":"nm0837064"},"actorId":"nm0837064","character":"Hercule Poirot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013286","main":true},{"actorName":"Philip Jackson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413946","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NzUwMDc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjUxMjg0OA@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 June 1948","placeOfBirth":" Retford, Nottinghamshire, England, UK","bio":"Philip Jackson was born on June 18, 1948 in Retford, Nottinghamshire, England.

Firth later had an opportunity to showcase a fuller range of emotion and acting skill as the very complicated Sergeant Troy in a superior remake of Far from the Madding Crowd (1998). More recently, Mr. Firth was cast as the morally upright Prince Albert in A & E's production of Victoria & Albert (2001).
