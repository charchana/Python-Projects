Serkis","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Andrew Clement G. Serkis was born April 20, 1964, in Ruislip Manor, West London, England. He has three sisters and a brother. His father, Clement Serkis, an ethnic Armenian whose original family surname was \"Serkissian\", was a Medical Doctor working abroad, in Iraq; the Serkis family spent a lot of time traveling around the Middle East. For the first ten years of his life, Andy Serkis used to go backwards and forwards between Baghdad and London. His mother, Lylie (Weech), who is British-born, was busy working as a special education teacher of handicapped children, so Andy and his four siblings were raised with au pairs in the house. Young Andy Serkis wanted to be an artist; he was fond of painting and drawing, and visualized himself working behind the scenes in productions. He attended St. Benedict's School, a Roman Catholic School for boys at the Benedictine Abbey in London. Serkis studied visual arts at Lancaster University in the north-west of England. There, he became involved in mechanical aspects of the theatre and did stage design and set building for theatrical productions. Then, Serkis was asked to play a role in a student production, and made his stage debut in Barrie Keeffe's play, \"Gotcha\"; thereafter, he switched from stage design to acting, which was a real calling that transformed his life. Instead of going to an acting college, Serkis, in 1985, began his professional acting career at the Duke's Playhouse in Lancaster, where he was given an Equity card and performed in fourteen plays, one after another, as an apprentice of Jonathan Petherbridge. After that, he worked in touring theatre companies, doing it for no money, fueled by a sense of enthusiasm, moving to a new town every week. He has thus appeared in a host of popular plays and on almost every renowned British stage. In 1989, he appeared in a stage production of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", so beginning his long association with the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, where he would return many times, to appear in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"Your Home in the West\" and the \"True Nature of Love\", among other plays. In the 1990s, Serkis began to make his mark on the London stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre as \"The Fool\" in \"King Lear\", making his interpretation of \"The Fool\" as the woman that \"Lear\", a widower, could relate to - a man, in drag, as a Victorian musician. He also appeared as \"Potts\" in the hit play, \"Mojo\", playing in front of full houses and earning huge critical success. In 1987, Serkis made his debut on television, and he acted in several major British TV miniseries throughout the 1990s. In 1999, Andy Serkis landed the prize role of \"Gollum\" in Peter Jackson's epic film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's saga, \"The Lord of the Rings\". He spent four years in the part and received awards and nominations for his performance as \"Gollum\", a computer-generated character in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), which won 11 Oscars. \"Gollum\" was the collaborative team's effort around Serkis's work in performance capture - an art form based on CGI-assisted acting. Serkis's work was an interactive performance in a skin-tight CGI suit with markers allowing cameras to track and register 3D position for each marker. Serkis' every nuance was picked up by several cameras positioned at precisely calculated angles to allow for the software to see enough information to process the image. The images of Serkis' performances were translated into the digital format by animators at Weta Digital studio in New Zealand. There, his image was key-frame animated and then edited into the movie, Serkis did have one scene in \"The Return of the King\" showing how he originally had the ring, killing another hobbit to posses it after they found it during a fishing trip. He drew from his three cats clearing fur balls out of their throats to develop the constricted voice he produced for \"Gollum\" and \"Sméagol\", and it was also enhanced by sound editing in post-production. Serkis spent almost two years in New Zealand and away from his family, and much of 2002 and 2003 in post-production studios for large periods of time, due to complexity of the creative process of bringing the character of \"Gollum\" to the screen. Serkis had to shoot two versions for every scene; one version was with him on camera, acting with (chiefly) Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, which served both to show Wood and Astin the moves so that they could precisely interact with the movements of \"Gollum\", and to provide the CGI artists the subtleties of Gollum's physical movements and facial expressions for their manual finishing of the animated images. In the other version, he'd do the voice off-camera, as Wood and Astin repeated their movements as though \"Gollum\" were there with them; that take would be the basis for inserting the CGI Gollum used in the released movie. In post-production, Serkis was doing motion-capture wearing a skintight motion capture suit with CGI gear while acting as a virtual puppeteer redoing every single scene in the studio. Additional CGI rotomation was done by animators using the human eye instead of the computer to capture the subtleties of Serkis' performance. Serkis also used this art form in his performance as \"Kong\" in King Kong (2005), which won him a Toronto Film Critics Association Award (2005) for his unprecedented work helping to realize the main character in \"King Kong\", and a Visual Effects Society Award (2006) for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Motion Picture. Apart from his line of CGI-driven characters, Serkis continued with traditional acting in several leading and supporting roles, such as his appearances as \"Richard Kneeland\" opposite Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30 (2004), and \"Alley\" opposite David Bowie in The Prestige (2006), among other film performances. On television, he starred as 'Vincent Van Gogh' in the sixth episode of Simon Schama's Power of Art (2006), the BBC2 series about artists. Serkis is billed as \"Capricorn\" in the upcoming adventure film, Coeur d'encre (2008). At the same time, he continued the development of performance capture while expanding his career into computer games. He starred as \"King Bothan\" in the martial arts drama, Heavenly Sword (2007), a Playstation 3 title, for which he provided a basis for his in-game face and also acts as a dramatic director on the project. Andy Serkis married actress and singer Lorraine Ashbourne, and the couple have three children: daughter Ruby Serkis (born in 1998), and two sons Sonny Serkis (born in 2000) and Louis George Serkis (born on 19 June 2004). Away from acting, Andy Serkis is an accomplished amateur painter. Since his school years at Lancaster, being so close to the Lake District, Serkis developed his other passion in life: mountaineering. He is pescetarian. Serkis has been active in charitable causes, such as The Hope Foundation, which provides essential life-saving medical aid for children suffering from Leukemia and children from countries devastated by war. In October 2006, he was a presenter at the first annual British Academy Video Games Awards at the Roundhouse, London. Andy Serkis lives with his family in North London, England.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNzI2OTA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDIwNzA1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0785227","name":"Andy Serkis","nicknames":["Gollum"],"idIMDB":"nm0785227"},"actorId":"nm0785227","character":"Caesar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003449","main":true},{"actorName":"Karin Konoval","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0465269","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MTY3MDM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ0MzE4MzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Karin Konoval has appeared in guest starring roles in numerous TV series and supporting lead roles in many feature films, including the role of \"Maurice\" (the orangutan) in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and War for the Planet of the Apes.

His mother, Betsy Franco, is Jewish, and his father, Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, was of Portuguese and Swedish descent, and ran a Silicon Valley business. James's mother, a writer, has occasionally acted. Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Whatever It Takes (2000). Although he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy. Next was Deuces Wild (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean (2001). He was recently seen in David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Nights in Rodanthe (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' In the Valley of Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyOTc0MjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgyODQwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556","name":"James Franco","nicknames":["Ted, Teddy"],"idIMDB":"nm0290556"},"actorId":"nm0290556","character":"Will Rodman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0223489","main":true},{"actorName":"Freida Pinto","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2951768","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5NDI0MzM0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ4NTIwNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 October 1984","placeOfBirth":" Bombay, Maharashtra, India [now Mumbai, Maharashtra, India]","birthName":"Freida Selena Pinto","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Freida Selena Pinto was born in Bombai (now Mumbai), Maharashtra, India, to Sylvia, a school principal, and Frederick Pinto, a senior bank branch manager.

He was born in Rochester, New York, to Sarah Jane (Price), an actress, and Arthur Washington Lithgow III, who was both a theatrical producer and director. John's father was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, where the Anglo-American Lithgow family had lived for several generations. John moved frequently as a child, while his father founded and managed local and college theaters and Shakespeare festivals throughout the Midwest of the United States. Not until he was 16, and his father became head of the McCarter Theater in Princeton New Jersey, did the family settle down. But for John, the theater was still not a career. He won a scholarship to Harvard University, where he finally caught the acting bug (as well as found a wife). Harvard was followed by a Fulbright scholarship to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Returning from London, his rigorous dramatic training stood him in good stead, and a distinguished career on Broadway gave him one Tony Award for \"The Changing Room\", a second nomination in 1985 for \"Requiem For a Heavyweight\", and a third in 1988 for \"M. Butterfly\". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion, and in the mid 1970s, he and his wife divorced. He entered therapy, and in 1982, his life started in a new direction, the movies - he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp (1982). A second Oscar nomination followed for Terms of Endearment (1983), and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife. As the decade of the 1990s came around, he found that he was spending too much time on location, and another career move brought him to television in the hugely successful series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996). This production also played a role in bringing him back together with the son from his first marriage, Ian Lithgow, who has a regular role in the series as a dimwitted student.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMzUyNDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMwNTU5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001475","name":"John Lithgow","nicknames":["Jiggles"],"idIMDB":"nm0001475"},"actorId":"nm0001475","character":"Charles Rodman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0256179","main":true},{"actorName":"Brian Cox","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004051","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNDUwMDMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU3MDQ1._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 June 1946","placeOfBirth":" Dundee, Scotland, UK","birthName":"Brian Denis Cox","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Brian Cox is an Emmy Award-winning Scottish actor.
