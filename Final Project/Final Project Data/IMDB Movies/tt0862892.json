She grew up in the cultural excitement of Southern California. Encouraged to explore every artistic avenue available to her, she soon found her love for acting was equaled by her passion for painting. Her acting career was kicked into high gear at a very young age, when she was cast as the strong-willed heroine of Clive Barker's quintessential horror classic, \"Hellraiser\". The award winning actress subsequently appeared in a wide variety of roles for film and TV, including the highly acclaimed Red (2008), Lightning Bug (2004), ER (1994) and national advertising campaigns for GEICO Insurance, Coors Lite beer AT&T. She first appeared as Kirsty Cotton in Hellraiser (1987), then reprized her role in the sequel Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988) and had a cameo appearance in Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992). The only other entry in the series to feature Laurence is _Hellraiser: Hellseeker (2002)_. Laurence has also starred in Lurking Fear (1994) (an adaptation of the H.P. Lovecraft story) and Savate (1995). She was featured in E! True Hollywood Story: Scream Queens (2004). In 2004 she took a role in \"Lightning Bug\", in which she played the mother of a teenage boy who wants to become a special makeup effects artist (a fictionalized version of director Robert Hall's own life). In a homage to her role in the \"Hellraiser\" films, she is seen picking up a copy of Fangoria magazine with Pinhead on the cover. Though most of her work has been in film, during the course of her career she has appeared in episodes of such TV series as Suddenly Susan (1996), \"ER\" and Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), and has been featured in national TV commercials for GEICO Insurance as well as having been the sexy Coors Light \"Beerman\" in one of the company's national ad campaigns. She was also featured in the Hallmark Channel television movies Gentle Ben (2002) and Gentle Ben 2: Black Gold (2003). In 2008 she appeared in \"Red\", based on the novel by Jack Ketchum. She also appeared in Slipknot's short film for their song \"Snuff\", which was released in December 2009.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTUzNjAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI1MjYzMDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491090","name":"Ashley Laurence","idIMDB":"nm0491090"},"actorId":"nm0491090","character":"Maria","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shaun Kurtz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1334629","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Shaun Kurtz is an actor and producer, known for Chill (2007), Black Cat (2004) and The Sixth (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1334629","name":"Shaun Kurtz","idIMDB":"nm1334629"},"actorId":"nm1334629","character":"Dr. Munoz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0053830","main":true},{"actorName":"James Russo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0751638","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTExMjczMTIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxNTI5MTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 April 1953","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"James Vincent Russo","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, \"The Candy Store\", while attending college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one's back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable \"tough guy\" performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in \"Extremities\" on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized Farrah Fawcett), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include Kevin Costner's The Postman (1997) and Open Range (2003), plus Beverly Hills Cop (1984), We're No Angels (1989), Donnie Brasco (1997), No Way Home (1996), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has \"Welcome to Andromeda\", \"Deathwatch\", \"Marat/Sade\" and the afore-mentioned \"Extremities\" to his credit. Russo appeared opposite Johnny Depp in Roman Polanski's La neuvième porte (1999), and portrayed mobster \"Victor Mura\" in TV's short-lived, Falcone (2000), the following year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as Frank Sinatra in Stealing Sinatra (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTExMjczMTIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxNTI5MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0751638","name":"James Russo","idIMDB":"nm0751638"},"actorId":"nm0751638","character":"Detective Defazio","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Victor Grant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2384280","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Victor Grant is an actor and writer, known for Chill (2007), The Harimaya Bridge (2009) and Strongmen (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2384280","name":"Victor Grant","idIMDB":"nm2384280"},"actorId":"nm2384280","character":"Tre","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Clark Moore","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2226083","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWVlY2QzODItODZjNS00YjkzLTlmYWQtYmI0OTA1NDgyZTQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDgyNDA1MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Clark Moore Grew up in the border town of Laredo Texas and spent lots of his time working at the ranch which allowed him to be outdoors.
