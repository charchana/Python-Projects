The speaker, of course, was Lundigan. He had gotten the announcing job because his father owned the building that housed WBFL.

The Rathbones escaped to England, where Basil and his two younger siblings, Beatrice and John, were raised. Their mother, Anna Barbara (George), was a violinist, who was born in Grahamstown, South Africa, of British parents, and their father, Edgar Philip Rathbone, was a mining engineer born in Liverpool. From 1906 to 1910 Rathbone attended Repton School, where he was more interested in sports--especially fencing, at which he excelled--than studies, but where he also discovered his interest in the theater. After graduation he planned to pursue acting as a profession, but his father disapproved and suggested that his son try working in business for a year, hoping he would forget about acting. Rathbone accepted his father's suggestion and worked as a clerk for an insurance company--for exactly one year. Then he contacted his cousin Frank Benson, an actor managing a Shakespearean troupe in Stratford-on-Avon. Rathbone was hired as an actor on the condition that he work his way through the ranks, which he did quite rapidly. Starting in bit parts in 1911, he was playing juvenile leads within two years. In 1915 his career was interrupted by the First World War. During his military service, as a second lieutenant in the Liverpool Scottish 2nd Battalion, he worked in intelligence and received the Military Cross for bravery. In 1919, released from military service, he returned to Stratford-on-Avon and continued with Shakespeare but after a year moved onto the London stage. The year after that he made his first appearance on Broadway and his film debut in the silent Innocent (1921). For the remainder of the decade Rathbone alternated between the London and New York stages and occasional appearances in films. In 1929 he co-wrote and starred as the title character in a short-running Broadway play called \"Judas\". Soon afterwards he abandoned his first love, the theater, for a film career. During the 1920s his roles had evolved from the romantic lead to the suave lady-killer to the sinister villain (usually wielding a sword), and Hollywood put him to good use during the 1930s in numerous costume romps, including Captain Blood (1935), David Copperfield (1935), A Tale of Two Cities (1935), Anna Karenina (1935), The Last Days of Pompeii (1935), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Tower of London (1939), The Mark of Zorro (1940) and others. Rathbone earned two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actor as Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet (1936) and as King Louis XI in If I Were King (1938). However, it was in 1939 that Rathbone played his best-known and most popular character, Sherlock Holmes, with Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson, first in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939) and then in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939), which were followed by 12 more films and numerous radio broadcasts over the next seven years. Feeling that his identification with the character was killing his film career, Rathbone went back to New York and the stage in 1946. The next year he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Dr. Sloper in the Broadway play \"The Heiress,\" but afterwards found little rewarding stage work. Nevertheless, during the last two decades of his life, Rathbone was a very busy actor, appearing on numerous television shows, primarily drama, variety and game shows; in occasional films, such as Casanova's Big Night (1954), The Court Jester (1955), Tales of Terror (1962) and The Comedy of Terrors (1963); and in his own one-man show, \"An Evening with Basil Rathbone\", with which he toured the U.S.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNjkzNzU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDM2MjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001651","name":"Basil Rathbone","nicknames":["Ratters"],"idIMDB":"nm0001651"},"actorId":"nm0001651","character":"Marley's Ghost","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000492","main":true},{"actorName":"Ray Middleton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0585553","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJiOGRjZGEtNzc5ZS00ZjBkLTk4NDctY2UxYjk3OTk3Yjc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 February 1907","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Raymond Earl Middleton Jr.","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Ray Middleton was born on February 8, 1907 in Chicago, Illinois, USA as Raymond Earl Middleton Jr. He was an actor, known for 1776 (1972), I Dream of Jeanie (1952) and Mercy Island (1941).

While not handed many roles that would show off her true acting mettle, Sally, whose slight resemblance to Marjorie Lord was noticeable, nevertheless photographed beautifully and was captivating enough to leave her mark in 1950s films. Born in Williston, North Dakota, on December 12, 1932, she moved to Southern California with her family (the youngest of five children) after spending a few years in Minneapolis. Her father subsequently bought and operated a feed store in the Canoga Park area of Los Angeles and worked there after school. As a young girl she expressed an interest in singing and joined her church choir while taking voice lessons. Spotted after singing on a local TV show, the pert beauty was encouraged to take drama courses and started to gain experience in local and summer stock plays, including \"Bus Stop\" with Marie Wilson, \"Separate Tables\" with Don Porter and Signe Hasso and \"The Moon Is Blue\". Finding a theatrical agent Sally's move into television came as a result of her singing skills (in a way). It was a TV version of \"A Christmas Carol\" starring Fredric March as Scrooge and Basil Rathbone as Marley's Ghost. She played both Belle and The Ghost of Christmas Past but her singing voice would be dubbed by operatic diva Marilyn Horne. She went on to appear in a number of western shows such as The Gene Autry Show (1950), Annie Oakley (1954) and Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok (1951). A vivacious presence in lighter fare, Sally made guest appearances on \"December Bride,\" \"Bachelor Father,\" \"Mr. Lucky\" and took her last job in the late 1960s in \"Lassie\". As for films, following a bit role in her debut film All I Desire (1953), she nabbed the female lead opposite Edmund Gwenn and a canine in the sentimental fantasy It's a Dog's Life (1955). Sally quickly found herself pocketed in low-budget 50s sci-fiers. She played the wife of Peter Graves who becomes possessed by aliens in the Roger Corman quickie It Conquered the World (1956); the brave sister of the colossal man in War of the Colossal Beast (1958); and a mother protecting her baby in The Spider (1958). Others included Giant from the Unknown (1958), the racing car programmer Roadracers (1959), and Dangerous Charter (1962). Rare quality films also came her way such as Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) and the Burt Lancaster starrer Elmer Gantry (1960), but her roles would be minuscule. Fraser continued to work on stage (\"Jenny Kissed Me\" with Rudy Vallee and \"the musical \"Of Thee I Sing\" with George Wallace) and TV and well into the 60s until she decided to retire to raise her family. She eventually moved to Idaho in the 80s and lives on a cattle ranch. Her husband has a manufacturing business.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzkwYjFlMWEtODAyNy00ZjU5LWExYmItZTZjOGJkYmRlYjg4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA4NDY2Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0292229","name":"Sally Fraser","idIMDB":"nm0292229"},"actorId":"nm0292229","character":"Belle / Spirit of Christmas Past","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000498","main":true},{"actorName":"Craig Hill","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0384154","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdlMjdmOTQtMWFkMi00OWQ5LWEyMTMtYjJlYTc0ZWFjYWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 March 1926","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Craig Hill Fowler","bio":"Craig Hill was born on March 5, 1926 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Craig Hill Fowler.
