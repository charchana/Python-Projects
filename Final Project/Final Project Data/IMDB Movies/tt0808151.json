He moved around a lot after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no abuse, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He had no acting experience in college and, in fact, credits the fact that he couldn't get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. He met his second wife, actress Rita Wilson on the set of his television show Bosom Buddies (1980) - she appeared in one episode in the second season (1981), Bosom Buddies: All You Need Is Love (1981). They have two children, and Tom has another son and daughter by his first wife, Samantha Lewes.

He became a star in his teens through the title role in the TV-series Bombi Bitt och jag (1968). Between the years 1972-88 he was employed at The Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, where he participated in \"Vita rum\" (1988), August Strindberg's \"Ett drömspel\" (1986) and \"Mäster Olof\" (1988). Simultaneously Skarsgård did outstanding film roles, notably in The Simple-Minded Murderer (1982) by Hans Alfredson and with Fred Ward in American Playhouse: Noon Wine (1985). The fantastic performance gave him both a well-earned Guldbagge and Silver Berlin Bear. He portrayed the Skagen-painter Sören Kröyer in Hip Hip Hurrah! (1987) and the Swedish ambassador Raoul Wallenberg in Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg (1990), both directed by Kjell Grede.

He also had the leading part in the Oscar nominated Oxen (1991) directed by the world-famous cinematographer Sven Nykvist. Skarsgård did his first (but small) role in an big American film with The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). The role of Captain Tupolev in The Hunt for Red October (1990) was at supposed to be biggest part in a Hollywood-film, but unfortunately it was cut down. His breakthrough instead came with Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves (1996) opposite newcomer Emily Watson. After that Skarsgård got several supporting roles in American films, such as in My Son the Fanatic (1997), Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting (1997) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NDUzOTY0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYxODE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001745","name":"Stellan Skarsgård","nicknames":["Skarzie"],"idIMDB":"nm0001745"},"actorId":"nm0001745","character":"Commander Richter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0144031","main":true},{"actorName":"Pierfrancesco Favino","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269419","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY1ZmYyNzEtODFiMS00OGJmLWIwYmYtMDk3NjQ2YmJlMjFjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk1MzE3MjI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 August 1969","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Pierfrancesco Favino was born on August 24, 1969 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.

While other actors strive to close in on life, Kaas - who experienced tragic loss at an early age - seems eager to escape the eye of the storm. It is a disturbing quality that etches his characters in the audience's mind. Kaas graduated from the National Theater School in Denmark in 1998. He first appeared on screen in Søren Kragh-Jacobsen's film _Drengene Fra Sankt Petri (1991)_ (The Boys from Sct. Petri) in 1991 as Otto, the rebel son of a traitor. The development of the character illustrates the growth of moral resistance into full-fledged violent revolt. This somber and masterfully-acted part earned Kaas two Danish film prizes, a Robert and a Bodil. Today Kaas imbues his adult characters with the unsentimental innocence and vulnerability of a child and audiences respond intuitively. Jeppe in 'Lars Von Trier''s _Idiots, The (1998)_ takes on true love, only to lose it. The actor received another Bodil for this portrayal. Kaas makes a narrow escape from type-casting by adding original qualities to the individual characters. He has also done self-parody as a happy-go-easy cook, working for a mafia-like boss in the midst of a murderous streak in In China They Eat Dogs (1999) (In China they eat dogs) and as a helpless man in the throes of love in Flickering Lights (2000) (Blinking lights). After imbuing smaller parts with larger-than-life performances, Kaas landed another main part in _Rigtigt menneske, Et (2001)_ (Truly human, 2001) as Ahmed, the aborted son (!) of a working couple. His would-be little sister is the emotionally neglected Lisa. When she dies, Ahmed comes to life and tries to become a real human being. Kaas delivers another masterful performance in this movie, inspired by the tragic tale of Casper Hauser.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMjcxODQ4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM4MDkyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0509263","name":"Nikolaj Lie Kaas","idIMDB":"nm0509263"},"actorId":"nm0509263","character":"Assassin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0144051","main":true},{"actorName":"Armin Mueller-Stahl","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000090","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTI3NTk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE3MDAxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 December 1930","placeOfBirth":" Tilsit, East Prussia, Germany [now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia]","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Armin Mueller-Stahl was born on December 17, 1930 in Tilsit, East Prussia, Germany.

At 12, he was cast as the role of the mailman in Negerkys og labre larver (1987), and later that year, he acted as a classmate in Bille August's film Pelle the Conqueror (1987), which, in 1988, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1989, he played the lead role in the \"The Neverending Story\" by Michael Ende in Roskilde, Denmark. But it was a children's play. After the few small roles Thure had played, he realized that he wanted to become a real actor. Lindhardt graduated from Odense Theatre School in 1998. In 1999, Thure was named recipient of the Reumert Award for Best New Talent. He had roles in two TV productions showing the year 2000, Denmarks Radios Edderkoppen (2000) a TV series where he played the poor boy Billy and in the Lars von Trier-produced family saga Morten Korch - Ved stillebækken (1999). His first notable role was that of Brian in A Place Nearby (2000), directed by Kaspar Rostrup, written by the novel of the same name of 'Martha Christensen' and produced by Tina Dalhoff. The film featured in the official selection at the 50th Berlin Film Festival. He played the lead as an autistic boy who is suspected of murder, and he received rave reviews for his performance and was named Shooting Star at the festival. This was followed by Shaky González's film One Hell of a Christmas (2002) where he played the part as the young cool criminal Mike. Later in the year 2002, he got the offer to play Slim in the Ballerin brothers' very special modern film Slim Slam Slum (2002). But the film really tested very poorly with the young audiences, and it became a Danish, bottom-10 comedy film. But in 2004, he did an outstanding job in the role of Hans in the German movie Love in Thoughts (2004)--the latter of which brought him to the public's attention. He is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation and portrays the weird junkie boy Steso in Ole Christian Madsen's fantastic film Angels in Fast Motion (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1MjMyNDE4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTMwMTQzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511892","name":"Thure Lindhardt","nicknames":["Steso","Thøger"],"idIMDB":"nm0511892"},"actorId":"nm0511892","character":"Chartrand","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0139466","main":true},{"actorName":"David Pasquesi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664727","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwMzkyNzU2NDleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDc0MTM1NDgx._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"David Pasquesi is an actor and writer, known for Veep (2012), Groundhog Day (1993) and Angels & Demons (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwMzkyNzU2NDleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDc0MTM1NDgx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664727","name":"David Pasquesi","idIMDB":"nm0664727"},"actorId":"nm0664727","character":"Claudio Vincenzi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0393870","main":true},{"actorName":"Cosimo Fusco","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299289","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE1MDY5MDU2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI0ODg0OTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 September 1962","placeOfBirth":" Matera, Basilicata, Italy","birthName":"Cosimo Massimo Fusco","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Cosimo Fusco was born on September 23, 1962 in Matera, Basilicata, Italy as Cosimo Massimo Fusco.
