In between, he also played Barlow in the miniseries Jack the Ripper (1973) (which, in turn, led to a 'cold case' investigation series called Second Verdict (1976)). He even spoofed his famous screen detective on The Two Ronnies (1971). His perennial sidekick was the actor Frank Windsor (in the role of Sergeant Watt), who once jokingly referred to their on-screen partnership as being \"the Morecambe and Wise of serious television\". Johns was educated in Pietermaritzburg in Natal Province. He began working life as a deckhand with the South African Navy during World War II. He then had a brief spell as an accountant, before finding his vocation in the dramatic arts. After some work in local repertory companies, he went to England on a one-way ticket in 1948, acting for four and a half years on stage in Southend-on-Sea, followed by a comedy act in the variety halls. Since this amounted to little more than a meager income, Johns was forced to make ends meet by doing handyman jobs, building fences, painting and gardening. His big break came in 1962, when he was presented with the choice of whether to accept a small part in the epic blockbuster Cleopatra (1963), or, alternatively, screen test for a new BBC police series (initially called \"Crime Cars\"). Though tempted by the gentler Roman climate, he wisely chose the latter. For better or worse, Johns became identified with Barlow to such an extent over the years, that he was even sought-after by police for recruitment drives on television. Conversely, though he occasionally attempted to break away from typecasting, especially on stage, he was rarely deemed to have succeeded.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg4MGY2YjQtMmMyYy00ZDRkLWJiZjEtM2I5YmU0MGFiMGFlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI2MDEwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424368","name":"Stratford Johns","idIMDB":"nm0424368"},"actorId":"nm0424368","character":"Harry Pinto","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Norman Eshley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0260596","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 May 1945","placeOfBirth":" Bristol, England, UK","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Norman Eshley was born on May 30, 1945 in Bristol, England.

As a young boy he attended Hillgrove school in Bangor and also went to school across the Menai Straits in nearby Anglesey. He later moved to London and after leaving Mortlake Secondary Modern School, he enrolled at The Corona Academy stage school in Chiswick. Former graduates of the Academy include Jeremy Bulloch, Richard O'Sullivan, Dennis Waterman and Frazer Hines. His first role as an actor was at the Theatre Royal, Windsor playing the part of 'Harlen' one of the seven boys in the play 'Life With Father', based on the humorous autobiographical book of stories written in 1936 by the American author Clarence Day, Jr. He is best remembered for the part as one of the kids of class 5C, the cowardly 'mummy's boy' Frankie Abbott, in the popular London Weekend Television series 'Please Sir!' The series made him a household name starring alongside Deryck Guyler, Joan Sanderson and John Alderton, and his fellow pupils Peter Cleall (Eric Duffy), Peter Denyer (Dennis Dunstable) and the late actors Malcolm McPhee (Peter Craven) and Liz Gebhardt (Maureen Bullock). The series was based around a fictitious South London comprehensive Fenn Street school. It was first transmitted on 11th November 1968 and ran for four series consisting of 53 episodes. 'Please Sir' ended in 1972, but was followed by a spin-off series called 'The Fenn Street Gang' following the kids of 5C as they left school and looked for work. It ran for two series but never found the same popularity and was axed in 1973. The Fenn Street Gang was also made into a comic strip for the 70s children's magazine 'Look In'. He continued working in television, films, theatre and radio. In 1980 he appeared in the feature film version of the popular Thames television comedy George and Mildred with, Yootha Joyce, Brian Murphy and Stratford Johns. He slowly moved into writing, something he had dabbled in during his 'Fenn Street' days when he had penned some episodes for the series. He is also credited as a writer for the 80s sit-com 'Keep It In The Family'. David has written scripts for public and private sector organisations, writing theatre scripts for training purposes, dealing with issues such as bullying in the workplace, race, sexual orientation and disability. More recently in 2002 he had his first novel published a police comedy thriller titled 'Each Man Kills' by Gomer Press ISBN-10: 1843230828 In 2005 he created and wrote the first weekly UK internet soap 'Careless Talk' www.carelesstalksoap.btinternet.co.uk set in Tunbridge Wells. Although a work of fiction unlike other soaps, real characters make fleeting appearances in the storylines, and many of the locations in and around Tunbridge Wells are factual. He completed his autobiography in 2006 called 'Flashback - An Actor's Life' in which he candidly tells the story of life as a child actor, working with the likes of Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in one of the most prestigious post-war theatre tours. The autobiography spans almost five decades and his story covers everything from the pitfalls of working in live television to performing with hard drinking actors. David is divorced and has two grown up children.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057973","name":"David Barry","idIMDB":"nm0057973"},"actorId":"nm0057973","character":"Elvis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sue Bond","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0094049","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 May 1945","placeOfBirth":" Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, UK","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Sue Bond is a blonde British actress and singer best remembered for her appearances on Benny Hill's Show in the early 1970s. Born 9 May 1945, in Aylesbury, Sue's first film appearances were in the 8mm glamour/girlie films of George Harrison Marks in the late 1960s. These early softcore films included the bizarre \"Hot Teddy\" in which Sue has sex with a large cuddly teddy bear; \"First You See It\", features Sue as a naked fantasy woman who appears and disappears in the hero's bathroom, bedroom, dining room etc, while \"Coitus - An Experience in Motion and Emotion\", adopts a Pseudo sex education approach in order to show Sue and a male partner indulging in a variety of sexual positions, all of which are inter-cut with title cards offering advice to 'young married couples'. The 8mm films lead to a role in Marks' feature film The Nine Ages of Nakedness (1969) and other sex film roles including Bizarre (1970) and her only lead role in the The Yes Girls (1971). She was also an extra in Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) and has a 'blink and you'll miss her' appearance in Lindsay Shonteff's film The Bullet Machine (1970) - billed as 'Suzy Bond' - as a woman who appears to have gone shopping in her underwear. Sue appeared in The Benny Hill Show for three years between 1970 and 1973, making her one of the longest serving female cast members of the pre-Hill's Angels era. In the mid-seventies Sue began to get offered more character roles in sitcoms. She claimed (to Titbits magazine) in 1975, that her ambitions at the time were to be a Bond girl in a James Bond film and appear in Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters. Neither transpired, although she did appear in a Bradford theatre production of Jack and the Beanstalk with Charlie Drake the same year. Alongside of her acting Sue also had a second career as a singer, mainly on the Northern Club Circuit. Sue's last acting credit was in the short lived revival of Mind Your Language' in 1986, although she was still performing as a singer on the cabaret circuit into the early 1990s.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0094049","name":"Sue Bond","idIMDB":"nm0094049"},"actorId":"nm0094049","character":"Marlene","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicholas Bond-Owen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0094064","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 November 1968","placeOfBirth":" Ashford, Middlesex, England, UK","bio":"Nicholas Bond-Owen was born on November 13, 1968 in Ashford, Middlesex, England.

During the seventies he was Associate Director of Northgate Theatre and Associate Director of The Nottingham Playhouse. His television career began in the mid-fifties and although initially playing small parts, during the sixties he began to take on bigger roles, including the part of Detective Chief Inspector Lewis in the BBC's long-running Softly Softly (1966) series. He often played policemen but none more famous than DCI Frank Haskins in The Sweeney (1975), opposite John Thaw and Dennis Waterman, during the seventies, where he was an admirable foil to Thaw's brash, renegade Inspector Jack Regan. He was also a regular in other TV series such as The Nineteenth Hole (1989), You Must Be the Husband (1987) and Shelley (1979), all during the eighties, and No Job for a Lady (1990) opposite Penelope Keith in the nineties. He preferred acting on stage and in television so his film career was rather limited but he did have a decent role in The Odessa File (1974) in 1974. In his personal life, early on he was married to the actress Dilys Laye before it ended in divorce. After a short illness, Morgan died from cancer on December 5, 2009.
