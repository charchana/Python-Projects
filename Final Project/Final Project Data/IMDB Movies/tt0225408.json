A barrel is then introduced and the girl enters one end. As she makes her exit from the other she is transformed into a man. The man then jumps through a paper hoop, and as he lands on the other side is changed back into the girl. The girl is then placed upon a table, the table is removed, and, to the astonishment of all, she remains in her position, apparently resting in mid-air. Two benches are then introduced and chairs placed under them, a man occupying one and the girl the other. At a wave of the magician's wand the figures fade away. When they reappear the girl and the man have changed places. Wonderful magic.","simplePlot":"The magician appears upon the stage with an imp as his assistant.
