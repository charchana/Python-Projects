The son of a New York policeman, Remsen lived a colorful life before turning to acting. He made his film debut in 1959 and was busy before the cameras in both film and television. Five years later, however, a collapsing crane on the set of the TV series No Time for Sergeants (1964) broke his back and nearly killed him. He recuperated for months and was able to walk again with crutches, but he believed his acting career was ended. He became a casting director, eventually heading the casting department of Lorimar Productions. While casting the film Brewster McCloud (1970), he was given a role by director Robert Altman. Though he continued to work in casting with his wife and partner Barbara Dodd, he resumed his acting career, working in scores of films and television episodes, most of the time requiring only a cane to walk. He appeared in many of Altman's films and was a popular figure in the film industry for his generosity and his vivid story-telling. He died in his sleep at age 74 in 1999.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI1NDI0NDgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk5NzYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0719037","name":"Bert Remsen","idIMDB":"nm0719037"},"actorId":"nm0719037","character":"Captain David Buckman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Spielberg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0818578","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNzcwMzQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTExNTEz._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 March 1939","placeOfBirth":" Weslaco, Texas, USA","bio":"David Spielberg was born on March 6, 1939 in Weslaco, Texas, USA.

She got her big break co-starring with John Travolta in the iconic motion picture Saturday Night Fever (1977), she followed up as the star of the popular sitcom Angie (1979), and has been working steadily on stage, film and television ever since. After her mother took her to see the Broadway show \"Funny Girl\" for her 13th birthday, Donna realized that the stage held the key to her future; she set her sights on becoming an actress. Awarded a scholarship to study at New York's prestigious American Academy of Dramatic Arts, upon graduation she landed a featured role in the touring company of \"Ah Wilderness\", starring Barbara Bel Geddes and Richard Kiley. After the play's run, she resumed her studies in New York City with the legendary Lee Strasburg, and later in Los Angeles with renowned teacher Milton Katselas. Following the release of Saturday Night Fever (1977), and with the subsequent acclaim for her performance as Annette, Donna was nominated for \"Best Supporting Actress\" by the New York Film Critics Circle, among other accolades. For her role as Angie Falco, on the popular sitcom Angie (1979) with Robert Hays, she garnered a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite Actress in a Television Comedy\", and a Golden Globe Award nomination for \"Best Actress in a Comedy Series\". As a singer, Donna performed her successful cabaret act in New York City and Los Angeles; she also starred in productions of \"A...My Name is Alice\", \"Grease\", \"Guys & Dolls\", and the critically-acclaimed Wendy Wasserstein play \"Isn't It Romantic\". Donna made history with a groundbreaking role on All My Children (1970), as Dr. Lynn Carson, the first lesbian character on daytime television. The limited run won the actress accolades and a Media Award from AGLA for her sensitive, stereotype-smashing portrayal. Another guest appearance on General Hospital (1963) delighted her daytime fans as the quirky and controlling Gertrude Morgan. Donna starred on the fantasy sitcom Out of This World (1987) opposite the legendary voice of Burt Reynolds, and as Eileen Stevens, Shia LaBeouf's mother on Even Stevens (2000), for which she received three Emmy nominations. Donna is a constant presence in television and film, with guest-starring appearances on such series as NYPD Blue (1993), Nash Bridges (1996), Clueless (1996), The Sopranos (1999), Crossing Jordan (2001), Cold Case (2003), Body of Proof (2011), among many others. Films include Jake Speed (1986) with John Hurt, Sale temps pour les maris (1998) with John Ritter, the HBO miniseries Glory Years (1987), the period drama The Day the Bubble Burst (1982), and Hallmark's Operation Cupcake (2012), not to mention several. Donna has worked as a director as well an actress. Along with several theatre projects in Los Angeles and regionally, she has been behind the camera on the television series Harry and the Hendersons (1991), Even Stevens (2000) and That's So Raven (2003). Donna currently resides in Los Angeles with her husband Arnold Zelonka and their son Jake Casey Zelonka.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMDg4ODA5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDcwMzg5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0675950","name":"Donna Pescow","idIMDB":"nm0675950"},"actorId":"nm0675950","character":"Sissy Owens","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jill Jacobson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0414865","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNTkwNjk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc3MTI0Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Jill Jacobson is an actress and producer, known for Falcon Crest (1981), Boredom (2015) and Mic Whore (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNTkwNjk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc3MTI0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0414865","name":"Jill Jacobson","idIMDB":"nm0414865"},"actorId":"nm0414865","character":"Annie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Milford","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587333","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRjYjZlNGMtZjM0Yy00OTIyLTg5NjctMzgwODFkMjUzZDM1L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA4NDY2Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR8,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 September 1927","placeOfBirth":" Johnstown, New York, USA","birthName":"John Hackney Milford","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"John Milford was born on September 7, 1927 in Johnstown, New York, USA as John Hackney Milford.
