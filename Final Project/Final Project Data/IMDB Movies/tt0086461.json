Pam has been a major African-American star from the early 1970s. Her career started in 1971, when Roger Corman of New World Pictures launched her with The Big Doll House (1971), about a women's penitentiary, and The Big Bird Cage (1972). Her strong role put her into a five-year contract with Samuel Z. Arkoff of American-International Pictures, and she became a leading lady in action films such as Jack Hill's Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974), the comic strip character Friday Foster (1975) and William Girdler's 'Sheba, Baby' (1975). She continued working with American-International, where she portrayed William Marshall's vampire victim in the Blacula (1972) sequel, Scream Blacula Scream (1973). During the 1980s she became a regular on Miami Vice (1984) and played a supporting role as an evil witch in Ray Bradbury's and Walt Disney Pictures' Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983), then returned to action as Steven Seagal's partner in Above the Law (1988). Her most famous role of the 1990s was probably Jackie Brown (1997), directed by Quentin Tarantino, which was an homage to her earlier 1970s action roles, She occasionally did supporting roles, as in Tim Burton's Mars Attacks! (1996), In Too Deep (1999) and a funny performance in Jawbreaker (1999). She also appeared in John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars (2001) and co-starred with Snoop Dogg in Bones (2001). Her entire career of over 30 years has brought only success for this beautiful and talented actress. A sister of Grier's died from cancer in 1990 and the son of that sister committed suicide because of his mother's illness. Pam herself was diagnosed with cancer in 1988 and given 18 months to live, which has had an effect on how she has chosen to live. She has never been wed, although she has been romantically linked to Richard Pryor and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the past.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNDEwNDA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY1NjgyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000427","name":"Pam Grier","idIMDB":"nm0000427"},"actorId":"nm0000427","character":"Myra","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0430129","main":true},{"actorName":"Warren Oates","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643105","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDUwMDkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3NDcyNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 July 1928","placeOfBirth":" Depoy, Kentucky, USA","birthName":"Warren Mercer Oates","height":"5' 11¼\" (1.81 m)","bio":"Warren Oates was an American character actor of the 1960s and 1970s and early 1980s whose distinctive style and intensity brought him to offbeat leading roles. Oates was born in Depoy, a very small Kentucky town. He was the son of Sarah Alice (Mercer) and Bayless Earle Oates, a general store owner. He attended high school in Louisville, continuing on to the University of Louisville and military service with the U.S. Marines. In college he became interested in the theatre and in 1954 headed for New York to make his mark as an actor. However, his first real job in television was, as it had been for James Dean before him, testing the contest gags on the game show Beat the Clock (1950). He did numerous menial jobs while auditioning, including serving as the hat-check man at the nightclub \"21\". By 1957 he had begun appearing in live dramas such as Studio One in Hollywood (1948), but Oates' rural drawl seemed more fitted for the Westerns that were proliferating on the big screen at the time, so he moved to Hollywood and immediately stared getting steady work as an increasingly prominent supporting player, often as either craven or vicious types. With his role as one of the Hammond brothers in the Sam Peckinpah masterpiece Ride the High Country (1962), Oates found a niche both as an actor and as a colleague of one of the most distinguished and distinctive directors of the period. Peckinpah used Oates repeatedly, and Oates, in large part due to the prominence given him by Peckinpah, became one of those rare character actors whose name and face is as familiar as those of many leading stars. He began to play roles which, while still character parts, were also leads, particularly in cult hits like Two-Lane Blacktop (1971) and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974). Although never destined to be a traditional leading man, Oates remained one of Hollywood's most valued and in-demand character players up until his sudden death from a heart attack on April 3, 1982 at the age of 53. His final two films, Tough Enough (1983) (filmed in late 1981) and Blue Thunder (1983) (filmed in early 1980), were released over one year after his death and were dedicated to his memory.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDUwMDkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3NDcyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643105","name":"Warren Oates","idIMDB":"nm0643105"},"actorId":"nm0643105","character":"James Neese","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0430131","main":true},{"actorName":"Bruce McGill","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0569226","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NDk0MDY2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA3MTU0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 July 1950","placeOfBirth":" San Antonio, Texas, USA","birthName":"Bruce Travis McGill","height":"5' 9¼\" (1.76 m)","bio":"Bruce McGill grew up in San Antonio, Texas where he began his acting career in in the MacArthur High School department of theatre.

Ryan's similarity to actress Marjorie Main was soon noticed in the late 1960s, and she frequently played tough, mean-lipped, earthy and gruff-but-lovable female characters. One of Ryan's first major television roles was playing Aggie Thompson, the housekeeper on The Doris Day Show (1968) and quickly found her place as a last-minute replacement on several television shows. She replaced the late Barbara Pepper in playing Doris Ziffel on the final season of Green Acres (1965). She also successfully succeeded Amanda Blake to play Miss Hannah on the final season of Gunsmoke (1955). Ryan's best-known TV credits include General Hospital (1963) and No Soap, Radio (1982). Ryan also had supporting roles in major motion pictures including Big Wednesday (1978), The Long Riders (1980), Stripes (1981), Savannah Smiles (1982), Private School (1983), Eyes of Fire (1983) and Pale Rider (1985). Although she was never far from television, she returned to play Hannah the Barbarian in the short lived animated series Little Dracula (1991). Fran Ryan passed away at her home in Burbank, California on January 15, 2000 of natural causes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTU0NTUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE1MTE3OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0752539","name":"Fran Ryan","idIMDB":"nm0752539"},"actorId":"nm0752539","character":"Gert Long","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0430133","main":true},{"actorName":"Christopher Norris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1433744","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Christopher Norris is an actor, known for Tough Enough (1983).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1433744","name":"Christopher Norris","idIMDB":"nm1433744"},"actorId":"nm1433744","character":"Christopher Long","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0430135","main":true},{"actorName":"Terra Perry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0675324","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Terra Perry is an actress, known for Tough Enough (1983).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0675324","name":"Terra Perry","idIMDB":"nm0675324"},"actorId":"nm0675324","character":"Wet T-Shirt Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0430134","main":true},{"actorName":"Big John Hamilton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0357749","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 October 1916","placeOfBirth":" Asheville, North Carolina, USA","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Big John Hamilton was born on October 29, 1916 in Asheville, North Carolina, USA.
