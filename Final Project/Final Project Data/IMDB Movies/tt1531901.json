At 12, he was cast as the role of the mailman in Negerkys og labre larver (1987), and later that year, he acted as a classmate in Bille August's film Pelle the Conqueror (1987), which, in 1988, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1989, he played the lead role in the \"The Neverending Story\" by Michael Ende in Roskilde, Denmark. But it was a children's play. After the few small roles Thure had played, he realized that he wanted to become a real actor. Lindhardt graduated from Odense Theatre School in 1998. In 1999, Thure was named recipient of the Reumert Award for Best New Talent. He had roles in two TV productions showing the year 2000, Denmarks Radios Edderkoppen (2000) a TV series where he played the poor boy Billy and in the Lars von Trier-produced family saga Morten Korch - Ved stillebækken (1999). His first notable role was that of Brian in A Place Nearby (2000), directed by Kaspar Rostrup, written by the novel of the same name of 'Martha Christensen' and produced by Tina Dalhoff. The film featured in the official selection at the 50th Berlin Film Festival. He played the lead as an autistic boy who is suspected of murder, and he received rave reviews for his performance and was named Shooting Star at the festival. This was followed by Shaky González's film One Hell of a Christmas (2002) where he played the part as the young cool criminal Mike. Later in the year 2002, he got the offer to play Slim in the Ballerin brothers' very special modern film Slim Slam Slum (2002). But the film really tested very poorly with the young audiences, and it became a Danish, bottom-10 comedy film. But in 2004, he did an outstanding job in the role of Hans in the German movie Love in Thoughts (2004)--the latter of which brought him to the public's attention. He is now one of the most critically acclaimed actors of his generation and portrays the weird junkie boy Steso in Ole Christian Madsen's fantastic film Angels in Fast Motion (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM1MjMyNDE4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTMwMTQzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511892","name":"Thure Lindhardt","nicknames":["Steso","Thøger"],"idIMDB":"nm0511892"},"actorId":"nm0511892","character":"Werner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jenny Kavanagh","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2265324","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jenny Kavanagh is an actress, known for Byzantium (2012), Fair City (1989) and My Happiness (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2265324","name":"Jenny Kavanagh","idIMDB":"nm2265324"},"actorId":"nm2265324","character":"Barmaid","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Glenn Doherty","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230572","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Glenn Doherty is an actor and writer, known for Byzantium (2012), Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) and Ripple (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230572","name":"Glenn Doherty","idIMDB":"nm0230572"},"actorId":"nm0230572","character":"Steve","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Edyta Budnik","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3217612","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzOTIzMTgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM2OTc4OTE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Edyta Budnik is an actress, known for The Tunnel (2013), The Bletchley Circle (2012) and Suspects (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzOTIzMTgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM2OTc4OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3217612","name":"Edyta Budnik","idIMDB":"nm3217612"},"actorId":"nm3217612","character":"Nadia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gabriela Marcinková","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4387549","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MzU0MDQ1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMzMTE5Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 April 1988","placeOfBirth":" Presov, Czechoslovakia [now Slovakia]","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Gabriela Marcinková was born on April 2, 1988 in Presov, Czechoslovakia.
