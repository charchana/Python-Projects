A high-ranking Nazi officer developed a plan to assassinate the three world leaders in order to undermine the Allied forces. He commissioned the German agent Max Richard (Armen Dzhigarkhanian) to carry out his plan, but it failed miserably due to the quick action and thinking of Andrei. While in Teheran, Andrei met a French woman, Marie Louni (Natalia Belokhvostikova), living in the city and they had a brief but intense affair. Nearly four decades later, the Nazi officer has been captured - but not for long. Freed by terrorists, the officer is hunting down the German agent who failed to carry out the planned assassinations.

He was born Curd Gustav Andreas Gottlieb Franz Jürgens on December 13, 1915, in Solln, Bavaria, in Hohenzollern Imperial Germany, a subject of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Of Franco-German parentage, Jürgens -- who was born during the closing days of the second year of the First World War -- would abandon the country of his birth after the end of World War II: Jürgens became an Austrian citizen in 1945 and lived part-time in France. Jürgens entered the journalism profession after receiving his education, and married Louise Basler, an actress. Basler, the first of his five wives, encouraged him to switch careers and become an actor. He learned his new profession on the Vienna stage, which retained his loyalty even after he became an global film star. Jürgens was sent to a concentration camp for \"political unreliables\" in 1944, due to his anti-Nazi opinions. It was this experience in Nazi Germany that led him to become an Austrian citizen after the war. His appearance in The Devil's General (1955) (\"The Devil's General\" (1955)), established him as a star of German cinema, and his role as Brigitte Bardot's older lover in Roger Vadim's ...And God Created Woman (1956) (And God Created Woman (1956)) made him an international star. Always interested in multilingual European actors with good looks and talent, Hollywood beckoned the 6' 4\" Jürgens, casting him in The Enemy Below (1957) as a WWII German U-boat commander in a duel with American destroyer commander Robert Mitchum. He constantly was in demand to play Germany military officers (e.g., The Longest Day (1962), the most expensive black-and-white film ever made) -- indeed, his last role was as \"The General\" in the miniseries Smiley's People (1982) -- and Germanic villains (e.g., \"Cornelius\", the cowardly and treacherous trading company representative, in Lord Jim (1965)) for the rest of his life. One of his most famous roles in the English-language cinema was as the James Bond villain, \"Karl Stromberg\", in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977); it was Moore's favorite Bond film. Jürgens considered himself primarily a stage actor and often performed on the Vienna stage. Though the world knew him as a cinema actor, he also directed several films and wrote several screenplays and an autobiography, \"Sixty and Not Yet Wise\" (1975). His death from a heart attack in 1982 in Vienna was front-page news across Austria and Germany.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg1MTYyODMwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI2NDExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432007","name":"Curd Jürgens","nicknames":["The Norman hulk"],"idIMDB":"nm0432007"},"actorId":"nm0432007","character":"Maître Legraine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Igor Kostolevskiy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0467486","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2IxYmVhNGQtZDU1Yi00ZTI0LWFlZTctZTkyMGJmNjJmM2QzL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY0Njk3ODk@._V1_UY44_CR14,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 September 1948","placeOfBirth":" Moscow, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]","birthName":"Igor Matveyevich Kostolevsky","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Igor Matveevich Kostolevsky was born in the family of the \"Eksportles\" of the Ministry of Foreign Trade director, Matvey Matveevich Kostolevsky and Vitta Semyonovna Kostolevskaya.

His father was of French and Corsican Italian descent, and his mother was of French and German ancestry. His parents divorced early on, and Delon had a stormy childhood, being frequently expelled from school. In 1953/1954 he served with the French Marines in Indochina. In the mid-'50s he worked at various odd jobs including waiter, salesman and porter in Les Halles market. He decided to try an acting career and in 1957 made his film debut in Yves Allégret's Send a Woman When the Devil Fails (1957). He declined an offer of a contract from producer David O. Selznick, and in 1960 he received international recognition for his role in Luchino Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers (1960). In 1961 he appeared on the stage in \"'Tis a Pity She's a Whore\", directed by Visconti, in Paris. In 1964 he formed his own production company, Delbeau Productions, and he produced a short film directed by Guy Gilles. In 1968 he found himself involved in murder, drug and sex scandal that indirectly implicated major politicians and show-business personalities, but he was eventually cleared of all charges. In the late 1960s he formed another company. Adel Film, and the next year he began producing features. In 1981 he directed his first film, Pour la peau d'un flic (1981). Delon was a sensation early in his career; he came to embody the young, energetic, often morally corrupted man. With his breathtaking good looks he was also destined to play tender lovers and romantic heroes, and he was a French embodiment of the type created in America by James Dean. His first outstanding success came with the role of the parasite Tom Ripley in 'Rene Clement''s sun-drenched thriller Purple Noon (1960). Delon presented a psychological portrait of a murderous young cynic who attempts to take on the identity of his victim. A totally different role was offered to him by Visconti in Rocco and His Brothers (1960). In this film Delon plays the devoted Rocco, who accepts the greatest sacrifices to save his shiftless brother Simon. After several other films in Italy, Delon returned to the criminal genre with Jean Gabin in Any Number Can Win (1963). This work, a classic example of the genre, was distinguished not only by a soundly worked-out screenplay, but also by the careful production and the excellent performances of both Delon and Gabin. It was only in the late 1960s that the sleek and lethal Delon came to epitomize the calm, psychopathic hoodlum, staring into the camera like a cat assessing a mouse. His tough, ruthless side was first used to real effect by Jean-Pierre Melville in Le Samouraï (1967). In 1970 he had a huge success in the bloodstained Borsalino (1970)--which he also produced--playing a small-time gangster in the 1930s who, with Jean-Paul Belmondo, becomes king of the Marseilles underworld. Delon later won critical acclaim for his roles, against type, in Joseph Losey's Mr. Klein (1976) in which he played (brilliantly) the icily sinister title role, and the art-movie Swann in Love (1984). He has an older son Anthony Delon (who has also acted in a number of movies) from his first marriage to Nathalie Delon, and has a young son and daughter, Alain-Fabien and Anouchka with Rosalie.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MDI2MDY3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDg5ODM0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001128","name":"Alain Delon","idIMDB":"nm0001128"},"actorId":"nm0001128","character":"Inspector Georges Roche","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nikolay Grinko","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342458","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 May 1920","placeOfBirth":" Kherson, Ukrainian SSR [now Ukraine]","birthName":"Nikolai Grigoryevich Grinko","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Nikolay Grinko was born on May 22, 1920 in Kherson, Ukrainian SSR [now Ukraine] as Nikolai Grigoryevich Grinko.

Adored by French and (unfortunately) by campy Italian directors, he was in more than ninety movies and appeared twenty-odd times on French television. He could have made it in art film thanks to his wonderful performance as the tramp in Eric Rohmer's \"Le Signe du Lion\" but was ignored by other \"serious-minded\" directors. On the contrary, and oddly enough to be sure, the quality of the film he was in declined dramatically after 1966, which was not doing justice to his wonderful screen presence. He also acted in ten theater plays. Whatever the case, the public loved him, although not knowing his name. In the mid seventies, a bit disappointed with his career, he preferred working on his farm near Dinan in Brittany, acting only occasionally. He died in Saint Malo hospital, forgotten by the film profession but not by TV or DVD viewers who still nowadays worship Nénesse from \"Les grandes Gueules\" or \"La Douceur\" (quite a misnomer!) from\"Cartouche\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI2YjIwNGYtZTY2Zi00NjhmLWI2MTItOWFmMzUwNjY3YTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0353916","name":"Jess Hahn","idIMDB":"nm0353916"},"actorId":"nm0353916","character":"Second Terrorist","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacques Roux","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746208","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1917","placeOfBirth":" France","bio":"Jacques Roux was born in 1917 in France.
