He won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in The Deer Hunter (1978), and has been seen in mostly supporting roles, often portraying psychologically unstable characters, though that generalization would not do justice to Walken's depth and breadth of performances. Walken was born in Astoria, Queens, to Rosalie (Russell), a Scottish immigrant, and Paul Walken, a German immigrant who ran Walken's Bakery. He learnt his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University & ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\". Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in Me and My Brother (1969), before appearing alongside Sean Connery in the sleeper heist movie The Anderson Tapes (1971). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of Diane Keaton suicidal younger brother in Annie Hall (1977), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying The Deer Hunter (1978). Walken was lured back by The Deer Hunter (1978) director Michael Cimino for a role in the financially disastrous western Heaven's Gate (1980), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in Pennies from Heaven (1981), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the Stephen King inspired The Dead Zone (1983) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure A View to a Kill (1985). Looking at many of Walken's other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in Biloxi Blues (1988), Wayne's World 2 (1993), Joe Dirt (2001), Mousehunt (1997) and America's Sweethearts (2001). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4ODUyNDQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODk2MTYz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000686","name":"Christopher Walken","nicknames":["Chris","Ronnie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000686"},"actorId":"nm0000686","character":"Peina","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0110446","main":true},{"actorName":"Annabella Sciorra","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001711","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0ODY5MzQ5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTY5MzA0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 March 1960","placeOfBirth":" Wethersfield, Connecticut, USA","birthName":"Annabella Gloria Philomena Sciorra","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Annabella Sciorra was born on March 29, 1960 in Wethersfield, Connecticut, USA as Annabella Gloria Philomena Sciorra.

She is of Italian (father) and Swedish, English, and Cornish (mother) descent. Edie grew up on Long Island and attended SUNY Purchase, where she was trained in acting at the prestigious Conservatory of Theatre Arts and Film. She moved to Manhattan after graduation, auditioning for roles and supporting herself as best she could; for example, working parties for an entertainment company where she would wear a Cookie Monster costume and urge people to get on the dance floor. Falco began getting film roles, mostly smaller supporting parts, starting in the late 1980s. Her first notable role was a supporting part in Bullets Over Broadway (1994). Ironically, it was in television where the conservatory-trained Falco's career first flowered. She obtained her first recurring roles in 1993, on the acclaimed police dramas Homicide: Life on the Street (1993), as the wife of a blinded police officer, and Law & Order (1990) as a Legal Aid attorney. Next came a recurring role on the prison drama Oz (1997), as a sympathetic corrections officer. All the while she continued to work in film, still in small supporting roles. Supporting herself in acting continued to be a challenge until at last Falco found success in 1999, when she was cast in the HBO series The Sopranos (1999), as Carmela, the wife of New Jersey Mafia street boss Tony Soprano. \"The Sopranos\" gained her a great deal of visibility and praise for her exceptionally strong dramatic skills. In 2000 Falco became one of the few actresses in history to sweep all of the major television awards (the Emmy, the Golden Globe and the SAG Award) in one year for a dramatic role. She is also the first female actor ever to receive the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama. Interestingly, her roles have frequently put her on one side of the law or the other--a defense attorney, a corrections officer, a cop's wife, a mobster's wife, a police officer (in a pilot for a television adaptation of the movie Fargo (1996)). She has also worked frequently on the stage, such as her award-winning work in the play \"Sideman,\" in \"The Vagina Monologues,\" and in revivals of \"Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune\" (which was hugely successful) and \"'night Mother.\" Unlike her brashly assertive alter-ego Carmela Soprano, Falco is self-described as shy, but is clearly a witty and down-to-earth person. She sometimes travels with her beloved dog Marley, driving so that the dog does not have to travel in the baggage compartment. At one point Falco had a relationship with her \"Frankie and Johnny\" co-star Stanley Tucci. She was treated for breast cancer in 2004 and her prognosis is very good. In December 2004, Falco adopted a baby boy, whom she named Anderson, after her mother's surname. Another adoption, of a baby girl named Macy, followed in 2008.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDAzOTk4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ0MzQxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004908","name":"Edie Falco","nicknames":["Kitten"],"idIMDB":"nm0004908"},"actorId":"nm0004908","character":"Jean","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0473338","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Calderon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0129538","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY2NzY5MDI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIzNjMzMw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1959","placeOfBirth":" Puerto Rico","bio":"Paul Calderon was born in 1959 in Puerto Rico.

Vernon, New York on March 26, 1966. His film work began in the late 1980s. An early part that brought him recognition was in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), as Spider, a local kid who works for the gangsters and has a run-in with a psychopathic mob soldier played by Joe Pesci. He worked throughout the 1990s in the New York independent film industry, especially as a regular in Spike Lee's movies, appearing in Jungle Fever (1991), Malcolm X (1992), Clockers (1995), Girl 6 (1996) and Summer of Sam (1999), generally playing working-class Italian-Americans from the \"outer boroughs.\" While rooted in the New York movie scene, Imperioli also worked in Hollywood in the mid-'90s, in the formulaic movies Bad Boys (1995) and Last Man Standing (1996). In 1999, Imperioli was cast in The Sopranos (1999) as Christopher Moltisanti, a low-ranking soldier in the Soprano crime organization whose family connections to street boss Tony Soprano move him up the ladder in the organization. Imperioli's multi-layered portrayal of such an unappealing character is a real highlight of the series and earned him an Emmy and a SAG award. Imperioli has long been active in the New York theater scene as well, having written, directed, produced or starred in numerous plays. He was a founder, along with Lili Taylor (his then-girlfriend and co-star in Household Saints (1993)) of the downtown theater company Machine Full. He has also written several episodes of \"The Sopranos\" and was a writer on Lee's \"Summer of Sam,\" which he also executive-produced. Although most famous for his prominent part in \"The Sopranos,\" Imperioli has worked on other television programs as well, including Law & Order (1990), New York Undercover (1994) and NYPD Blue (1993). He is married and has two children and one stepdaughter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1Nzk2MDg2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk4NzQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0408284","name":"Michael Imperioli","idIMDB":"nm0408284"},"actorId":"nm0408284","character":"Missionary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jamal Simmons","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0799782","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jamal Simmons is an actor, known for Politics Nation with Al Sharpton (2011), The Addiction (1995) and Kids (1995).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0799782","name":"Jamal Simmons","nicknames":["Bruzer","Redrum"],"idIMDB":"nm0799782"},"actorId":"nm0799782","character":"Black's Friend","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert W.
