When he was 13 his parents divorced and he went with his mother to live in Chicago. He caught the acting bug while attending college, and began appearing in local stage productions. On first breaking into film, his intensity and \"don't-mess-with-me\" good looks were highlighted to chilling effect as the title character in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986), filmed in 1986 but, due to its controversial nature, not released until 1990. Since that widely noticed and highly praised performance, much of his career has been spent playing brutes, villains and psychopaths. His occasional turns as a \"good guy\", however, are always well-acted and a welcome change for a talented actor too often typecast.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNDI5MjQ5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjI1MTgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740264","name":"Michael Rooker","idIMDB":"nm0740264"},"actorId":"nm0740264","character":"Ray","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Blanche Baker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048273","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MDg0Mjk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkzNjk2NA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 December 1956","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Blanche Garfein","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Blanche Baker is an actress of stage, screen and television. Born Blanche Garfein in New York, her mother is actress Carroll Baker, who won a Best Actress Oscar nomination for Baby Doll (1956), several months after baby Blanche arrived. Her father is stage director Jack Garfein, who later went on to direct movies and teach acting. After attending Wellesley College, she took her mother's surname and made her television debut in the miniseries Holocaust (1978), for which she won an Emmy Award. Baker made her movie debut in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979), an A-List production featuring Alan Alda at the height of his popularity and another \"Holocaust\" co-star at the start of her career, Meryl Streep. She then appeared as the Holy Mother in the TV movie, Mary and Joseph: A Story of Faith (1979). Then came \"Lolita.\" In 1980-81, the 24-year-old Baker originated the role of the preteen \"nymphet\" loved by a pedophile in Edward Albee's stage adaption of Nabokov's classic novel. The show was picketed during out-of-town tryouts and in New York by feminists outraged by the show's depiction of pedophilia. More importantly, the show was pilloried by outraged critics in its out-of-town tryouts, giving \"Lolita\" a bad word of mouth. After 31 previews, the troubled production opened on Broadway on March 19, 1981 and closed after only 12 performances. She never appeared on Broadway again, despite critics calling her performance \"breathtaking\" and \"beguiling.\" Blanche Baker has continued to work steadily in television and on the silver screen but has never again approached the heights she did in her early twenties.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MDg0Mjk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkzNjk2NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048273","name":"Blanche Baker","idIMDB":"nm0048273"},"actorId":"nm0048273","character":"Helen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Benjamin Forster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2341280","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Benjamin Forster is an actor, known for Hypothermia (2010), Automatons (2006) and Satan Hates You (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2341280","name":"Benjamin Forster","idIMDB":"nm2341280"},"actorId":"nm2341280","character":"David","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Amy Chang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2684348","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk4ODMyMjQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDkyMzY5OTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Amy Chang is known for her work on Master of None (2015), Ace the Case (2016) and Hypothermia (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk4ODMyMjQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDkyMzY5OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2684348","name":"Amy Chang","idIMDB":"nm2684348"},"actorId":"nm2684348","character":"Gina","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Wood","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1332521","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzAwNDQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc1MjEzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Don Wood is an actor and writer, known for CanniBallistic!
