He was born on October 1, 1930, in Lille, Nord, France, into a middle class family of shopkeepers. His father was fond of literature. Young Noiret attended the College Janson-of-Sally in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. At school, he was more interested in acting than in academics; he failed to pass his baccalaureate exams three times and left school without graduation. He studied acting at the Centre Dramatique de l'Ouest (Western Drama Theatre). There, in 1950, Noiret made his debut sharing the stage with Gérard Philipe under directorship of Roger Blin. From 1953 - 1960 Noiret was a permanent member of the troupe with the Théâtre National Populaire (TNP) in Paris. There he played over 40 roles in seven years under directorship of Jean Vilar. While there he met actress Monique Chaumette, whom he married in 1962, and they had one daughter, Frederique. At that time Noiret continued his acting career as a stand-up comedian and a night club entertainer. Noiret made his big screen debut playing bit part in Gigi (1949), then earned his first on-screen credit in Agence matrimoniale (1952). He landed his first leading role as Lui, a government inspector, in the French New Wave film La Pointe Courte (1955) by notable female director Agnès Varda. His first big success came in 1960 with Louis Malle's film Zazie dans le métro (1960) (aka.. Zazie in the Metro). In 1968 he became a star in France with the title role in Alexandre le bienheureux (1968). After that success, Noiret moved on with his acting career and devoted himself almost entirely to the big screen. Noiret's trademark hangdog face and his range allowed him to portray a middle-class man or an aristocrat, but not a handsome romantic hero, so he was cast primarily as the Everyman character. In La Grande Bouffe (1973), an allegoric film about sex orgy and suicide by overeating, which caused a scandal at Cannes in 1973, Noiret co-starred in a controversial role as suicidal judge Philippe, alongside Marcello Mastroianni. Philippe Noiret shot to international fame with the supporting role as Alfredo, an old man who is a small town projectionist who befriends and inspires a young boy, in Cinema Paradiso (1988). He received international acclaim for his portrayal of the exiled Chilean poet Pablo Neruda in Il Postino: The Postman (1994) by director Michael Radford. Noiret won two Cesar Awards (the French equivalent of the Oscars) and earned three more Cesar nominations. In 1976 he won his first Cesar for his exceptional performance as Julien Dandieu, a surgeon who kills the Nazis in revenge for the death of his wife and daughter, in The Old Gun (1975) (aka.. The Old Gun). Noiret won his second Cesar for the leading role as Major Delaplane in La vie et rien d'autre (1989) (aka.. Life and Nothing But) in 1990. Over the years, Noiret worked with all of the France's top directors. He also made excellent radio performances and popular books readings, which he narrated with his serious voice and impeccable diction. He was decorated with the Knight of the Legion of Honor. Philippe Noiret was also known as an elegant hedonist and an avid dog lover. His other interests outside of the acting profession included art, horses, gourmet cuisine and cigars. For about 30 years he resided in his country house in the wine country near Carcassonne, in the South of France, where he generously supported the local causes. Noiret died of generalized complications of cancer on November 23, 2006, in a hospital, in Paris, and was laid to rest in Cimetière du Monparnasse in Paris, France.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MzE2OTE0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg2NzIwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634159","name":"Philippe Noiret","idIMDB":"nm0634159"},"actorId":"nm0634159","character":"Alexandre","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Françoise Brion","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0109725","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkYmQ3YzUtYjgxNi00MzdlLWIzNjUtYjY5MWVkNzE1MTdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 January 1933","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Françoise Alicia Rose German de Ribon","bio":"Françoise Brion was born on January 29, 1933 in Paris, France as Françoise Alicia Rose German de Ribon.

Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"Colibert","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean Saudray","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766551","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 July 1928","placeOfBirth":" Bordeaux, France","bio":"Jean Saudray was born on July 17, 1928 in Bordeaux, France.
