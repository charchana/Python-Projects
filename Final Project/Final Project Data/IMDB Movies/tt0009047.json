At the age of 5 she first appeared on the stage in the play \"Cameo Kirby\". From that time on she worked steadily without a single vacation. Her greatest stage success was in \"The Littlest Rebel\", with William Farnum and Dustin Farnum. In 1911, at the age of 9, a New York paper described her as \" . . . a ragged, straight-haired, woman-faced little one\". She continued on the stage until 1915, when she started her film career. She was being groomed as a Mary Pickford star - a child of innocence. Her early pictures carried this theme with such titles as Lovely Mary (1916), Faith (1916) and Dimples (1916). Mary was described by the press as \"of the screen as a sweet, pretty little girl with an abundance of blonde curls, a picture actress slightly bigger than a faint recollection, a little queen with delicate features and endearing young charms\". She later worked for Adolph Zukor at Realart Pictures and one of her favorite directors was William Desmond Taylor. While at Realart Mary made a number of films including Anne of Green Gables (1919), Judy of Rogue's Harbor (1920), Jenny Be Good (1920) and The Little Clown (1921). Her salary, which started at $150 per week in 1915, increased to $2250 per week. At that time she also became involved with Taylor, but it is not known whether Taylor was looking out for his biggest star or if there was any real romance. Then everything crumbled. On February 1, 1922, Taylor was shot to death in his Hollywood bungalow. His unsolved murder was one of Hollywood's major scandals, coming at the same time as the Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle incident. Though she was never considered a suspect in the murder, when the public learned of Mary's involvement with a man who had questionable dealings with women and was more than twice her age, they boycotted her films. The discovery of her belongings in Taylor's bungalow effectually killed her career in pictures. Mary was so weak from grief that she was barricaded in her home for a month. By the next year she had moved out of the home she shared with her mother and was out of pictures forever.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwOTY5NDQzMDdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDIyMTQzNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591704","name":"Mary Miles Minter","idIMDB":"nm0591704"},"actorId":"nm0591704","character":"Julia Deep","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Allan Forrest","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0286594","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 September 1885","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","birthName":"Allan Forrest Fisher","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Allan Forrest was born on September 1, 1885 in Brooklyn, New York, USA as Allan Forrest Fisher.
