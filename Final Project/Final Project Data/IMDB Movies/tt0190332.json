Chow was born in 1955 on the quiet island of Lamma, part of the then-British colony of Hong Kong, near its famous Victoria Harbour. His mother was a vegetable farmer and cleaning lady, and his father worked on a Shell Oil Company tanker. Chow's family moved to urban Hong Kong in 1965 and in early 1973, Chow attended a casting call for TVB, a division of Shaw Bros. productions. With his good looks and easy-going style, Chow was originally a heartthrob actor in non-demanding TV and film roles. However, his popularity increased with his appearance as white-suited gangster Hui Man-Keung in the highly popular drama TV series Shang Hai tan (1983). In 1985, Chow started receiving acclaim for his work and scored the Golden Horse (Best Actor) Award in Taiwan and another Best Actor Award from the Asian Pacific Film Festival for his performance in Hong Kong 1941 (1984). With these accolades, Chow came to the attention of Woo, who cast Chow in the fast-paced gangster film A Better Tomorrow (1986) (aka \"A Better Tomorrow\"). The rest, as they say, is history. The film was an enormous commercial success, and Chow's influence on young Asian males was not dissimilar to the adulation given to previous Asian film sensations such as Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. Nearly every young guy in Hong Kong ran out and bought himself a \"Mark Coat,\" as they became known--a long, heavy woolen coat worn by Chow in the movie (although it is is actually very unsuited to Hong Kong's hot and humid climate). Further hard-edged roles in more John Woo crime films escalated Chow's popularity even higher, and fans all over the world flocked to see A Better Tomorrow II (1987) (aka \"A Better Tomorrow 2\"), The Killer (1989) (aka \"The Killer\"), and Hard Boiled (1992) (aka \"Hard Boiled\"). With the phenomenal global interest in the HK action genre, Chow was enticed to the United States and appeared in The Replacement Killers (1998) with Mira Sorvino, The Corruptor (1999) with Mark Wahlberg, and, for a change of pace, in the often-filmed romantic tale of Anna and the King (1999). Chow then returned to the Asian cinema circuit and starred in the critically lauded kung fu epic Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) (aka \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"). His wide appeal can be seen in his \"boy next door\" type of personality and his ability to play such a broad spectrum of roles from a comedic buffoon to a lovestruck Romeo to a trigger-happy professional killer. A highly entertaining and gifted actor with dynamic on-screen presence, Chow continues to remain in strong demand in many film markets.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ODkzMDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODk0MzY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000334","name":"Yun-Fat Chow","nicknames":["Faat Tsai","Faat \"Gor\""],"idIMDB":"nm0000334"},"actorId":"nm0000334","character":"Master Li Mu Bai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004157","main":true},{"actorName":"Michelle Yeoh","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000706","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NTI0NDkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYwMTIwNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 August 1962","placeOfBirth":" Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia","birthName":"Yeoh Chu-Kheng","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Born as Yang Zi Qiong in the mining town of Ipoh, in West Malaysia, in the lunar year of the Tiger, Michelle is the daughter of Janet Yeoh and Yeoh Kian Teik, a lawyer and politician. She is of Han Chinese (Hokkien) descent, and spoke English and Malay before Chinese. A ballet dancer since age 4, she moved to London, England to study at the Royal Academy as a teenager. After a brief dance career, she won the Miss Malaysia beauty pageant title in her native country and the Miss Moomba beauty pageant title in Melbourne, Australia in the early 1980s. Her first on camera work was a 1984 commercial with martial arts star Jackie Chan. In 1985, she began making action movies with D&B Films of Hong Kong. She was first billed as Michelle Khan, then later, Michelle Yeoh. Never a trained martial artist, she relied on her dance discipline and her on-set trainers to prepare for her martial arts action scenes. She uses many dance moves in her films. She still does most of her own stunts and has been injured many times. Ironically, she still cannot read Chinese and she has to have Chinese script read to her. In 1988, she married wealthy D&B Films executive Dickson Poon and retired from acting. Even though they divorced in 1992, she is close to Poon's second wife and a godmother to Poon's daughter. When she returned to acting, she became very popular to Chinese audiences and she became known to western audiences through her co-starring roles in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and in the phenomenally successful Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) aka Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' directed by Ang Lee. She turned down a role in a sequel to The Matrix (1999). She has her own production company, Mythical Films and has trained with the Shen Yang Acrobatic team for her role in Le talisman (2002), an English language film she is both starring in and producing. She hopes to use her company to discover and nurture new film-making talent. She also wants to act in roles that combine both action and deeper spiritual themes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NTI0NDkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYwMTIwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000706","name":"Michelle Yeoh","idIMDB":"nm0000706"},"actorId":"nm0000706","character":"Yu Shu Lien","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004156","main":true},{"actorName":"Ziyi Zhang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955471","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk1NzY2ODAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE2NjExMDI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 February 1979","placeOfBirth":" Beijing, China","birthName":"Zhang Zi-Yi","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Ziyi Zhang was born on February 9, 1979 in Beijing, China as Zhang Zi-Yi.
