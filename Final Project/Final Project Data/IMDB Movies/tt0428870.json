This role launched his career as one of the most promising actors in Korea. He dropped out of high school and became a full-time actor, both for TV dramas and films. He did a couple of TV series and a film, but it was Biteu (1997) that really made him an icon.

He has a keen interest in filmmaking, and his dream is to run his own film company.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5OTQ4NDk1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3MDYyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432601","name":"Woo-sung Jung","idIMDB":"nm0432601"},"actorId":"nm0432601","character":"Cheol-su","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ye-jin Son","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1162030","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThkMDIwZDUtNTU3My00OTY3LWJlODgtNjE3YTJkYWUyYWU1L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIyNzU0OA@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 January 1982","placeOfBirth":" Daegu, South Korea","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"As of her debut in South Korean films, Ye-jin Son became one of the stars of Chungmoore, the Korean Hollywood, notably appearing in the beautiful \"Drunk on Women and Poetry\" by the master Kwan-taek Im.
