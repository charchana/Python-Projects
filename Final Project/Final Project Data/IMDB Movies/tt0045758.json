Four soldiers survive the crash-landing of their plane to find themselves in a forest six miles behind enemy lines. The group, led by Lt. Corby, has a plan: They'll make their way to a nearby river, build a raft, and then, under cover of night, float back to friendly territory. Their plans for getting back safely are sidetracked by a young woman who stumbles across them as they hide in the woods, and by the nearby presence of an enemy general who one member of the group is determined to kill.","simplePlot":"Four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines must confront their fears and desires.","actors":[{"actorName":"Frank Silvera","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0798826","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5MDQ1MTM0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE3MTQ2MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 July 1914","placeOfBirth":" Kingston, British West Indies [now Kingston, Jamaica]","birthName":"Frank Alvin Silvera","bio":"He was a highly successful black actor/director in the 1950s and 1960s who - because of his light-skinned appearance - transcended race and ethnicity in his performances.

He was actively engaged in the Civil Rights Struggles of the 1950s and 1960s and called on all of his associates in the theater and film world to support the efforts of Black Americans during this watershed in American history. The Frank Silvera Writers' Workshop Foundation, Inc. was founded by actor/ director Morgan Freeman, playwright/director Garland Lee Thompson, director/ actress Billie Allen and journalist Clayton Riley in 1973.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5MDQ1MTM0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE3MTQ2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0798826","name":"Frank Silvera","idIMDB":"nm0798826"},"actorId":"nm0798826","character":"Sgt.
