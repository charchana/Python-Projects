He played further comedic roles in Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984), and Beetlejuice (1988), earned further acclaim for his dramatic portrayal of Bruce Wayne / Batman in Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), and since then, has moved easily between film genres, ranging from drama and romantic comedy to thriller and action. Keaton was born Michael John Douglas on September 5, 1951 in Coraopolis, Pennsylvannia, to Leona Elizabeth (Loftus), a homemaker, and George A. Douglas, a civil engineer and surveyor. He is of Irish, as well as English, Scottish, and German, descent. Michael studied speech for two years at Kent State, before dropping out and moving to Pittsburgh. An unsuccessful attempt at stand-up comedy led Keaton to working as a TV cameraman in a cable station, and he came to realize he wanted to work in front of the cameras. Keaton first appeared on TV in several episodes of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968). He left Pittsburgh and moved to Los Angeles to begin auditioning for TV. He began cropping up in popular TV shows including Maude (1972) and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979). Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Night Shift (1982). Keaton next scored the lead in the comedy hits Mr. Mom (1983), Johnny Dangerously (1984) , Gung Ho (1986), the Tim Burton horror-comedy Beetlejuice (1988), and The Dream Team (1989). Keaton's career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero, millionaire playboy / crime-fighter Bruce Wayne, in Batman (1989). Burton cast him because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character demands. To say there were howls of protest by fans of the caped crusader comic strip is an understatement! Warner Bros. was deluged with thousands of letters of complaint commenting that comedian Keaton was the wrong choice for the Caped Crusader, given his prior work and the fact that he lacked the suave, handsome features and tall, muscular physicality often attributed to the character in the comic books. However, their fears were proven wrong when Keaton turned in a sensational performance, and he held his own on screen with opponent Jack Nicholson, playing the lunatic villain, \"The Joker\". Keaton's dramatic work earned widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and Batman (1989) became one of the most successful films of the year. Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films. Keen to diversify his work, Keaton starred as a psychotic tenant in Pacific Heights (1990), as a hard-working cop in One Good Cop (1991), and then donned the black cape and cowl once more for Batman Returns (1992). He remained in demand during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including the star-studded Shakespearian Much Ado About Nothing (1993), the drama My Life (1993), another Ron Howard comedy The Paper (1994), with sexy Andie MacDowell in Multiplicity (1996), twice in the same role, dogged Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in Jackie Brown (1997) and Out of Sight (1998). He also played a killer in the mediocre thriller Desperate Measures (1998). In the 2000s, Keaton appeared in several productions with mixed success, including Live from Baghdad (2002), First Daughter (2004), and Herbie Fully Loaded (2005). He also provided voices for characters in the animated films Cars (2006), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Minions (2015). He returned to major film roles in the 2010s, co-starring in The Other Guys (2010), RoboCop (2014) and Need for Speed (2014). Also that year, Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014), a film by 21 Grams (2003) and Biutiful (2010) director Alejandro González Iñárritu. In the film, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the iconic titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story, to regain his former glory. Keaton's critically praised lead performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy, and nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2015, he played a journalist in Spotlight (2015), which, like Birdman, won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2016, he starred as Ray Kroc, the developer of McDonald's, in the drama The Founder (2016). He is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NTE2MzczOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM4MjYz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474","name":"Michael Keaton","nicknames":["Michael Douglas"],"idIMDB":"nm0000474"},"actorId":"nm0000474","character":"Jonathan Rivers","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013751","main":true},{"actorName":"Chandra West","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0921979","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI1OGMxMzktODViNC00MjZjLWJhN2MtZTFmYmMzMzE2NTZlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3NTE5MDc@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 December 1970","placeOfBirth":" Edmonton, Alberta, Canada","birthName":"Chandra K.

As an actor, his screen presence has a far different kind of impact than the kind he used to deliver as a professional athlete -- Both are hard-hitting and memorable. Dopud was born in Montreal, Canada, the second son of a Yugoslavian family. Mike speaks three languages fluently (English, French, and Serbian). Graduating with a degree in Physiology and International Business Administration from Southern Illinois University where he was a four-year letterman, Dopud went on to a pro-football career in the Canadian Football League that was cut short by a knee injury. After rehabilitating his knee, he found himself back on skates playing pro hockey in the Minor Leagues. Plagued by injury, his sports career ended abruptly. It wasn't long after Dopud had his first taste of the film industry on the hit television series The X-Files (1993). \"I was hooked.\" Dopud's talent, rugged good looks, and screen presence has also caught the attention of casting directors. His forty acting credits over the last few years has made this working actor someone to watch for and someone who is hard to miss. In the soon-to-be released King Rising - Au nom du Roi (2007), Dopud plays General Backler. Some of Dopud's other recent film credits include 300 (2006), White Noise (2005), BloodRayne (2005), Rollerball (2002), I Spy (2002), X-Men 2 (2003), I, Robot (2004), and Canada Russia '72 (2006). Dopud has had recurring roles on such shows as Smallville (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004), Jeff Ltd. (2005), Stargate SG-1 (1997), and Millennium (1996). This fall, Mike can be seen on MTV playing the role of Don Harris on the new series Kaya (2007). His size and professional sports background landed Dopud regular stunt work while he steadily began building his acting resume. His \"day at the office\" in stunt work has included being set on fire, hit by a car, falling off buildings thrown through windows and down stairs, flying through walls, and more fight scenes than Mike Tyson has fought professional bouts. He's duked it out with Dwayne Johnson (Walking Tall (2004)), Jason Statham (Chaos (2005)), Vin Diesel (The Chronicles of Riddick (2004)), Jessica Alba (Dark Angel), Lucy Liu (Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002)), Jean-Claude Van Damme (Replicant (2001)), and the Charlestown Chiefs in the sequel to the cult classic One More Minute (1979): Slap Shot 2: Breaking the Ice (2002). Most recently Dopud has been nominated for a 2005 Taurus World Stunt Awards for Best High Work in the movie Walking Tall (2004). Dopud is also excited that he has returned to the stage most recently in the original plays: Rockets Red Glare and Of Diners and Buses. And Two Small Bodies. Gingham Dog.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzOTgwOTAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAwNTM4Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233304","name":"Mike Dopud","idIMDB":"nm0233304"},"actorId":"nm0233304","character":"Detective Smits","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marsha Regis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1356311","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MjI2Mjg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU5MTYzNTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Marsha Regis is an actress, known for Watchmen (2009), White Noise (2005) and The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MjI2Mjg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU5MTYzNTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1356311","name":"Marsha Regis","idIMDB":"nm1356311"},"actorId":"nm1356311","character":"Police Woman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brad Sihvon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797638","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 January 1971","placeOfBirth":" Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Bradley Daniel Sihvon","bio":"Brad Sihvon was born on January 29, 1971 in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada as Bradley Daniel Sihvon.
