He moved with his family to Lemington, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England in 1972 at the age of eight, and later to Cramlington, Northumberland, where he was raised. As a child, he dreamed to become an actor, but he also thought that dream was impossible. So he pursued his other love, art, and went to art school instead. He was an interior designer with an architectural firm in London when he at 25 decided to try out acting. Eventually he attended Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, graduating at the age of 29. At the beginning of 90s, he began his career on films. He did a few TV films, one of them is The Return of the Native (1994), where he appeared opposite Clive Owen, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Steven Mackintosh. He also filmed The Theory of Flight (1998) Greenwich Mean Time (1999), Green-Eyed Monster (2001) (TV) and a lot of TV guest roles in series. Finally, he made a international breakout with King Arthur (2004), as quiet, but loyal knight Dagonet, again with Clive Owen (who played Arthur), Keira Knightley, Ioan Gruffudd, Mads Mikkelsen, Ray Winstone and Stellan Skarsgard. After a few more TV films, Stevenson's popularity started to rise by each film. But, his real fame came with HBO's \"Rome\" (2005 - 2007), as funny, but heroically fearless legionary Titus Pullo, opposite Kevin McKidd. Another two well-known roles were in the action horror Outpost (2008) and as comic book dark hero The Punisher / Frank Castle in the extremely violent Punisher: War Zone (2008), opposite Dominic West (Jigsaw), Doug Hutchison, Colin Salmon, Wayne Knight (Microchip), Dash Mihok (Det.

At the age of 20, Josh landed his first professional job as an actor with the acclaimed Royal Shakespeare Company. He then went on to perform with some of the most renowned theater companies in the world, including the Royal National Theatre, The English National Opera, The New Shakespeare Company, The Young Vic, to name a few. Never leaving Theatre far behind, Josh began landing parts in Television and Independent Films. Missing the USA after spending ten years in London, Josh made the move back stateside and landed in Hollywood. Five days after being back in the states, Josh got the call that he was being offered the leading role of \"Fandral\" in 2011's blockbuster, Thor (2011), by Marvel Studios, directed by the Oscar-nominated director/actor Kenneth Branagh.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNzEwNzIyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMwMTU1OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2796047","name":"Josh Dallas","idIMDB":"nm2796047"},"actorId":"nm2796047","character":"Fandral","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0127923","main":true},{"actorName":"Jaimie Alexander","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1526352","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzAzMzQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU3OTA2MDE@._V1_UY44_CR18,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 March 1984","placeOfBirth":" Greenville, South Carolina, USA","birthName":"Jaimie Lauren Tarbush","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Jaimie Alexander was born in Greenville, South Carolina, but moved with her family to Grapevine, Texas, when she was four years old. She took theatre classes in grade school as a hobby but was kicked out in high school because she could not sing, and so she took up sports instead. At age 17 she substituted for a friend at a meeting with a scouting agency and she met her manager, Randy James, who sent her some scripts. After graduating from high school she moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue acting. Her career was launched in 2003 when she was cast in the leading role of Hanna Thompson in the low-budget award-winning film The Other Side (2006). According to the DVD commentary, she was originally at the audition to help out by reading against the male actors, but director Gregg Bishop decided to cast her in the leading role after hearing her perform the lines. Her second role was in 2004 in Squirrel Trap (2004), in which she played the co-lead role of Sara. A year later she was cast as Jessi XX on the ABC Family series Kyle XY (2006), in which she played the role of a superhuman being created by scientists as a laboratory experiment. She was nominated for the Saturn Awards as \"Best Supporting Actress on Television\" for that role in 2008. Her biggest role came in 2011, when she was cast as Lady Sif, a warrior goddess of Asgard, in the blockbuster from Marvel Comics, Thor (2011). She later reprised her role in its sequel, Thor: The Dark World (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzAzMzQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU3OTA2MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1526352","name":"Jaimie Alexander","nicknames":["James"],"idIMDB":"nm1526352"},"actorId":"nm1526352","character":"Sif","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0062967","main":true},{"actorName":"Rene Russo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000623","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDI4MDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzI3NjE0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1954","placeOfBirth":" Burbank, California, USA","birthName":"Rene Marie Russo","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Rene Russo was born in Burbank, California, to Shirley (Balocca), a barmaid and factory laborer, and Nino Russo. She grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. Her father, a sculptor and mechanic, left the family when Rene was just two, and thus her mother raised Rene and her sister, Toni, as a single mom. Her father was of Italian descent, and her mother was of Italian and German-English-Irish ancestry. In junior high school, Rene was plagued with scoliosis and had to wear a full-torso brace. She was already a tall girl, which earned her the nickname \"Jolly Green Giant\" from her classmates. She entered Burroughs High School, along with classmate Ron Howard, and even though her brace had been removed, she was still somewhat of a loner. Unable to deal with academics and the school social scene, Rene dropped out of school in the tenth grade. Since money was tight, she began to take a variety of part-time jobs over the next 18 months, many for the free benefits. She sold refreshments at a movie theater, where she could see free movies; worked as a restaurant hostess, where her meals were free; and worked as a store cashier at Disneyland, where she had free admission. She often had two jobs at one time. Her last job, which was solely for the paycheck, was a full-time job at an eyeglass factory, inspecting contact lenses. In 1972, the 17-year-old was attending a Rolling Stones concert when she was approached by John Crosby, a scout and manager from International Creative Management. He told her she should be a model and had test photos made of her. Within a few months, Rene signed a contract with Ford Modeling Agency and within a year had become a successful print and photographers model. Soon her modeling breakthrough came when she graced the cover of Vogue. By 1975, she had appeared on numerous magazine covers, was one of the most successful models in America, and was also starting to be seen in several TV commercials through the 1980s. She would define what a top fashion model was for years to come. By her 30th birthday, demand for her began to dwindle, as it did for most models at that age. She did a few more commercials and then turned her back on modeling and show business for a while. Financially secure for the next several years, she began an intense period of literature and Christian theology. She also began to study theater and acting, and began appearing in theater roles at small regional theaters in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California. Her television series debut came in 1987 with a supporting part on the short-lived TV series Sable (1987). In 1989 she made her motion picture debut with the part of the lead characters girlfriend in the film Major League (1989). Her subsequent roles were that of girlfriends and supportive wives in a few films, until her breakthrough as an Internal Affairs detective in Lethal Weapon 3 (1992). Rene Russo has been praised for her ability to hold her own against her major male co-stars, which have included Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, Kevin Costner and Pierce Brosnan. Two of her performances within the last few years have gotten her recognition as both a major dramatic actress and a talented character actress. One was as the mother of a kidnapped son in Ransom (1996). The other was as the cartoon femme fatale foreign spy in The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000). Although the latter received mixed reviews among moviegoers and critics, Russo was praised for her performance of a role originally slated for Meryl Streep in 1992. Rene Russo has been married to screenwriter Dan Gilroy since 1992, and they have one daughter, named Rose. They reside in Brentwood, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDI4MDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzI3NjE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000623","name":"Rene Russo","idIMDB":"nm0000623"},"actorId":"nm0000623","character":"Frigga","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0173777","main":true},{"actorName":"Adriana Barraza","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056770","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NzE3MTYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwNzIzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 March 1956","placeOfBirth":" Toluca, Estado de Mexico, Mexico","height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Adriana Barraza was born on March 5, 1956 in Toluca, Estado de Mexico, Mexico.
