She was born in Lakewood, Ohio, the daughter of Eddie Garr (born Edward Leo Gonnoud), a Broadway stage and film actor, and Phyllis Garr (née Emma Schmotzer), a dancer. Her maternal grandparents were Austrian, and her father was of Irish descent. While she was still an infant, her family moved from Hollywood to New Jersey but, after the death of her father when she was 11, the family returned to Hollywood, where her mother became a wardrobe mistress for movies and television. While Garr's dancing can be seen in nine Elvis Presley movies, her first speaking role in motion pictures was in the 1968 feature Head (1968), starring The Monkees. In the 1970s she became well established in television with appearances on shows such as Star Trek (1966), It Takes a Thief (1968) and McCloud (1970), and became a semi-regular on The Sonny and Cher Show (1976) as Cher's friend, Olivia. Garr has since risen to become one of Hollywood's most versatile, energetic and well-recognized actresses. She has starred in many memorable films, including Young Frankenstein (1974), Oh, God! (1977), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Mr. Mom (1983), After Hours (1985) and her Academy Award-nominated performance for Best Supporting Actress in Tootsie (1982). Other film roles include The Black Stallion (1979), One from the Heart (1981), The Escape Artist (1982), Firstborn (1984), Let It Ride (1989), Full Moon in Blue Water (1988), Out Cold (1989), Short Time (1990), Waiting for the Light (1990), Mom and Dad Save the World (1992), Perfect Alibi (1995), Ready to Wear (1994) and A Simple Wish (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0ODg1Mjc0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTU3NzQ1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000414","name":"Teri Garr","idIMDB":"nm0000414"},"actorId":"nm0000414","character":"Margaret Lightman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Benjamin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000907","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNjc5Mjk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY5MDAxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 May 1938","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Although his actress wife Paula Prentiss became a star by the early 1960s, it took Richard Benjamin almost fifteen years to establish his screen persona, but the wait was rewarding. After extensive work in theatre as actor and director, and his participation in the cult TV series He & She (1967), in which he co-starred with Prentiss, he won the starring role in the screen adaptation of Philip Roth's best-seller, Goodbye, Columbus (1969). That was followed by roles in Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970), The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971) and another Roth adaptation, Portnoy's Complaint (1972), that turned him into a prominent \"archetype of East Coast Jewish intellectual agony\", as critic Jonathan Romney defines him. But his forte was comedy and he won a Golden Globe when he repeated his stage role in the film version of Neil Simon's The Sunshine Boys (1975). Although he still performs, Benjamin turned to direction since the 80s with the highly acclaimed comedy My Favorite Year (1982).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNjc5Mjk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY5MDAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000907","name":"Richard Benjamin","idIMDB":"nm0000907"},"actorId":"nm0000907","character":"Joshua Lightman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lana Turner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001805","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NTg1NzQ4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTgyNzM2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 February 1921","placeOfBirth":" Wallace, Idaho, USA","birthName":"Julia Jean Mildred Frances Turner","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Lana Turner had an acting ability that belied the \"Sweater Girl\" image MGM thrust upon her, and even many of her directors admitted that they knew she was capable of greatness (check out The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946)). Unfortunately, her private life sometimes overshadowed her professional accomplishments. Lana Turner was born Julia Jean Mildred Francis Turner in Wallace, Idaho. There is some discrepancy as to whether her birth date is February 8, 1920 or 1921. Lana herself said in her autobiography that she was one year younger (1921) than the records showed, but then this was a time where women, especially actresses, tended to \"fib\" a bit about their age. Most sources agree that 1920 is the correct year of birth. Her parents were Mildred Frances (Cowan) and John Virgil Turner, a miner, both still in their teens when she was born. In 1929, her father was murdered and it was shortly thereafter her mother moved her and the family to California where jobs were \"plentiful\". Once she matured into a beautiful young woman, she went after something that would last forever: stardom. She wasn't found at a drug store counter, like some would have you believe, but that legend persists. She pounded the pavement as other would-be actors and actresses have done, are doing and will continue to do in search of movie roles. In 1937, Lana entered the movie world, at 17, with small parts in They Won't Forget (1937), The Great Garrick (1937) and A Star Is Born (1937). These films didn't bring her a lot of notoriety, but it was a start. In 1938 she had another small part in Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938) starring Mickey Rooney. It was this film that made young men's hearts all over America flutter at the sight of this alluring and provocative young woman--known as the \"Sweater Girl\"--and one look at that film could make you understand why: she was one of the most spectacularly beautiful newcomers to grace the screen in years. By the 1940s Lana was firmly entrenched in the film business. She had good roles in such films as Johnny Eager (1941), Somewhere I'll Find You (1942) and Week-End at the Waldorf (1945). If her career was progressing smoothly, however, her private life was turning into a train wreck, keeping her in the news in a way no one would have wanted. Without a doubt her private life was a threat to her public career. She was married eight times, twice to Stephen Crane. She also married Ronald Dante, Robert Eaton, Fred May, Lex Barker, Henry Topping and bandleader Artie Shaw. She also battled alcoholism. In yet another scandal, her daughter by Crane, Cheryl Crane, fatally stabbed Lana's boyfriend, gangster Johnny Stompanato, in 1958. It was a case that would have rivaled the O.J. Simpson murder case. Cheryl was acquitted of the murder charge, with the jury finding that she had been protecting her mother from Stompanato, who was savagely beating her, and ruled it justifiable homicide. These and other incidents interfered with Lana's career, but she persevered. The release of Imitation of Life (1959), a remake of a 1934 film (Imitation of Life (1934)), was Lana's comeback vehicle. Her performance as Lora Meredith was flawless as an actress struggling to make it in show business with a young daughter, her housekeeper and the housekeeper's rebellious daughter. The film was a box-office success and proved beyond a doubt that Lana had not lost her edge. By the 1960s, however, fewer roles were coming her way with the rise of new and younger stars. She still managed to turn in memorable performances in such films as Portrait in Black (1960) and Bachelor in Paradise (1961). By the next decade the roles were coming in at a trickle. Her last appearance in a big-screen production was in Witches' Brew (1980). Her final film work came in the acclaimed TV series Falcon Crest (1981) in which she played Jacqueline Perrault from 1982-1983. After all those years as a sex symbol, nothing had changed--Lana was still as beautiful as ever. She died June 25, 1995, in Culver City, California, after a long bout with cancer. She was 75 years old.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NTg1NzQ4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTgyNzM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001805","name":"Lana Turner","nicknames":["Sweater Girl","Judy"],"idIMDB":"nm0001805"},"actorId":"nm0001805","character":"Vivian Cross","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Winkler","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935178","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Winkler is an actor, known for Jagged Edge (1985), Witches' Brew (1980) and Desert Diners (2000).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935178","name":"James Winkler","idIMDB":"nm0935178"},"actorId":"nm0935178","character":"Linus Cross","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kathryn Leigh Scott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0779421","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxOTcwNTc5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgxODMzOTE@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 January 1943","placeOfBirth":" Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","birthName":"Marlene Kathryn Kringstad","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Kathryn Leigh Scott was born on January 26, 1943 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA as Marlene Kathryn Kringstad.

DeMille). His film debut came as another \"Tall Man\" he played Abraham Lincoln in an educational film made by Encyclopaedia Brittanica, which led him to a steady career in theater, television and film. His big-screen debut was in Jim, the World's Greatest (1976), directed by then 18-year-old Coscarelli. During this time he was using his birth name, Lawrence Rory Guy. He adopted the stage name Angus Scrimm three years later for his performance in Coscarelli's horror/sci-fi opus \"Phantasm\", which would mark Scrimm's permanent impression upon modern cinema. His role as the infamous Tall Man has earned him the praise of critics worldwide, as well as a large following of fans. His success in the \"Phantasm\" films has been parlayed into numerous other malevolent roles including the evil Dr. Sin Do in The Lost Empire (1984), Vlad the Vampire King in Subspecies (1991) and the nefarious Dr. Lyme opposite Nicolas Cage and Charlie Sheen in Deadfall (1993). Scrimm did intriguing double duty as the diabolical Seer and the angelic Systems Operator in Mindwarp (1992), co-starring Bruce Campbell. He did a shock cameo in the Italian film Fatal Frames - Fotogrammi mortali (1996), opposite Stefania Stella and Donald Pleasence, and managed a gleeful parody of himself as the hulking henchman in Transylvania Twist (1989). Scrimm has not limited his career efforts to simply acting, however. As a journalist he has written and edited for \"TV Guide\", \"Cinema Magazine\", the now-defunct \"Los Angeles Herald-Examiner\" and other publications. He has also written liner notes for thousands of LPs and CDs, for just about every genre from classical music to jazz, from Frank Sinatra and The Beatles to Artur Rubinstein and Itzhak Perlman. He won a Grammy award for best album liner notes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMwMTY1NDQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM5OTgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780133","name":"Angus Scrimm","idIMDB":"nm0780133"},"actorId":"nm0780133","character":"Carl Groton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Carlos Royval","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0747465","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Carlos Royval is an actor, known for Witches' Brew (1980).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0747465","name":"Carlos Royval","idIMDB":"nm0747465"},"actorId":"nm0747465","character":"Patrol Officer #1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tony Kulik","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0474547","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tony Kulik is an actor, known for Witches' Brew (1980).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0474547","name":"Tony Kulik","idIMDB":"nm0474547"},"actorId":"nm0474547","character":"Patrol Officer #2","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gerald Ray","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712835","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Gerald Ray is an actor, known for Witches' Brew (1980), Mr. and Mrs. Cop (1974) and On the Air Live with Captain Midnight (1979).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712835","name":"Gerald Ray","idIMDB":"nm0712835"},"actorId":"nm0712835","character":"Meter Officer #1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0081763","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081763","business":{"budget":{"money":"$700,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 38 min (98 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"4.3","filmingLocations":[],"rated":"PG","awards":[],"votes":"118","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[],"keywords":{"keywords":["witchcraft","professor","body swap","monster","college","based on novel","independent film"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 07:31:14"}}
