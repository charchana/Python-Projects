Josie Davis began her career at the age of 3, starring in numerous television commercials. She was cast as a series regular on the hit television show Charles in Charge (1984) (Davis played the adorable, intelligent poet \"Sarah Powell\" opposite heartthrob Scott Baio). The show was rated number-one in syndication. After wrapping \"Charles in Charge\", the straight-A student graduated from high school and battled the image that she created playing the quiet, sweet, bookish, little girl. Although she had the option of entering USC's prestigious writing program, Davis decided to continue acting and to shed the \"Sarah Powell\" image. At the age of 24, Davis auditioned for Hollywood heavyweights, Shelley Winters, Mark Rydell and Martin Landau. Davis was accepted as a member to The Actor's Studio after only two auditions. Davis graduated to adult roles and quickly landed a role as a series regular on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990), playing the part of sexy, \"Camille Desmond\", which she starred in through the end of the series. The following season, Davis was cast as a series regular on the Aaron Spelling show, Titans (2000). Davis took a brief reprieve from television and was immediately cast in six films. After searching endlessly for the perfect actress, Nicolas Cage cast Davis in his directorial debut, Sonny (2002). Davis was cast opposite James Franco in a star-studded cast that included Brenda Blethyn, Harry Dean Stanton and Scott Caan. Davis returned to television and landed parts in highly-rated television films like Psychic Murders (2002), alongside Henry Rollins and James Russo. She followed that success with notable turns in the critically-acclaimed dramas Philly (2001) with Kim Delaney, The Division (2001), CSI: Miami (2002) alongside David Caruso and Blind Injustice (2005), to name just a few. Davis was also cast opposite Jennifer Love Hewitt and Ed O'Neill in a pilot for ABC called In the Game (2004). Davis continued to explore her comedic side playing Carol Cavanaugh in the film Kalamazoo? (2006) co-starring Claire Bloom, Renée Taylor and Chita Rivera. She also completed filming the motion picture In the Land of Merry Misfits (2007), produced by Maria Menounos, narrated by John Waters. The film was accepted into 2007's \"Tribeca Film Festival\". Chuck Lorre cast Josie saying, \"I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role\" for a very memorable guest-star in the 2005 Christmas episode of the CBS hit, Two and a Half Men (2003). US Weekly chose this episode as a \"Must See\". Next for this talented actress were starring roles in the films Tranced (2010) directed by The Sandlot (1993) and Radio Flyer (1992) director, David M. Evans; The Trouble with Romance (2007), Paul Haggis had a hand in the writing of this film, co-starring Kip Pardue; Carolina Moon (2007) alongside Claire Forlani and Oliver Hudson; and McBride: Requiem (2008) with John Larroquette. Davis was the lead in four independent films back to back; Twilight (2008), a short film opposite respected Ellen Geer, the comedy Chasing Tchaikovsky (2007) with Ann Magnuson, the horror film The Cursed (2010) opposite Costas Mandylor and, finally, she played the perfect assistant to Chris Potter in longtime producer Pierre David's film, Une assistante presque parfaite (2008). Josie recently worked opposite David Spade on Rules of Engagement (2007) as well as opposite Clifton Collins Jr. in the NBC show Fear Itself (2008), directed by Freddy vs. Jason (2003) director Ronny Yu. She then shot a comedy pilot produced by J.J. Abrams film The Suburbans (1999)' writer/producer, Tony Guma. She has guest starred on Burn Notice (2007), Bones (2005), Chuck (2007) as well as a recurring role on CSI: NY (2004) opposite Skeet Ulrich. Josie joined James Franco, also doing a recurring role, on the English speaking novella, Hollywood Heights (2012), opposite Couples Retreat (2009)'s Carlos Ponce. She is the female lead in Hallmarks Channel's Notes from Dad (2013), one of their anticipated movies, directed by ER's Eriq La Salle, opposite Eddie Cibrian. In addition to a busy acting career, Davis produced the award-winning comedy short film, Lotto (2003), starring herself, as well as producing music videos and writing a screenplay. Josie is involved in many charities, especially volunteer work at animal and shelters and mobile adoptions.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NjkxMjkyMzVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYzMjg1Mzgx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004861","name":"Josie Davis","idIMDB":"nm0004861"},"actorId":"nm0004861","character":"Ava Fletcher","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Karis Campbell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1388719","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIwMTk4ZDQtYjBiOS00Yzk1LTgxOWEtMmY2ZDA0N2NmYmY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc1MjQ0NQ@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Karis Alexandra Campbell","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Karis Campbell was born in Hong Kong as Karis Alexandra Campbell.
