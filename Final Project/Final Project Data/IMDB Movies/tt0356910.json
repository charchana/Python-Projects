However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in Moneyball (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography. Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\". Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992). But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in Twelve Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence. He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Peña. Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MjE2MTQ2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE5MDY0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093","name":"Brad Pitt","idIMDB":"nm0000093"},"actorId":"nm0000093","character":"John Smith","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005693","main":true},{"actorName":"Angelina Jolie","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg3MzYwMjE4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU5NzAzNw@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 June 1975","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Angelina Jolie Voight","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Angelina Jolie is an Oscar-winning actress who became popular after playing the title role in the \"Lara Croft\" blockbuster movies, as well as Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Wanted (2008), Salt (2010) and Maleficent (2014). Off-screen, Jolie has become prominently involved in international charity projects, especially those involving refugees. She often appears on many \"most beautiful women\" lists, and she has a personal life that is avidly covered by the tabloid press. Jolie was born Angelina Jolie Voight in Los Angeles, California. In her earliest years, Angelina began absorbing the acting craft from her actor parents, Jon Voight, an Oscar-winner, and Marcheline Bertrand, who had studied with Lee Strasberg. Her good looks may derive from her ancestry, which is German and Slovak on her father's side, and French-Canadian, Dutch, Polish, and remote Huron, on her mother's side. At age eleven, Angelina began studying at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she was seen in several stage productions. She undertook some film studies at New York University and later joined the renowned Met Theatre Group in Los Angeles. At age 16, she took up a career in modeling and appeared in some music videos. In the mid-1990s, Jolie appeared in various small films where she got good notices, including Hackers (1995) and Foxfire (1996). Her critical acclaim increased when she played strong roles in the made-for-TV movies True Women (1997), and in George Wallace (1997) which won her a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy nomination. Jolie's acclaim increased even further when she played the lead role in the HBO production Gia (1998). This was the true life story of supermodel Gia Carangi, a sensitive wild child who was both brazen and needy and who had a difficult time handling professional success and the deaths of people who were close to her. Carangi became involved with drugs and because of her needle-using habits she became, at the tender age of 26, one of the first celebrities to die of AIDS. Jolie's performance in Gia (1998) again garnered a Golden Globe Award and another Emmy nomination, and she additionally earned a SAG Award. Angelina got a major break in 1999 when she won a leading role in the successful feature The Bone Collector (1999), starring alongside Denzel Washington. In that same year, Jolie gave a tour de force performance in Girl, Interrupted (1999) playing opposite Winona Ryder. The movie was a true story of women who spent time in a psychiatric hospital. Jolie's role was reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), the role which won Nicholson his first Oscar. Unlike \"Cuckoo\", \"Girl\" was a small film that received mixed reviews and barely made money at the box office. But when it came time to give out awards, Jolie won the triple crown -- \"Girl\" propelled her to win the Golden Globe Award, the SAG Award and the Academy Award for best leading actress in a supporting role. With her new-found prominence, Jolie began to get in-depth attention from the press. Numerous aspects of her controversial personal life became news. At her wedding to her Hackers (1995) co-star Jonny Lee Miller, she had displayed her husband's name on the back of her shirt painted in her own blood. Jolie and Miller divorced, and in 2000, she married her Pushing Tin (1999) co-star Billy Bob Thornton. Jolie had become the fifth wife of a man twenty years her senior. During her marriage to Thornton, the spouses each wore a vial of the other's blood around their necks. That marriage came apart in 2002 and ended in divorce. In addition, Jolie was estranged from her famous father, Jon Voight. In 2000, Jolie was asked to star in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). At first, she expressed disinterest, but then decided that the required training for the athletic role was intriguing. The Croft character was drawn from a popular video game. Lara Croft was a female cross between Indiana Jones and James Bond. When the film was released, critics were unimpressed with the final product, but critical acclaim wasn't the point of the movie. The public paid $275 million for theater tickets to see a buffed up Jolie portray the adventuresome Lara Croft. Jolie's father Jon Voight appeared in \"Croft\", and during filming there was a brief rapprochement between father and daughter. One of the Croft movie's filming locations was Cambodia. While there, Jolie witnessed the natural beauty, culture and poverty of that country. She considered this an eye opening experience, and so began the humanitarian chapter of her life. Jolie began visiting refugee camps around the world and came to be formally appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Some of her experiences were written and published in her popular book \"Notes from My Travels\" whose profits go to UNHCR. Jolie has stated that she now plans to spend most of her time in humanitarian efforts, to be financed by her actress salary. She devotes one third of her income to savings, one third to living expenses and one third to charity. In 2002, Angelina adopted a Cambodian refugee boy named Maddox, and in 2005, adopted an Ethiopian refugee girl named Zahara. Jolie's dramatic feature film Beyond Borders (2003) parallels some of her real life humanitarian experiences although, despite the inclusion of a romance between two westerners, many of the movie's images were too depressingly realistic -- the film was not popular among critics or at the box office. In 2004, Jolie began filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) with co-star Brad Pitt. The film became a major box office success. There were rumors that Pitt and Jolie had an affair while filming \"Smith\". Jolie insisted that because her mother had been hurt by adultery, she herself could never participate in an affair with a married man, therefore there had been no affair with Pitt at that time. Nonetheless, Pitt separated from his wife Jennifer Aniston in January 2005 and, in the months that followed, he was frequently seen in public with Jolie, apparently as a couple. Pitt's divorce was finalized later in 2005. Jolie and Pitt announced in early 2006 that they would have a child together, and Jolie gave birth to daughter Shiloh that May. They also adopted a three-year-old Vietnamese boy named Pax. The couple, who married in 2014, continue to pursue movie and humanitarian projects, and now have a total of six children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg3MzYwMjE4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU5NzAzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001401","name":"Angelina Jolie","nicknames":["Angie","Ange","AJ"],"idIMDB":"nm0001401"},"actorId":"nm0001401","character":"Jane Smith","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005694","main":true},{"actorName":"Vince Vaughn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDA0MzE0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUzOTI4._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 March 1970","placeOfBirth":" Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","birthName":"Vincent Anthony Vaughn","height":"6' 5\" (1.96 m)","bio":"Vincent Anthony Vaughn was born on March 28, 1970, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, and was raised in Lake Forest, Illinois.

He has two older sisters, Victoria Vaughn and Valeri Vaughn. His recent ancestry includes Lebanese (from his paternal grandmother), Italian (from his maternal grandfather), English, Irish, German, and Scottish. His mother was born in Brantford, Ontario. Vince was interested in theater early on and grabbed a spot in a Chevy commercial. In 1988 he moved to Hollywood. He managed to hit a few spots on television, but his real goal was to make it to the big screen. He made his first credited role in the film Rudy (1993) where he met his friend Jon Favreau, who was writing a script detailing his life as an out-of-work actor. Vince was written into Swingers (1996) by Jon to play the character of \"Trent\". He signed on just as a favor to his buddy, not realizing it would be a career changing role. Though not a commercial success, it was a critical success in which Steven Spielberg saw him and cast him in the big budget sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). This role gave Vince the exposure he needed to become a movie star and, for the first time, choose the roles he wanted to take. A Cool, Dry Place (1998) put him as a loving father, Return to Paradise (1998) cast him as a man having to make a life or death decision to save a friend, and Clay Pigeons (1998) cast him as an interesting serial killer. Since then his roles have been primarily in comedies such as Old School (2003), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), Wedding Crashers (2005), and Couples Retreat (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDA0MzE0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUzOTI4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681","name":"Vince Vaughn","nicknames":["Mr Sunshine"],"idIMDB":"nm0000681"},"actorId":"nm0000681","character":"Eddie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005695","main":true},{"actorName":"Adam Brody","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111013","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY3NzMzMjgyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc2OTM4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 December 1979","placeOfBirth":" San Diego, California, USA","birthName":"Adam Jared Brody","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Adam Jared Brody was born and raised in San Diego, California, the son of Valerie (Siefman), a graphic artist, and Mark Brody, a lawyer.

Her parents, both academics, were from upper-class families. Her paternal grandfather, Hazard E. Reeves, was a sound pioneer who introduced magnetic stereophonic sound to films, and her maternal great-grandfather, James H. Hughes, was a U.S. Senator from Delaware (from 1937 to 1943). Perrey's parents preferred not to own a television but rather submerge their children in the vast realms of literature. Thus, her educational background ranged from years abroad in France and Italy to the Ivy League colleges of the US. Drama studies were what really interested her, however, resulting in her choosing an acting career. Her interests are as eclectic and diverse as the roles she has played and the life she has led. A lifelong vegetarian, she finds mental and physical balance in meditation and yoga, which she has faithfully practiced for over a decade. In the midst of acting, she also focuses much of her creative energies renovating a new home with her fiancée. She describes their abode as a \"quaint country oasis in the hills of Hollywood\". When not standing in line at Home Depot, she passionately donates her time to The International Fund for Animal Welfare and lives with many furry creatures. She joins the comically dynamic cast in DreamWorks' October release, Old School (2003), directed by Todd Phillips. Co-starring opposite Will Ferrell, she plays his traditional wife who is dedicated to the white picket fence dream. Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Leah Remini and Ellen Pompeo round out the stellar cast. Perrey is accomplished on both the big and small screens. She has co-starred in features such as Tri-Star's The Suburbans (1999), Miramax's Phoenix Arizona (1998), Trimark's Kicking and Screaming (1995) and Universal's Child's Play 3 (1991). She has landed series regular roles in four pilots and has guest starred on numerous television shows ranging from Fox's The X-Files (1993) to the WB's Off Centre (2001). She has played lead roles in made-for-television movies, including CBS' An Element of Truth (1995) and ABC's Escape to Witch Mountain (1995). Perrey showcased her talents on stage in theater productions of \"High Tor\", \"House Arrest\", \"Women of Manhattan\", \"Picnic\" and \"Last Night at Ballyhoo\" at The Canon Theatre in which she played Rhea Perlman's daughter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NzM5MTI0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc5MzQzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716275","name":"Perrey Reeves","idIMDB":"nm0716275"},"actorId":"nm0716275","character":"Jessie - Associate #4","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Melanie Tolbert","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1944626","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2OTc5ODc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg1NTEzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Melanie Tolbert is an actress and writer, known for Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), Garfield 2 (2006) and American Reunion (2012).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2OTc5ODc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg1NTEzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1944626","name":"Melanie Tolbert","idIMDB":"nm1944626"},"actorId":"nm1944626","character":"Jamie - Associate #5","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jerry T.
