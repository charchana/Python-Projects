She has two older brothers. Her family is of Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent. Marlee lost much of her hearing at the age of eighteen months. That did not stop her from acting in a children's theater company at age seven; she was Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Her deafness never held her back. As an adult she said it so eloquently: \"I have always resisted putting limitations on myself, both professionally and personally.\" Marlee studied criminal justice at Harper College in Palatine, Illinois, and maintained her passion for acting after graduating. While performing on stage throughout Chicago and the Midwest, Marlee attracted notice for her performance in a production of the Tony Award-winning play \"Children of a Lesser God\" and was cast in the movie version, Children of a Lesser God (1986). Although this was her film debut, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. While shooting her next movie, Walker (1987), in Nicaragua, big-hearted Marlee took time to visit both hearing and hearing-impaired children. She continued this tradition of visiting local children throughout her travels to Germany, England, Italy, Australia, Mexico, Canada, etc. Her interest in the criminal justice field played a part in her on screen career; she portrayed an assistant D.A. in the TV series Reasonable Doubts (1991), while off screen she married police officer Kevin Grandalski on August 29, 1993. The couple has four children. Marlee was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1994 for her performance as Laurie Bey in the Picket Fences (1992) episode \"Dancing Bandit.\" Marlee is also a spokeswoman for the National Captioning Institute. In 1995, she testified at a congressional hearing and helped get a law passed that requires all TV sets 13 inches or larger to be manufactured with built-in chips to provide closed captioning on their screens; this was a godsend for deaf viewers. Marlee serves as the national spokeswoman for the largest provider of TV closed captioning, and has spoken on behalf of CC in countries such as Australia, England, France, and Italy. She also serves on the boards of a number of charitable organizations, including Very Special Arts, the Starlight Foundation, and other charities that primarily benefit children. As someone who loves children so much, it is only fitting that she has four of her own. Professionally, Marlee has even tried producing, being the executive producer for Where the Truth Lies (1999).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMjAxMzI0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIyOTgyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0559144","name":"Marlee Matlin","idIMDB":"nm0559144"},"actorId":"nm0559144","character":"Diner Patron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tim Peddicord","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6686438","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tim Peddicord is an actor, known for The One I Love (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6686438","name":"Tim Peddicord","idIMDB":"nm6686438"},"actorId":"nm6686438","character":"Diner Patron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryan Pederson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6686439","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ryan Pederson is an actor, known for The One I Love (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6686439","name":"Ryan Pederson","idIMDB":"nm6686439"},"actorId":"nm6686439","character":"Diner Patron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brett Bietz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5672956","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Brett Bietz is known for his work on The One I Love (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5672956","name":"Brett Bietz","idIMDB":"nm5672956"},"actorId":"nm5672956","character":"Doug","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sean O'Malley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1545860","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1979","placeOfBirth":" Youngstown, Ohio, USA","bio":"Sean O'Malley was born on June 30, 1979 in Youngstown, Ohio, USA.

She was born February 8, 1953, in Newport, Arkansas, USA. Her mother, Nellie May (Wall) Steenburgen, was a school-board secretary, and her father, Maurice H. Steenburgen, was a freight-train conductor. Her surname comes from distant Dutch ancestry, and her roots also include English, Scottish, and Welsh. Young Steenburgen was fond of arts and literature. Mary grew up tap-dancing her way through talent shows and school functions. She was active in her school drama class. After appearing in a number of high school plays, she enrolled at Hendrix College, a highly progressive Southern School located in Conway, Arkansas. Upon the recommendation of her drama professor, she left college in 1972 and moved to New York to study acting professionally. In the past several years, Mary Steenburgen has emerged as one of the most accomplished and sought-after screen actresses. Ever since Jack Nicholson 'discovered' her and cast her as a sassy adventuress in his rollicking western, Goin' South (1978), her career has skyrocketed and she has won acclaim for exceptional performances in each of her diverse film roles. In Nicholas Meyer's Time After Time (1979), Steenburgen was afforded critical praise for her portrayal of a somewhat dippy but liberated young bank clerk in San Francisco who crosses paths, via time machine, with English author H.G. Wells (played by Malcolm McDowell, who later became her husband. In 1980 she shot to fame with her role as Lynda Dummar in Melvin and Howard (1980) for which she won Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. More recently, Steenburgen again impressed audiences and critics alike with her stunning performance as the strong-willed turn-of-the-century Mother in Ragtime (1981). Steenburgen is a notable patron of arts. She is also an active supporter of humanitarian causes. She has two children from her previous marriage to actor Malcolm McDowell. Since 1995 she has been married to actor Ted Danson, and the couple is living in Los Angeles area.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OTI5OTc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc5NDMwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005460","name":"Mary Steenburgen","idIMDB":"nm0005460"},"actorId":"nm0005460","character":"Mom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Drew Langer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2427020","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Drew Langer is an assistant director and producer, known for The One I Love (2014), Dreamland (2016) and There Is a New World Somewhere (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2427020","name":"Drew Langer","idIMDB":"nm2427020"},"actorId":"nm2427020","character":"Brett","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jennifer Spriggs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3106105","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzgzNzU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIyMTYzNjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Jennifer Spriggs is an actress and producer, known for Togetherness (2015), Mad Men (2007) and The One I Love (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzgzNzU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIyMTYzNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3106105","name":"Jennifer Spriggs","idIMDB":"nm3106105"},"actorId":"nm3106105","character":"Ellen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlie McDowell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1660595","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M3NTFlOGMtZWQ3ZC00YWU3LTk2MWYtZDdhOTk3YTUxZDQwL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg0OTgyNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 July 1983","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Charles Malcolm McDowell","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Charlie McDowell was born on July 10, 1983 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Charles Malcolm McDowell.
