With the help of Selenia and Betameche, he hatches a plan to regain his usual size: all they must do is infiltrate Arthur's house through the pipeworks, catch an electric train from his bedroom to his grandfather's study and find an elixir that will make him grow back to his human size. Sounds simple enough, if it weren't for Darkos, Maltazard's own son, hot on their tails.","simplePlot":"With Maltazard now 7 feet tall and Arthur still 2 inches small, our hero must find a way to grow back to his normal size ans stop the Evil M once and for all, with the help of Selenia and Betameche.","actors":[{"actorName":"Mia Farrow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3NjgxMzQ5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEzNTkzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 February 1945","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Maria de Lourdes Villiers-Farrow","height":"5' 4¼\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Mia Farrow was born in Los Angeles, California, to director John Farrow and actress and Tarzan-girl Maureen O'Sullivan.
