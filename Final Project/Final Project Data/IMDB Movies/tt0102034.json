Inspired through his having appeared in a play at age 12, he went to the Paris Conservatoire where he remained for two years. After a few small parts in French films, beginning in 1980, he successfully competed for the title role in Warner Bros. Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984). His co-stars included Ian Holm, James Fox and Ralph Richardson (in his final film performance). The movie was popular with Tarzan buffs for remaining faithful (in the first half at least) to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original story. Two years later Lambert brought to the screen Gregory Widens' legendary Connor MacLeod, the immortal Highlander (1986), born in the Highlands of Scotland in 1518 and carrying over into the futuristic Highlander II: The Quickening (1991) and Highlander: The Final Dimension (1994).

In 1988, Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables (1987). His film career also includes such films as Marnie (1964), The Name of the Rose (1986), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Highlander (1986), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), DragonHeart (1996) and The Rock (1996). Connery has been polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted \"Sexiest Man of the Century\". Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Euphemia McBain (née McLean), was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He has a brother, Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves. No Road Back (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it followed by several Tv-movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) and guest appearances on TV-series, and also films such as Hell Drivers (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), The Frightened City (1961). In 1962 he appeared in The Longest Day (1962) with a host of other stars. Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. He played the character in the first five Bond films: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), and You Only Live Twice (1967) - then appeared again as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, \"He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks\", and \"I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man,\" adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2\", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming's girlfriend told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No (1962) premiere. He was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels. Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film. During the filming of Thunderball (1965), Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately. Connery was forced to wear a toupee during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 17. This didn't prevent Connery from being cast in roles, although it became more noticeable in his later years. In 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled From Russia with Love (2005), which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast. After and during the success of the Bond-films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander (1986), The Name of the Rose (1986), The Untouchables (1987) (which earned him an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Rising Sun (1993), The Rock (1996), Finding Forrester (2000), and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963, he followed in his father's footsteps and also became an actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, they have no children together. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and his ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Quinn Connery, in 1997.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwNTM4MzctYjQzMi00NTA2LTljYWItNTYzNmE1MTYxN2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125","name":"Sean Connery","nicknames":["Big Tam"],"idIMDB":"nm0000125"},"actorId":"nm0000125","character":"Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005516","main":true},{"actorName":"Virginia Madsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000515","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUyMDcxNTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAwNjQzMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 September 1961","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"One of the hottest stars of the mid-1980s, Virginia Madsen has since played a variety of roles that have cemented her reputation as a fantastic actress who can adapt to any part. Virginia was born in Chicago, Illinois, and belongs to an acting family -- with her brother, Michael Madsen, also an actor, and her mother, Elaine Madsen (née Melson), an Emmy-winning writer, poet, and producer. Her paternal grandparents were Danish, and her father, Calvin Madsen, was a firefighter. Audiences first caught a glimpse of her as \"Princess Irulan\" in the 1984 science fiction epic Dune (1984). She followed that up with Electric Dreams (1984); however, it was in 1986 that Virginia captured the hearts of the audience with an intense portrayal of a Catholic school girl who fell in love with a boy from a prison camp in Duncan Gibbins' Fire with Fire (1986). Virginia played the role of \"Lisa\" and her co-star was Craig Sheffer, who played Lisa's love interest, \"Joe Fisk\". Kari Wuhrer also made an appearance as Virginia's best friend, \"Gloria\". Fire with Fire (1986) was a low-budget production, starring a bunch of fresh faces who were till then-unknown to Hollywood. However, the movie was a success and elevated its three young stars overnight. Virginia has never looked back since. Not only did she receive amazing reviews for her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated performance in Alexander Payne's hit film, Sideways (2004), but this Independent Spirit Award-winning actress has an illustrious resume of roles alongside the most notable and respected actors in the business. Also on Virginia's slate is her production company, with partner Karly Meola, called \"Title IX Productions\". Their first project was the documentary I Know a Woman Like That (2009), which previewed at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009 and premiered at the Chicago Film Festival in October 2009. The doc was directed by Virginia's mother, Elaine Madsen, about the lives of extraordinary women ages 64-94. Next in the company's lineup is the documentary Fighting Gravity (2010), about women ski jumpers' ongoing battle for the right to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Title IX will team up with \"Empire 8 Productions\" and Vancouver-based \"Screen Siren\" on the project. The duo also has several projects in development that they're shopping around for financing including screenwriters Sebastian Gutierrez's screen adaptation of Martha O'Connor's novel \"The Bitch Posse\" and a remake of the 1984 film Electric Dreams (1984), in which Virginia appeared.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjUyMDcxNTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAwNjQzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000515","name":"Virginia Madsen","nicknames":["Gina"],"idIMDB":"nm0000515"},"actorId":"nm0000515","character":"Louise Marcus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005518","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Ironside","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000461","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NTg3MDYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0ODc3ODE@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 February 1950","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Frederick Reginald Ironside","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Michael Ironside has made a strong and indelible impression with his often incredibly intense and explosive portrayals of fearsome villains throughout the years. He was born as Frederick Reginald Ironside on February 12, 1950 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ironside was a successful arm wrestler in his teenage years. His initial ambition was to be a writer. At age fifteen, Michael wrote a play called \"The Shelter\" that won first prize in a Canada-wide university contest; He used the prize money to mount a production of this play. Ironside attended the Ontario College of Art, took acting lessons from Janine Manatis, and studied for three years at the Canadian National Film Board. Ironside worked in construction as a roofer prior to embarking on an acting career. Ironside first began acting in movies in the late 1970s. He received plenty of recognition with his frightening turn as deadly and powerful psychic Darryl Revok in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981). He was likewise very chilling as vicious misogynistic psychopath Colt Hawker in the underrated Terreur à l'hôpital central (1982). Other memorable film roles include weary Detective Roersch in the sadly forgotten thriller Cross Country (1983), the crazed Overdog in the immensely enjoyable Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983), the hard-nosed Jester in the blockbuster smash Top Gun (1986), ramrod Major Paul Hackett in Extreme Prejudice (1987), loner Vietnam veteran \"Ben\" in Nowhere to Hide (1987), the ferocious Lem Johnson in Watchers (1988), and lethal immortal General Katana in Highlander II: The Quickening (1991). Moreover, Ironside has appeared in two highly entertaining science fiction features for Paul Verhoeven: At his savage best as the evil Richter in Total Recall (1990) and typically excellent as the rugged Lieutenant Jean Rasczak in Starship Troopers (1997). Ironside showed a more tender and thoughtful side with his lovely and touching performance as a hardened convict who befriends a disabled man in the poignant indie drama gem Chaindance (1991); he also co-wrote the script and served as an executive producer for this beautiful sleeper. Michael was terrific as tough mercenary Ham Tyler on the epic miniseries V (1984), its follow up V: The Final Battle (1984), and subsequent short-lived spin-off series. Ironside also had a recurring role on the television series SeaQuest 2032 (1993). Among the television series he has done guest spots on are The A-Team (1983), Hill Street Blues (1981), The New Mike Hammer (1984), Deadly Nightmares (1983), Tales from the Crypt (1989), Superman (1996), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), Au-delà du réel - l'aventure continue (1995), ER (1994), Smallville (2001), ER (1994), Desperate Housewives (2004), Justice League (2001) and Masters of Horror (2005). More recently, Ironside garnered a slew of plaudits and a Gemini Award nomination for his outstanding portrayal of shrewd biker gang leader Bob Durelle in the acclaimed Canadian miniseries The Last Chapter II: The War Continues (2003). In addition to his substantial film and television work, Ironside has also lent his distinctive deep voice to TV commercials and video games.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NTg3MDYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0ODc3ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000461","name":"Michael Ironside","idIMDB":"nm0000461"},"actorId":"nm0000461","character":"Gen.

Other feature film credits include Steven Speilberg's \"Amistad,\" \"Disclosure\" (as Demi Moore's attorney), and Robert Redford's \"Quiz Show.\" Critic Gary Franklin hailed his performance as Robert Kintner, President of NBC, `one of the Top Five of the Year.'

Robinson, Claude Raines, Ralph Bellamy, Jack Palance, Kim Hunter, Milton Berle, and Henry Fonda. He was enjoying the fruits of his labor until, without warning, his dreams were shattered when the McCarthy Era fell upon the nation and Allan was caught up in the `Red Scare' and blacklisted. With no income, a family to support and with little training outside of the acting profession, Rich cajoled his way onto Wall Street. After five years of buying and selling, he decided to open his own brokerage firm and with fervor, began to collect fine art. With the same drive and determination to master yet another field of endeavor, he soon became an expert in modern art, opening Allan Rich Galleries on Madison Avenue, where he began selling major paintings to important collectors and publishing lithographs of Miro, Calder, and Salvador Dali. His experience with Dali, in 1970, led him to co-write a screenplay \"Memories of Surrealism.\" Despite his enormous success outside of the entertainment field, Rich, separated from his professional passion, returned to the stage in Ron Ribman's \"Journey of the Fifth Horse,\" with a young Dustin Hoffman. He re-launched his film career in 1973 playing the D.A. in \"Serpico\" with Al Pacino. One of his main scenes was shown on the Academy Awards. Rich took out ads in the trades and received one call from John Crosby at ICM, who helped reestablished his reputation and went on to appear in more than 75 television shows, MOWs and 68 features that also include \"Frances, \"Eating Raoul,\" and \"Guilty By Suspicion.\" After years of teaching, Allan has developed his own acting technique, his book A Leap From the Method will be published this fall by Author House. Some of his more famous students include Sharon Stone, Jamie Lee Curtis, Rene Russo, Donna Dixon, Jack Scalia, Alan Thicke and Larry Miller. In addition, in 1994, Rich co-founded We Care About Kids, a non-profit organization that produces live action educational short films for middle and high school youths on socially relevant topics and has received praise for its efforts from President Clinton, Senator Diane Feinstein, former Speaker of the House, Richard Gephardt, former Governor Gray Davis and poet Maya Angelou.
