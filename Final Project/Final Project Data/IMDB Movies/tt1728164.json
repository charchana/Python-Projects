Van Eyssen","bio":"John van Eyssen (1922-1995) John van Eyssen wore several hats during his long professional career -- including that of Shakespearean thespian, movie actor, literary agent, producer and studio executive. Born and raised in South Africa, van Eyssen did not come to Great Britain until after WW II. Once in London, he studied drama at the Central School of Speech and Drama and, before graduation, joined the Royal Shakespeare Company. At the RSC, van Eyssen performed the major classical leads and also played Cassio in Orson Welles' production of Othello. As Lucifer in the York Cycle of Mystery Plays, van Eyssen inspired Dame Judi Dench, a teenager at the time, to pursue a career in acting. From there, van Eyssen branched out into radio, television and, beginning with The Angel with the Trumpet (1950), films, and went on to appear in a number of British movies of the period including Joseph Losey's Blind Date, Cockleshell Heroes and Carlton Browne of the F.O. In 1958, he appeared as Jonathan Harker in Hammer Films' cult classic, The Horror of Dracula. Van Eyssen abandoned acting in 1961 to become a literary agent for London Management. He proved to have a knack for the job and was quickly promoted to helm the literary department. He became so important that, when the company merged with London Artists, he was in charge of handling Franco Zeffirelli, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller. Van Eyssen left the management business in 1965 to work at Columbia Pictures' UK division. Two years after his hiring, van Eyssen became the UK studio's Managing Director and was behind some of the studio's most popular British films, including Romeo and Juliet, To Sir With Love (1967), Born Free (1966), Georgy Girl (1966), Oliver! and A Man For All Seasons (1969). In 1969, he was promoted to Worldwide Head of Production (ex-US) and moved to New York. He left the studio in 1974 to work as an independent producer, and in 1981, produced Sidney Lumet's Daniel. Van Eyssen returned to England in 1991 and became an instrumental part of establishing Britain's premiere showcase for talented young filmmakers, the Chelsea Film Festival.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0886881","name":"John Van Eyssen","idIMDB":"nm0886881"},"actorId":"nm0886881","character":"John Maudle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jennifer Daniel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199663","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 May 1936","placeOfBirth":" Pontypool, South Wales, UK","birthName":"Jennifer R.

Unfortunately, WWII radically changed his prospects; conscripted into the army for the duration and wounded at some point around mid to late 1944 which saw him invalided back to England. Shortly after his return home he met a young war widow Barbara; they married and produced four children: John Waters, Angela, Stephen, and Fiona Fizz Waters. The Waters family lived in a rented top floor 2 bedroom flat in Anlaby Road, Teddington, Middlesex close to the Thames TV studios. Russell's career was capricious to say the least, an obviously talented actor, underrated and often overlooked probably due to the vagaries of time and circumstance brought about by the events of WWII.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0914170","name":"Russell Waters","idIMDB":"nm0914170"},"actorId":"nm0914170","character":"Sam Spencer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Trevor Reid","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0717457","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 January 1908","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, England, UK","bio":"Trevor Reid was born on January 25, 1908 in Liverpool, England.
