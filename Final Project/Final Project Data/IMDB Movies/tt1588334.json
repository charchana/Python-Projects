She is of Italian (mother) and English, Irish, Welsh, and German (father) descent. Soon after the 1968 Democratic convention, there was a casting call for a film with several roles for the kind of young people who had disrupted the convention. Two recent graduates of Catholic University in Washington DC, went to the audition in New York for Joe (1970). Chris Sarandon, who had studied to be an actor, was passed over. His wife Susan got a major role. That role was as Susan Compton, the daughter of ad executive Bill Compton (Dennis Patrick). In the movie Dad Bill kills Susan's drug dealer boyfriend and next befriends Joe (Peter Boyle)-- a bigot who works on an assembly line and who collects guns. Five years later, Sarandon made the film where fans of cult classics have come to know her as \"Janet\", who gets entangled with transvestite \"Dr. Frank 'n' Furter\" in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975). More than 15 years after beginning her career Sarandon at last actively campaigned for a great role, Annie in Bull Durham (1988), flying at her own expense from Rome to Los Angeles. \"It was such a wonderful script ... and did away with a lot of myths and challenged the American definition of success\", she said. \"When I got there, I spent some time with Kevin Costner, kissed some ass at the studio and got back on a plane\". Her romance with the Bull Durham (1988) supporting actor, Tim Robbins, had produced two sons by 1992 and put Sarandon in the position of leaving her domestic paradise only to accept roles that really challenged her. The result was four Academy Award nominations in the 1990s and best actress for Dead Man Walking (1995). Her first Academy Award nomination was for Louis Malle's Atlantic City (1980).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4ODMzMDUzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY4NzQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000215","name":"Susan Sarandon","idIMDB":"nm0000215"},"actorId":"nm0000215","character":"Sharon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0295846","main":true},{"actorName":"Judy Greer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339460","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTAyMzMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY2Mzc2NQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 July 1975","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Judith Therese Evans","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Judy Greer was born and raised outside of Detroit, Michigan, as Judith Therese Evans. She is the daughter of Mollie Ann (née Greer), a hospital administrator and former nun, and Richard Evans, a mechanical engineer. She has German, Irish, English, Welsh, and Scottish ancestry. After training for nearly ten years in classical Russian ballet, Greer shifted her interest to acting and was accepted into Chicago's prestigious Theater School at DePaul University. After a variety of odd jobs during college, from telemarketer to oyster shucker, Greer landed her first on-screen role just three days after graduation -- a small part in the Jason Lee-David Schwimmer comedy Kissing a Fool (1998). She flew to Los Angeles for the film's premiere and never left. Greer quickly landed a role in the dark comedy Jawbreaker (1999), with Rose McGowan and Rebecca Gayheart. Greer starred as a school wallflower-turned-babe in a story about high school girls who accidentally kill their best friend and try to cover up the murder. She went on to play a news correspondent in David O. Russell's Three Kings (1999), landing a memorable opening love scene with George Clooney. Her performance caught the eye of Hollywood, and she appeared next in Mike Nichols's What Planet Are You From? (2000) as a flight attendant opposite Garry Shandling. Her television credits include a recurring role as Jason Bateman's assistant Kitty on Fox's Arrested Development (2003), as well as guest-starring roles on Love & Money (1999), Maggie Winters (1998), and Early Edition (1996). Greer starred opposite Jennifer Garner in Columbia Pictures' romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 (2004), directed by Gary Winick. Greer played an office colleague alongside Garner's character, with whom she shares a checkered past. She co-starred in writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's The Village (2004), opposite Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sigourney Weaver, and William Hurt. Set in 1897, the film revolves around a close-knit community that lives with the knowledge that a mythical race of creatures resides in the woods surrounding them. The Village (2004) was released July 30, 2004, by Touchtone Pictures. Greer also co-starred in director Wes Craven's Cursed (2005), a modern twist on the classic werewolf tale written by Kevin Williamson. The busy actress also landed a co-starring role opposite Orlando Bloom and Susan Sarandon in writer-director Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown (2005). Greer will play the sister of Bloom's character and daughter of Sarandon's character. She also joined Jeff Bridges and Jeanne Tripplehorn in the independent film The Amateurs (2005) by writer-director Michael Traeger. The film revolves around a motley group of friends who band together to make an amateur porn film. Greer plays a young temptress at the local mattress store who secures a role in the movie by allowing the store to be used as a film location. Greer wrapped production in New York on a co-starring role opposite Tom McCarthy (\"The Station Agent\") in Danny Leiner's The Great New Wonderful (2005) for Serenade Films/Sly Dog Films. The dark comedy tells five different stories against the backdrop of an uncertain post-September 11 New York. The cast also includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Edie Falco and Tony Shalhoub. She also appeared in writer-director Adam Goldberg's psychological drama I Love Your Work (2003), opposite Giovanni Ribisi. The film is about a fictional movie star (Ribisi) and his gradual meltdown and increasing obsession with a young film student and his girlfriend. The stellar cast also included Franka Potente, Christina Ricci, and Jason Lee and debuted at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. In the film, Greer plays Samantha, the personal assistant of Ribisi's character. Greer had a starring role as the female lead role in the comedy The Hebrew Hammer (2003) as the feisty, fearless Esther, who joins forces with an Orthodox Jewish Blaxploitation hero (Adam Goldberg) to save Hanukkah from an evil son of Santa Claus (Andy Dick). The Hebrew Hammer (2003) debuted at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and premiered on Comedy Central followed by a theatrical release. She also appeared in Adaptation. (2002), from director Spike Jonze. In the film, Nicolas Cage stars as self-loathing writer Charlie Kaufman (and twin brother Donald) as he attempts to adapt the novel \"The Orchid Thief\" for the big screen. Greer played Alice, the waitress with whom he becomes obsessed -- the object of his fantasies. Greer turned in a scene-stealing comedic performance in Un mariage trop parfait (2001), with Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey, in which she played Penny, Lopez's sweet but ditsy assistant who tries hard, but often falls a little short. Equally adept at more dramatic roles, Greer gave a standout performance opposite Mel Gibson in What Women Want (2000), playing a suicidal file clerk rescued by the one man who can hear women's thoughts. Greer's pivotal scene with Gibson is the heart of the film. With a genuine gift for comedy and an engaging on-screen presence, Judy Greer has quickly become one of Hollywood's most captivating young talents. Having appeared in such diverse films as Jawbreaker (1999), What Women Want (2000), Un mariage trop parfait (2001), and Adaptation. (2002), as well as a number of upcoming feature film projects, Greer turns in scene-stealing performances opposite some of the industry's biggest stars.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTAyMzMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY2Mzc2NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339460","name":"Judy Greer","nicknames":["Greer"],"idIMDB":"nm0339460"},"actorId":"nm0339460","character":"Linda","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0295845","main":true},{"actorName":"Rae Dawn Chong","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001044","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NzU5MjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTM1NzA3._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 February 1961","placeOfBirth":" Edmonton, Alberta, Canada","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Rae Dawn Chong was born February 28, 1961 in Edmonton, Canada to Maxine Sneed and Tommy Chong.

He attended Jesuit High School where he first began to act in musicals at the age of sixteen, and went on to New York University where he studied acting and performed in plays. At NYU, Steve garnered a \"Best Actor\" award for his portrayal of the ferocious Irishman, Mr. Maurrant, in Elmer Rice's \"Street Scene.\" After college, Steve continued working in theater, at one point studying puppetry at The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, under the mentoring of Richard Termine of the Henson Foundation and Marty Robinson of Sesame Street (\"Mr. Snuffleupagus,\" \"Telly Monster\"). In 2002, Steve directed his own live-action/puppet adaptation of Peter Shaeffer's \"Amadeus\" for which he received a \"Best Director\" award and the play received a \"Best Drama\" award. Jay Stanley of Vive La Vie! Magazine called the play a \"masterpiece of theatrical genius.\" In 2005, Steve first teamed up with the Duplass Brothers to star in the short film, \"The Intervention.\" The film won the Silver Bear and Teddy Awards at the Berlin Film Festival and the Grand Jury Prize at the GEN ART Film Festival in New York. Steve's relationship with the Duplass Brothers continued as he starred in their horror comedy \"Baghead\" which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was acquired by Sony Pictures Classics. Steve's performance in \"Baghead\" caught the attention of critics and casting directors, and Steve went on to do work on TV shows such as \"The Office,\" \"Parks and Recreations,\" and FX's \"The League.\" In 2009, Steve would collaborate with the Duplass Brothers again by starring in their epic, sibling rivalry sports film \"The Dodeca Pentathlon.\" The film played at several film festivals including SXSW and was acquired by Fox Searchlight. In 2011, Steve played a supporting role in the Duplass Brothers second studio feature \"Jeff, Who Lives at Home\" along side Jason Segel, Ed Helms, and Judy Greer.

It will air in early 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMTMyNjA3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyOTIzNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1587813","name":"Steve Zissis","idIMDB":"nm1587813"},"actorId":"nm1587813","character":"Steve","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0367770","main":true},{"actorName":"Evan Ross","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1963091","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMzQwMzQ4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTExOTkzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 August 1988","placeOfBirth":" Greenwich, Connecticut, USA","birthName":"Evan Olav Næss","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Evan Ross was born on August 26, 1988 in Greenwich, Connecticut, USA as Evan Olav Næss.

Nichols plays the dentist 'Larry Williams', supportive and devoted husband to 'LaDonna Baptiste-Williams' (Khandi Alexander) and loving father to his two stepchildren. Born in the 12th ward of New Orleans, Nichols grew up attending McDonough 35 and remained in the city through his college years, attending the University of New Orleans in 1973. Having begun as a pre-med major, Nichols knew quickly that this was not his calling. A freshman drama class spurred his decision to change his major, which resulted in a GPA jump and a Bachelors degree in Dramatic Arts and Communications. After attending a national dramatic audition for graduate studies, Nichols was offered entrance into seven different programs. Budget cuts eventually made it impossible for him to attend, however, and he remised to manual labor work, loading trucks for UPS. Not one to give up on his true passion for acting, Nichols made the decision to move to Los Angeles in 1978 where he quickly landed his first on-screen gig on the widely popular game show \"The Dating Game.\" Though love never sparked for him on the show, following his appearance he was fortunate enough to run into another New Orleans native at a Baskin Robbins, whom he married less than a year later. Today, after 31 years of marriage and three children, the couple are still going strong, having battled the plight of Hurricane Katrina not only on the small screen of TREME but also in real life as a working family. Nichols is most widely known for his role as the preacher in the 2008 Academy Award nominated film, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, alongside Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Following the success of this role, Nichols landed a part in the Warner Bros. summer blockbuster THE CAMPAIGN (2012), starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. Throughout his 30+ years of acting, spanning from the early 80s to present day, Nichols has made over 75 appearances on multiple award winning and critically acclaimed television series including: CHEERS, MURDER SHE WROTE, MATLOCK, EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES. After a long stint in Los Angeles pursuing his passion, Nichols returned to his roots in New Orleans where he landed a role close to his heart - his current role on TREME. Nichols is currently filming the fourth and final season of TREME and has recently wrapped filming on the feature film adaptation of BEAUTIFUL CREATURES alongside Academy Award nominee Viola Davis and Academy Award winning actress Emma Thompson. When he's not on set, Nichols and wife Zardis stay busy operating Lanzardis Productions, their company that specializes in acting and dialogue coaching. In his free time, Nichols can be found at home in New Orleans with his wife and kids, most likely at a Saints game cheering his team to victory.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMTMwNTQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ1OTExMTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0629634","name":"Lance E.
