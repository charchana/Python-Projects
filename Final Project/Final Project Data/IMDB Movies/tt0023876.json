Starring opposite the great Anton Walbrook, she played the part of terrorized Bella Mallen (driven to the point of insanity by her evil husband) with an ethereal, haunted fragility. Diana Wynyard was educated at the Woodford School in Croydon and first appeared on the stage in London in 1925, debuting in 'Sorry, You've been Troubled' as Lady Sheridan. She soon became one of the great stars of the British theatre with a wide-ranging repertoire, which included Shakespeare, Chekhov and Shaw. In 1937, she played Eliza Doolittle in 'Pygmalion'. In 1932, she was signed to a contract at MGM and was cast opposite the three Barrymores in Rasputin and the Empress (1932). However, her best performance was with Clive Brook in Noël Coward's Cavalcade (1933), for which she received an Academy Award nomination. The New York Times (June 6, 1933) remarked, \"Miss Wynyard is excellent as Jane Marryot. She portrays her role with such sympathy and feeling that one scarcely thinks of her as an actress\". Another review of Diana Wynyard, this time for One More River (1934), described her acting as 'stirringly sincere'. Her Hollywood career lasted only two years before the actress returned to England. She gave other sensitive performances in The Prime Minister (1941), with John Gielgud as Benjamin Disraeli, and The Remarkable Mr. Kipps (1941), with Michael Redgrave, both directed by Carol Reed. Her subsequent marriage to Reed lasted just four years. Diana Wynyard appeared in smaller supporting roles during the 1950s and, in keeping with her confession \"I don't really want to be a film star\", gradually returned to the Shakespearean stage. One of her last significant screen roles was as James Mason's mother in Island in the Sun (1957). On stage, she played Beatrice, first opposite Anthony Quayle and later John Gielgud, in 'Much ado about nothing' (Australian tour, 1949-50). Other parts included Katherine in 'The Taming of the Shrew' and Hermione in 'The Winter's Tale'. Diana was awarded a CBE in 1953 for her contribution to the theatre. She never stopped working and gave her final performance as Gertrude to Peter O'Toole's Hamlet.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzhmMzZiYzQtYjgwYi00NGQ3LWI1ZWMtZWZkYjgxMzZiYjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0944087","name":"Diana Wynyard","idIMDB":"nm0944087"},"actorId":"nm0944087","character":"Jane Marryot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0482068","main":true},{"actorName":"Clive Brook","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111612","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3MjgwOTQ5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg5NDQ3MTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 June 1887","placeOfBirth":" Tufnell Park, London, England, UK","birthName":"Clifford Hardman Brook","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Born in London, England to Charlotte Mary (opera singer) and George Alfred Brook.

She was born Ursula Jean McMinn in India, schooled in London and trained for acting at RADA. Ursula made her theatrical debut at the Criterion Theatre in 1922. From the 1930's, she specialised in classical plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, performing primarily at the Old Vic and with the Sadler's Wells Company. During World War II, she worked under the auspices of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), along with her second husband, the actor Roger Livesey. They often appeared together on stage and enjoyed a particularly successful run on the West End in a play written specifically for them by J.B. Priestley: \"Ever Since Paradise\". In the late 1950's, the Liveseys toured Australia and New Zealand in \"The Reluctant Debutante\". On screen, they had previously appeared in both the stage and screen versions of The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943). Ursula's relatively few film roles generally saw her as genteel, devoted wives, like her Mrs. Molly Wallis in The Dam Busters (1955). She was rather more effective, however, as the officer's wife Lady Windham in North West Frontier (1959), or as the middle-class widow Martha Dacre, coming to terms with the aftermath of the war in The Weaker Sex (1948).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzE2NDQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNjA1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419982","name":"Ursula Jeans","idIMDB":"nm0419982"},"actorId":"nm0419982","character":"Fanny Bridges","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Margaret Lindsay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512267","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MjY5MDExN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgyNjU2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1910","placeOfBirth":" Dubuque, Iowa, USA","birthName":"Margaret Kies","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Picture-pretty brunette Margaret Lindsay was one of a number of pleasant, sweet-natured ingénues who could do no wrong in a score of 1930s stylish Hollywood pictures. Such altruistic love interests were often overlooked in pictures that were carried by the flashy histrionics of a jaunty James Cagney or temperamental Bette Davis, both of whom she supported in several films. Ergo, while she was a lovely distraction and a highly capable talent, Margaret failed to ignite and command the attention of a truer star. The Dubuque, Iowa-born lovely was christened Margaret Kies in real life, the eldest of six (she had four sisters (Helen, Jane, Lori, Mickie), one brother (Jack)). Her father, a druggist, enrolled her at the National Park Seminary in Washington, DC. The acting bug hit Margaret quite early, however, and she subsequently attended New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts to pursue her dream. Unable to find work in New York, she traveled to England for further speech and acting study. Here she made her professional stage debut and gained experience and confidence in such plays as \"Escape,\" \"By Candlelight,\" and \"Death Takes a Holiday\". With her resume now consisting of strong theatre credits, she returned to the States hoping to finally make a mark on Broadway, but again her career stalled. While waiting for a show of hers to open following production delays (eventually she co-starred on Broadway opposite Roland Young in \"Another Love Story\"), Margaret had a number of screen tests arranged for her. Shelving her Iowa-based roots, Universal took an interest in the \"British stage actress\" and signed her on. She made her debut in Okay America! (1932) and toiled in a few minor roles before taking full advantage of her \"English tea rose\" reputation with a small but noticeable part in the \"all-British\" grand-scale epic film Cavalcade (1933) as an optimistic honeymooner on board the fateful H.M.S.Titanic. Warner Bros. then picked up her option and began featuring her gracefully opposite such magnanimous stars as Leslie Howard, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., George Arliss and Humphrey Bogart. \"Americanized\" as a lead and second lead, she was able to drop the British pretense and appeared opposite Cagney in Lady Killer (1933), Devil Dogs of the Air (1935), Frisco Kid (1935) and 'G' Men (1935). The studio had her work as a second-lead to Ms. Davis as well in such films as Fog Over Frisco (1934) and Bordertown (1935). Of note, she supported Davis in both her Oscar-winning \"Best Actress\" pictures -- Dangerous (1935) and Jezebel (1938). She also took on a Davis castoff role in Garden of the Moon (1938), a musical in which Margaret did not sing. Margaret's longstanding problem was that she was either involved in minor pictures that would do nothing to advance her career or was handed oblique secondary roles in \"A\" pictures wherein she played the star's best friend, light romantic rival or socialite. One of Margaret's sisters, Jane Gilbert was briefly an actress in the late 1930s/early '40s and was once married to Perry Mason (1957) co-star William Hopper, who played private investigator Paul Drake. Following one of her best roles as Hepzibah in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables (1940), Margaret signed up with Columbia in the recurring \"Ellery Queen\" series (seven in all) as mystery writer Nikki Porter opposite either Ralph Bellamy or William Gargan's title crime solver. Probably her best remembered role, this renewed popularity did not guarantee \"A\" pictures and she remained for the most part in second tier filming. One of her more atypical roles came as a man-baiting saloon girl in The Vigilantes Return (1947). In the 1940s, she replenished her film resume with secondary ladylike roles behind Joan Bennett in Scarlet Street (1945), Lana Turner in Cass Timberlane (1947) and Barbara Stanwyck in B.F.'s Daughter (1948). Margaret also sought work on TV and on the legit stage in the next decade. Her final film was in typically pleasant mode as Nurse Colman in Tammy and the Doctor (1963) showcasing a nubile Sandra Dee. Margaret never married in real life but remained close to her family. Her dating companions were typically \"safe\" stars such as Cesar Romero, Richard Deacon, and even Liberace. For much of her time in Hollywood, Margaret shared a home with a close sister. She died at age 70 in Los Angeles of emphysema in the spring of 1981.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MjY5MDExN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgyNjU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512267","name":"Margaret Lindsay","idIMDB":"nm0512267"},"actorId":"nm0512267","character":"Edith Harris","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Warburton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0911314","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE1YTVkMDQtZWYzOC00ODBhLThiZmItZjYxZmNhZDUzNmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 June 1899","placeOfBirth":" Maghull, Liverpool, England, UK","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"John Warburton was born on June 18, 1899 in Maghull, Liverpool, England.
