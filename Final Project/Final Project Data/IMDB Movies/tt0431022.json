She has been active in the entertainment industry for well over a decade, and has worked both in front of the camera and for live audiences. She grew up doing live singing and dance performances for the Hungarian community in the upper east side of Manhattan. It was through those experiences and through working on the movie Finding Forrester as part of her high school advanced chorus that she developed a serious interest in entertainment and art. She graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, following in the footsteps of other well known individuals in entertainment, such as Stan Lee, Tracy Morgan, and Ralph Lauren. Sybelle has appeared in shows such as 30 Rock, Law and Order and The Whitest Kids U'Know. She worked alongside Christina Calph (Arthur, Tower Heist) in her web series Diary of a Hot College Chick and co-starred opposite Erin Brown aka Misty Mundae (CSI) in the horror comedy The New York Butcher. She had a supporting role in the feature film Monsters of Mulberry Street (Eric Roberts, Lillo Brancato) and starring roles in the short films Sarina, The Addict, Checkout, and Gaia. In 2002, she modeled for the August issue of Honey Magazine, and that autumn, won second place in the Gothic Beauty Pageant, organized by photographer John Santerineross. She represented Hungary in the Miss Diaspora Models International Beauty Competition in December of 2010, and won Miss Popularity in the Miss Hungary in America Pageant in March 2012. She has since gone on to model for various fashion designers, including Sazie Rahman, Pearl Naidoo, and Citra Gala of Citrolina. A space exploration and astronomy enthusiast, Sybelle applied for the Mars One space mission to colonize the red planet. Over 200,000 applications were received in the summer of 2013 when the program first opened it's doors. Sybelle became an astronaut finalist for the program, one out of only 1,000 to be selected, and remained present till the Round 3 selection process. To have been selected was no small feat. Her self taught skills as a computer technician over the course of 2 decades and being trilingual earned her a spot among the initial finalists. She still supports the program and is fully committed to the idea that humans should become a multi-planetary species in her lifetime. Sybelle briefly returned to work on music as the lead singer of short lived 80s style rock band Kings Valentine. She has been featured in various known media outlets, such as Fox News, Vice's Motherboard, and Buzzfeed, to name a few. VH1 named her number 9 on a list of 50 Celebrities whose names sound like Game of Thrones characters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2YjRhMTctN2Q1OC00NzU5LWFjMTYtZTBlYWQ3NTI5MzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2655690","name":"Sybelle Silverphoenix","nicknames":["Phoenix","Silver"],"idIMDB":"nm2655690"},"actorId":"nm2655690","character":"Anne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bob Hands-Off","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5336640","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Bob Hands-Off is an actor, known for Dirtbags (2002).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5336640","name":"Bob Hands-Off","idIMDB":"nm5336640"},"actorId":"nm5336640","character":"The Cop","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Steele","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1627592","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 January 1962","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Petrus T.
