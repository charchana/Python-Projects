At the age of one, Shannyn and her family moved to a new locale: Reno, Nevada. Her youth was spent at a dance studio. In 1995, she left her hometown the day after graduating from Galena High School, for Los Angeles, to pursue dance. She started deejaying as a hobby with her then boyfriend in the local clubs around town. Paying her bills every month were her appearances in commercials. Acting was not high on the young dancer's priority list, aside from a series of commercials, not for lack of interest but for the fact that she was content with her life in L.A. as it was. It was in 1999, when Shannyn was helping a friend D.J. at a birthday party for Gwyneth Paltrow that a new chapter began in her fairy tale life. Francine Maisler, a casting director known for such films as The Usual Suspects (1995), spotted Shannyn. Shortly thereafter Shannyn found herself with the backing of an influential Hollywood name and one very important audition... A Knight's Tale (2001). She determined she wanted the lead role and after six call backs, beat out the competition to play \"Lady Jocelyn\". Admittedly, the dancer turned actress knew little of her Australian costar Heath Ledger but the two became friends during filming. Since then, she appeared in the independent features Road to Nowhere (2010), directed by Monte Hellman and Man Without a Head for director Johnny Roc, as well as in Wristcutters: A Love Story (2006), with Patrick Fugit and Tom Waits, 40 Days and 40 Nights (2002) opposite Josh Hartnett, and The Rules of Attraction (2002) for director Roger Avary. Other credits include Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), Life Is Hot in Cracktown (2009) and The Holiday (2006).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyNDIwODI3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0NDIzOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0815370","name":"Shannyn Sossamon","nicknames":["Shan"],"idIMDB":"nm0815370"},"actorId":"nm0815370","character":"Victoria","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0100979","main":true},{"actorName":"Pink","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600877","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxMzE0MDg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc2MjYxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 September 1979","placeOfBirth":" Doylestown, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Alecia Beth Moore","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Pink was born Alecia Beth Moore in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, and was later raised in Philadelphia. Her parents, Judith Moore (née Kugel), a nurse, and Jim Moore, a Vietnam veteran, divorced when she was very young. Her mother is from an Ashkenazi Jewish family, while her father has Irish, German, and English ancestry. As a child, all Pink wanted was to become a singer, and she was driven by the music of Madonna, Mary J. Blige, 4 Non Blondes, Janis Joplin, Billy Joel and Whitney Houston. Pink was a very unique teenager, and went through phases as a skateboarder, hip-hopper and gymnast. She spent several years as part of the club scene in Philadelphia, singing guest spots and performing for talent shows. At the age of 13, she was asked by a local DJ to sing back-up for his rap group, Schools of Thought. A short time later, she was discovered by a record executive and joined a female R&B group, Choice. When that didn't work out, she signed with LaFace Records and began her solo career. In spring 2000, she released her debut, \"Can't Take Me Home\". She co-wrote many songs and watched it go multi-platinum by the year's end. Her debut included the Top 10 hit, \"There You Go\", which was certified a gold single.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxMzE0MDg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc2MjYxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600877","name":"Pink","idIMDB":"nm0600877"},"actorId":"nm0600877","character":"Carolyn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0045572","main":true},{"actorName":"Emil Hostina","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1118408","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM2NTk0NDI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI2MzAyNjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Emil Hostina is an actor, known for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), The Fall (2006) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM2NTk0NDI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI2MzAyNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1118408","name":"Emil Hostina","idIMDB":"nm1118408"},"actorId":"nm1118408","character":"Henry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sandi Dragoi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2880957","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Sandi Dragoi is an actress, known for Catacombs (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2880957","name":"Sandi Dragoi","idIMDB":"nm2880957"},"actorId":"nm2880957","character":"Llaves","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mihai Stanescu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0822131","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Mihai Stanescu is known for his work on Train of Life (1998), Little Ghost (1997) and Leeches!

Reading about things like blue jeans, chocolate or sodas in books and dictionaries, he never saw them in real life until long after the fall of communism in 1989. Even during such hard times, Cain's love for acting was able to blossom. As a child, he would be in every kindergarten and school play and even organize little shows with other children for their neighbors. As time went by, this love for acting and theater morphed into a love of film and soon Cain found himself quite a movie buff, watching movie after movie on the translated videocassettes that appeared on the Romanian market. Years later, having studied English extensively, and due to his extracurricular work, he enrolled at the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, New Hampshire, where he took his first acting classes and directed his first play, Christopher Durang's \"The Living Room\". He then went on to act in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's \"The School for Scandal\", as the vicious Joseph Surface, and in Tom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\" as title character Rosencrantz. He then moved to Boston, where he chose advertising as his major, a field of study close to the entertainment industry but not really part of it. In the summer break preceding his junior year, while back at home in Bucharest, he simply walked in the offices of a local record company (Sony Music Romania) demanding a meeting with the A&R director, who happened to be the head of the company himself. He offered Cain a contract on the spot, and a year later, he released \"All She Wants Is The Money\", the title track from \"Break The Game Rules\", his debut album. The hot video, featuring a simulated sex orgy between male and female Romanian top-models (with Cain in the center, of course), created a lot of buzz, and the young artist began showing up in a plethora of different local TV shows. Just one year later, after putting music on pause due to contractual issues, he attended the casting for \"Return of the Living Dead\" movies, in which he was supposed to read for the part of Zeke, but having already done the \"bad boy\" thing in his musical career, he decided to try for the more laid-back funny-man Jeremy. Ever since completing \"Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave\", Cain has been the co-host of a TV show called \"I'd Do Anything\", and has filmed a large supporting role in the upcoming thriller \"Catacombs\", starring Pink.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMjY2NzAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0NTQ1OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1653234","name":"Cain Manoli","idIMDB":"nm1653234"},"actorId":"nm1653234","character":"Leon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"DJ Kosta","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2881109","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"DJ Kosta is an actor, known for Catacombs (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2881109","name":"DJ Kosta","idIMDB":"nm2881109"},"actorId":"nm2881109","character":"DJ","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0100985","main":true},{"actorName":"Marcel Cobzariu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168036","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Marcel Cobzariu is an actor, known for Beowulf (1999), Catacombs (2007) and California Dreamin' (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168036","name":"Marcel Cobzariu","idIMDB":"nm0168036"},"actorId":"nm0168036","character":"Customs Officer #1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marinela Chelaru","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1171799","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Marinela Chelaru is an actress, known for The Rest is Silence (2007), Catacombs (2007) and Maria (2003).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1171799","name":"Marinela Chelaru","idIMDB":"nm1171799"},"actorId":"nm1171799","character":"Customs Officer #2","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Catalin Rotaru","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1532856","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Catalin Rotaru is an actor, known for Catacombs (2007) and Vlad (2003).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1532856","name":"Catalin Rotaru","idIMDB":"nm1532856"},"actorId":"nm1532856","character":"Customs Officer #3","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tomm Coker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1870127","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1972","placeOfBirth":" Sacramento, California, USA","birthName":"Thomas Lewis Coker","bio":"Tomm Coker was born on November 3, 1972 in Sacramento, California, USA as Thomas Lewis Coker.
