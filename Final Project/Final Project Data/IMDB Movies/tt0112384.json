His father had English and some German, ancestry, while his mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. Ron Howard was working on Splash (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation. In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay. Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy _That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwNDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2NDY3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158","name":"Tom Hanks","idIMDB":"nm0000158"},"actorId":"nm0000158","character":"Jim Lovell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005115","main":true},{"actorName":"Bill Paxton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000200","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2NTQwOTAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNjYwMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 May 1955","placeOfBirth":" Fort Worth, Texas, USA","birthName":"William Paxton","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Bill Paxton was born on May 17, 1955 in Fort Worth, Texas.

He made his film debut in the Corman film Crazy Mama (1975), directed by Jonathan Demme. Moving to New York, Paxton studied acting under Stella Adler at New York University. After landing a small role in Stripes (1981), he found steady work in low-budget films and television. He also directed, wrote and produced award-winning short films including Fish Heads (1980), which aired on Saturday Night Live (1975). His first appearance in a James Cameron film was a small role in The Terminator (1984), followed by his very memorable performance as Private Hudson in Aliens (1986) and as the nomadic vampire Severen in Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark (1987). Bill also appeared in John Hughes' Weird Science (1985), as Wyatt Donnelly's sadistic older brother Chet. Although he continued to work steadily in film and television, his big break did not come until his lead role in the critically acclaimed film-noir One False Move (1992). This quickly led to strong supporting roles as Wyatt Earp's naive younger brother Morgan in Tombstone (1993) and as Fred Haise, one of the three astronauts, in Apollo 13 (1995), as well as in James Cameron's offering True Lies (1994).

(Alsip) and Robert L. Sinise, A.C.E., a film editor. He is of Italian (from his paternal grandfather), English, Scottish, Irish, French, German, and Swedish ancestry. His family moved to Highland Park, where he attended high school. He was something of a rebel, playing in bands but paying little attention to school. Gary and some friends tried out for \"West Side Story\" as a lark, but Gary was hooked on acting for life by closing night. Gary credits his love for theatre to his drama teacher, Barbara Patterson. In 1974, Gary, Terry Kinney, and Jeff Perry founded the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. Initially performing in a church basement, the company grew and gained stature in the Chicago area. In addition to acting in many plays, Gary also directed some of Steppenwolf's most notable productions, including Sam Shepard's \"True West\". The company made its off-Broadway debut with that production, starring Gary and John Malkovich, and its Broadway debut with \"The Grapes of Wrath\" at the Cort Theatre in 1990. Gary's Hollywood career also started in the director's chair with two episodes of the stylish TV series Crime Story (1986), followed in 1988 by the feature Miles from Home (1988) starring Richard Gere. Gary's first feature film as an actor was the World War II fable A Midnight Clear (1992) in 1992. That year also found Gary combining his acting and directing talents with the critically acclaimed Of Mice and Men (1992). His first real notice by the public came in 1994, however. He starred in the blockbuster miniseries The Stand (1994), rapidly followed by his bravura performance as \"Lt. Dan\" in Forrest Gump (1994). His portrayal of the disabled, emotionally tortured veteran earned Gary numerous awards and an Oscar nomination. Busy 1994 was followed by busy 1995, first reuniting with Tom Hanks in Apollo 13 (1995) and then starring in the HBO film Truman (1995) which earned him the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards and an Emmy nomination. Gary is married to Moira Sinise, an actress and original member of the Steppenwolf company. They have three children, Sophie Sinise, McCanna Anthony Sinise and Ella Sinise.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE4NzcyMzU3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM2NDE2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000641","name":"Gary Sinise","idIMDB":"nm0000641"},"actorId":"nm0000641","character":"Ken Mattingly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005118","main":true},{"actorName":"Ed Harris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000438","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NDM4ODc2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5NjQ5MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 November 1950","placeOfBirth":" Tenafly, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Edward Allen Harris","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"By transforming into his characters and pulling the audience in, Ed Harris has earned the reputation as one of the most talented actors of our time.

He scored his first acting role at the age of eight, as the child version of Steve Martin's character, Gil Buckman, in director Ron Howard's hit comedy Parenthood (1989). The following year, he took a role in the short-lived Parenthood (1990) TV series (alongside young Leonardo DiCaprio and Thora Birch), this time playing Gil Buckman's son, Kevin. Max is perhaps best known for his role as Colt in the children's martial arts films 3 Ninjas (1992), 3 Ninjas Kick Back (1994)and 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up (1995). He had studied karate since the age of five and this role provided an opportunity for his acting and martial arts talents to come together. He was the only actor to appear in all three films, his co-stars Michael Treanor and Chad Power having declined to appear in 'Kick Back.' ('Kick Back' and 'Knuckle Up' were released out of order.) At the age of fourteen, Max worked with Ron Howard for the third time, this time as Tom Hanks' screen son in Apollo 13 (1995). Working on this film was a profoundly inspirational experience for Max; he was particularly struck by Tom Hanks' uncommon level of dedication and focus. Stepping off the high-budget film set of Apollo 13 (1995), Max took on the final role of his child acting career in an independent action film entitled The Sweeper (1996). This role was, in many ways, his most challenging, as it required him to deliver an emotionally-charged performance during a fast-paced shooting schedule. At the age of fifteen, Max decided to take an extended leave-of-absence from the acting business in order to focus on school, going on to earn a B.A. in anthropology from USC. He has also found time to focus on music, which he has been passionate about since his child acting days. He currently teaches yoga in Pasadena, California. After more than a decade of discovering new interests, Max has decided the time is right to re-enter the film industry as an adult.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzczMTAzNzkwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM0NjgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0805189","name":"Max Elliott Slade","idIMDB":"nm0805189"},"actorId":"nm0805189","character":"Jay Lovell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0042078","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean Speegle Howard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397362","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NTUyNzgzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY1MjYxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 January 1927","placeOfBirth":" Duncan, Oklahoma, USA","birthName":"Jean Frances Speegle","bio":"Jean Speegle Howard was born on January 31, 1927 in Duncan, Oklahoma, USA as Jean Frances Speegle.

After becoming a member of the California bar and practicing law for a short time, he took what he calls a \"hard right\", deciding to leave the legal profession for an acting career. Now a 35-year industry veteran, David Andrews has worked with some of Hollywood's top directors and Oscar-winning actors, and has been singled out by critics for his work on both stage and screen. A highly versatile actor and consummate professional, David's roles have run the gamut in films such as World War Z, Apollo 13, Fight Club, Hannibal, Walk to Remember, The Conspirator, Cherry 2000, and Fair Game, in which he was singled out for his powerful portrayal of Scooter Libby. On television, David has starred as a series regular on JAG, The Monroes, Mann & Machine, The Antagonist, HBO's 12 Miles of Bad Road, and the BBC's Pulaski, for which he received an ACE Award nomination for Best Actor in the title role. In addition to a very long list of guest starring roles, David has recurred on numerous series: Netflix' hit series House of Cards, Justified, Murder in the First, The Catch, Crisis, The Whispers, Necessary Roughness, CSI, Covert Affairs, Brothers and Sisters, Surface, Dragnet, and Murder One. He is currently recurring as Sam Vincent on USA's soon-to-be released series Shooter. MOW/mini-series projects, to name just a few, include HBO's Band of Brothers and From the Earth to the Moon, for which he earned a SAG Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance and critical acclaim for his performance as astronaut Frank Borman. David recently finished co-writing his second feature film script, Bushido, a action/adventure tale of self discovery set in Japan amidst the chaos and destruction of the final days of WWII.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzODM0OTQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMyNTQ5NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0028625","name":"David Andrews","nicknames":["Wheels"],"idIMDB":"nm0028625"},"actorId":"nm0028625","character":"Pete Conrad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0042082","main":true},{"actorName":"Michele Little","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0514633","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"Michelle Inez Little","bio":"Michele Little was born as Michelle Inez Little.
