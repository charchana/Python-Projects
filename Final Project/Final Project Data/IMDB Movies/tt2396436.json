He has since appeared on 'Satisfaction', 'Carla Cametti PD' and 'Offspring' working opposite popular local talents Brooke Satchwell, Asher Keddie and Kat Stewart. After years of extensive training with the likes of Richard Sarell (The Rehearsal Room) and Bruce Alexander (Melbourne Acting Studio), Nicholas won 'best actor' for his performance in Carl J. Sorheim's stage play 'It's all the Rage' at Melbourne Short and Sweet 2009. This rewarded him a place as one of the lead actors on the 'Shorter and Sweeter' national tour (funded by Regional Arts Victoria), which toured Australia, visiting major states such as South Australia, Canberra & NSW to sold out shows. In 2009, he was cast as one of the lead actors in 'The Dream Children'. This groundbreaking Australian feature film follows the story of Alex Thomson (Nicholas Gunn) and Steven Evans (Graeme Squires), a same-sex couple who desire to further their love by secretly raising a family. This controversial film premiered at the Melbourne Queer Festival in March 2015 to a sell-out crowd. The reception received was exceptional and prompted the MQFF to give the film a second screening. This sold out within a couple of days. Their distributors, Media Lunar Films, have successfully managed to secure screenings in both Europe and the United States in 2015. In recent times, Nicholas has top billing in the Australian feature film 'Lemon Tree Passage', where he stars opposite Jess Tovey ('Wonderland'), Tim Pocock ('Camp!') and Andy Ryan ('INXS: Never Tear Us Apart'). 'Lemon Tree Passage' has secured top tier distributor Universal Studios and had its premiere at UK'S FrightFest in October 2014. It is expected to have a Blu-Ray release in 2015. Nicholas has been starring on the hit soap program 'Neighbours' as regular guest 'Forrest Jones'.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NjA5Mzk3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEyMTg2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3238882","name":"Nicholas Gunn","idIMDB":"nm3238882"},"actorId":"nm3238882","character":"Sam","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pippa Black","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1569147","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNTU1MzA5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3OTMzNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1982","placeOfBirth":" Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Pippa Black (born 16 October 1982) is an Australian actress.
