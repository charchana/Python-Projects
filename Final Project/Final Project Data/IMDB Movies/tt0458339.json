He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lisa (Capuano), who worked at the Concord Youth Theater, and G. Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is congressman Mike Capuano. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theater, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute. On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on The Fugitive (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Cherry Falls (2000) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Not Another Teen Movie (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen. After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Just Married (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, The Perfect Score (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Cellular (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Cellular (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four (2005), 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies. The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. The Nanny Diaries (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie Street Kings (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTg1OTQzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIyMjkyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262635","name":"Chris Evans","nicknames":["Cevans"],"idIMDB":"nm0262635"},"actorId":"nm0262635","character":"Captain America / Steve Rogers","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001375","main":true},{"actorName":"Hayley Atwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2017943","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmFiNWZlZDktMTY0NS00MDJjLWIxYzUtYzRhOTc2ZTQxYzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzM0MjE0NDk@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 April 1982","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Hayley Elizabeth Atwell","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Born in London, England, Hayley Elizabeth Atwell has dual citizenship of the United Kingdom and the United States.

Jones, who worked on oil fields. Tommy himself worked in underwater construction and on an oil rig. He attended St. Mark's School of Texas, a prestigious prep school for boys in Dallas, on a scholarship, and went to Harvard on another scholarship. He roomed with future Vice President Al Gore and played offensive guard in the famous 29-29 Harvard-Yale football game of '68 known as \"The Tie.\" He received a B.A. in English literature and graduated cum laude from Harvard in 1969. Following college, he moved to New York and began his theatrical career on Broadway in \"A Patriot for Me\" (1969). In 1970, he made his film debut in Love Story (1970). While living in New York, he continued to appear in various plays, both on- and off-Broadway: \"Fortune and Men's Eyes\" (1969); \"Four on a Garden\" (1971); \"Blue Boys\" (1972); \"Ulysses in Nighttown\" (1974). During this time, he also appeared on a daytime soap opera, One Life to Live (1968) as Dr. Mark Toland from 1971-75. He moved with wife Kate Lardner, granddaughter of short-story writer/columnist Ring Lardner, and her two children from a previous marriage, to Los Angeles. There he began to get some roles on television: Charlie's Angels (1976) (pilot episode); Smash-Up on Interstate 5 (1976); and The Amazing Howard Hughes (1977). While working on the movie Back Roads (1981), he met and fell in love with Kimberlea Cloughley, whom he later married. More roles in television--both on network and cable--stage and film garnered him a reputation as a strong, explosive, thoughtful actor who could handle supporting as well as leading roles. He made his directorial debut in The Good Old Boys (1995) on TNT. In addition to directing and starring in the film, he co-wrote the teleplay (with J.T. Allen). The film, based on Elmer Kelton's novel, is set in west Texas where Jones has strong family ties. Consequently, this story of a cowboy facing the end of an era has special meaning for him.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjc4MDc0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc5OTUwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","nicknames":["TLJ","Tom"],"idIMDB":"nm0000169"},"actorId":"nm0000169","character":"Colonel Chester Phillips","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0204255","main":true},{"actorName":"Hugo Weaving","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915989","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzAyNDQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM4ODcxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 April 1960","placeOfBirth":" Ibadan, Nigeria","birthName":"Hugo Wallace Weaving","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Hugo Wallace Weaving was born on April 4, 1960 in Nigeria, to English parents Anne (Lennard), a tour guide and teacher, and Wallace Weaving, a seismologist. Hugo has an older brother, Simon, and a younger sister, Anna, who both also live and work in Australia. During his early childhood, the Weaving family spent most of their time traveling between Nigeria, Great Britain, and Australia. This was due to the cross-country demands of his father's job in the computer industry. Later, during his teens, Hugo spent three years in England in the seventies attending Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School in Bristol. There, he showed early promise in theater productions and also excelled at history, achieving an A in his O-level examination. He arrived permanently in Australia in 1976 and finished his education at Knox Grammar School, Sydney. He graduated from NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), a college well-known for other alumni such as Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush, in 1981. Since then, Hugo has had a steadily successful career in the film, television, and theater industries. However, he has illustrated that, as renowned as he is known for his film work, he feels most at home on stage and continually performs in Australian theater productions, usually with the Sydney Theater Company. With his success has also come extensive recognition. He has won numerous awards, including two Australian Film Institute Awards (AFI) for Best Actor in a Leading Role and three total nominations. The AFI is the Australian equivalent of an Academy Award, and Hugo won for his performances in Proof (1991) and The Interview (1998). He was also nominated for his performance in Priscilla, folle du désert (1994). He garnered the Best Acting prize for The Interview (1998) at the Montreal Film Festival in 1998 in addition to his AFI Award and, that same year, won the Australian Star of the Year. More recently, roles in films such as The Matrix trilogy as Agent Smith and The Lord of the Rings trilogy as Lord Elrond have considerably raised his international profile. His famous and irreplaceable role in The Matrix movies have made him one of the greatest sci-fi villains of the Twenty-first Century. With each new film, television, or theatrical role, Hugo continues to surpass his audience's expectations and remains one of the most versatile performers working today. He resides in Australia and has two children with partner Katrina Greenwood. Though Hugo and Katrina have never married, they've been a committed couple for over 25 years; while Hugo was quoted as saying marriage \"petrified\" him in the 1990s, by middle of the following decade he said he no longer felt that way, and that he and Katrina have toyed with the idea of marrying \"when we're really old\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMzAyNDQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM4ODcxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915989","name":"Hugo Weaving","idIMDB":"nm0915989"},"actorId":"nm0915989","character":"Johann Schmidt / Red Skull","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0267309","main":true},{"actorName":"Dominic Cooper","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1002641","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2OTk2NDc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNzc4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 June 1978","placeOfBirth":" Greenwich, London, England, UK","birthName":"Dominic Edward Cooper","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Dominic Edward Cooper was born and raised in Greenwich, London, England.

Naturally, his career began on the stage (and continues there), but film and television roles came soon after his studies. Toby made his film debut with a small role in Sally Potter's experimental take on Virginia Woolf's novel, Orlando (1992), starring Tilda Swinton. Other small film roles included the doorkeeper in Les Misérables (1998) and a memorable turn as the Royal Page in Ever After: A Cinderella Story (1998) with Drew Barrymore. Roles in the acclaimed Victoria & Albert (2001) and the Helen Mirren-starring Elizabeth I (2005) were balanced with film work, from his voice role as Dobby the House Elf in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) to supporting appearances in Ladies in Lavender (2004) (co-starring his father, Freddie), Finding Neverland (2004), and Mrs Henderson Presents (2005). He continued stage work during this period, appearing on Broadway in The Play What I Wrote in 2003, a year after winning the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in the London production. Infamous (2006), directed by Douglas McGrath and released in 2006, was Toby's first starring role. His acclaimed portrayal of Truman Capote remained mostly in the shadow of Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning performance of the author in 2005's Capote (2005). A steady stream of film roles followed with appearances in Amazing Grace (2006), Le voile des illusions (2006), Nightwatching (2007), The Mist (2007), and St. Trinian's (2007). Toby then appeared in three successive films that could have been commercial breakthroughs: kid-lit flop City of Ember (2008), the Oscar-nominated Frost/Nixon (2008), and Oliver Stone's W. (2008). He reprised the voice-role of Dobby in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010), appeared in the St. Trinian's sequel, as well as the Charles Darwin biopic Creation (2009) and Dustin Lance Black's post-Milk (2008) directorial outing, Virginia (2010). More Hollywood roles followed with appearances in The Rite (2011), Your Highness (2011), and his first big live-action breakthrough as Red Skull's biochemist Dr. Arnim Zola in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). Even before Toby was announced as Cladius Templesmith in the adaptation of the novel The Hunger Games (2012), his star was on the rise after Captain America, with roles in three Oscar-nominated films: La taupe (2011), My Week with Marilyn (2011), and The Adventures of Tintin (2011). Though chances are he will forever be known by many as Cladius, the announcer for The Hunger Games with the booming voice and penchant for ending his statements with the phrase, \"And may the odds be ever in your favor!\" Toby followed up this massive success with roles in Red Lights (2012) for Buried director Rodrigo Cortés and a memorable turn as one of the dwarves in worldwide hit Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). He will next be seen in The Girl (2012), a BBC/HBO co-production in which he stars as Alfred Hitchcock, in the miniseries Titanic (2012), Peter Strickland's Berberian Sound Studio (2012), Susanne Bier's Serena (2014), and he will reprise his role as Cladius Templesmith in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). Toby lives in London with his family.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMzc5NzM1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzA0ODk0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0429363","name":"Toby Jones","idIMDB":"nm0429363"},"actorId":"nm0429363","character":"Dr. Arnim Zola","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0066640","main":true},{"actorName":"Neal McDonough","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0568180","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzODQyODIyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE2OTEyNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 February 1966","placeOfBirth":" Dorchester, Massachusetts, USA","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Neal McDonough was born on February 13, 1966 in Dorchester, Massachusetts, to Catherine (Bushe) and Frank McDonough, motel owners who were born in Ireland.

Against his family's wishes, Choi left college to pursue that dream. He literally ran away from home, cutting all ties with his family for 5 years to train and study before moving to Los Angeles. His dream became a reality as he landed guest appearances in 6 television series during his first year including \"The West Wing\" and \"Roswell\". Choi gained recognition as both a comedic and dramatic actor with memorable guest turns on hit sitcoms \"The King of Queens\", \"Reba\", \"According to Jim\" and recurring roles in critically successful dramas such as \"House\" and \"24\". In 2008, Choi landed a starring role in the ABC Family series \"Samurai Girl\" opposite Jamie Chung, as well as recurring arcs in 2009 with Starz's \"Crash\" and Fox's \"Glee\", and in 2010 with TNT's \"Hawthorne\" and FX's critically-acclaimed \"Sons Of Anarchy\" playing Henry Lin. In 2004, Choi was cast in Steven Spielberg's \"The Terminal\". This sparked a surge in Choi's film career as he completed more than a dozen films through 2012 working with acclaimed writer/director David Ayer in \"Street Kings\" and \"Harsh Times\", and high profile roles in Lionsgate's \"War\" opposite Jason Statham, \"Red Dawn\" opposite Chris Hemsworth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and his supporting lead role in the Marvel blockbuster, \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" playing Howling Commando Jim Morita. Choi gained 25 pounds to play the tough but hilarious Chester Ming alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill in Martin Scorsese's Oscar-nominated, \"The Wolf Of Wall Street\". Along with his many film achievements, Choi has starred in several television shows including \"Ironside\" and \"Allegiance\" both for NBC Universal. Most notably, Choi inhabited the role of Judge Lance Ito for FX's highly-acclaimed Emmy-winning, Golden Globe-winning \"The People v. OJ Simpson: American Crime Story\" for Ryan Murphy. Choi has several feature films coming out in 2017 including, \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" with Tom Holland, \"Bright\" with Will Smith, and \"American Express\" with Joel Edgerton. Also in 2017, he recurs on the television shows, \"The Last Man On Earth\" for FOX, \"Counterpart\" for Starz, and a leading role on NBC's \"Untitled Kourtney Kang Project\".
