Wells started modeling and acting when she was a child. A classically trained actress, Julian studied drama at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and had a starring role in the long-running hit Off-Broadway play \"Tony n' Tina's Wedding.\" She has not only done TV commercials for Sprint, Sony, MTV, and Motorola, but also has been featured in such magazines as Playboy, Glamour, Vogue, Maxim, Marie Claire, and Mademoiselle. Moreover, Wells worked as a body double for Kim Cattrall for the smash cable TV series \"Sex in the City\" for two seasons (she also was a body double for Kate Moss and Ashley Judd) and has even appeared on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Julian first acted for the low-budget soft-core studio Seduction Cinema in a small part in the film \"Witchbabe: The Erotic Witch Project 3\" (she was a last minute fill-in for another actress who failed to show up the day the scene was shot). Wells went on to demonstrate her exceptional range and talent in a slew of soft-core pictures and horror features by alternating between lighthearted comedic parts and darker dramatic roles (she specialized in playing mature and worldly characters with dominating natures and voracious sexual appetites in this latter category). Julian popped up with pleasing regularity in said movies and even appeared in small roles on episodes of the hit cable TV shows \"The Sopranos\" and \"Entourage\" before retiring from the acting profession in 2008. Wells has since gone on to establish herself as a successful journalist under the name Suzy McCoppin: She has covered nightlife for such celebrity magazines as \"Life & Style\" and \"In Touch,\" served as the Los Angeles correspondent for the British publications \"The Daily Mail\" and \"The Sun,\" and has worked as both a nightlife and sex columnist for \"Playboy.\" In addition, Julian has been a spokesperson for the dating website Voiceplate.com and a regular contributor to Playboy radio on Sirius. A human rights advocate, Wells has done volunteer work for Amnesty International and is a member of Food on Foot, a Los Angeles-based charity dedicated to helping the homeless. She lives in West Hollywood, California.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1198632","name":"Julian Wells","idIMDB":"nm1198632"},"actorId":"nm1198632","character":"Eunice Willnotbe / Allanah / Burn Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Erin Brown","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0612691","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzkwNTAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTc2NTgy._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 October 1979","placeOfBirth":" East St. Louis, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Erin DeWright","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Erin Brown (born October 16, 1979 in Illinois, USA) is an actress, model, and film director.
