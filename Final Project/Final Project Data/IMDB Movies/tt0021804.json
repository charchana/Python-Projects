For one-third of the profits, I exhibited him in a tent.\" When he was age 9, his widowed mother moved to San Francisco where, following the earthquake of 1906, his family lived in a tent for two weeks \"in mortal terror of the fire.\" By 1910 he was in vaudeville and from there went on to Broadway plays and movies. A matinée idol in the silents, he came to prominence as the Cisco Kid with In Old Arizona (1928), for which he won an Oscar. He went on to star with Myrna Loy in Penthouse (1933) and to what many consider his best role, that of the doctor who treated Abraham Lincoln's assassin, in The Prisoner of Shark Island (1936). That year his $284,000 income topped the industry. In 1943, after slipping into a string of B-pictures, he began his Dr. Ordway \"Crime Doctor\" series with Crime Doctor (1943). He had suffered a nervous breakdown, and these pictures were easy on him (studio sets for one month, two films a year). Following a lobotomy to relieve pains of arthritis, he died of pneumonia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NTA0NDk0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTUyNjU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0062828","name":"Warner Baxter","idIMDB":"nm0062828"},"actorId":"nm0062828","character":"Dr. Judson Penning","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joan Bennett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000910","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0OTE5MzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTA3MjU2._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 February 1910","placeOfBirth":" Palisades, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Joan Geraldine Bennett","height":"5' 3½\" (1.61 m)","bio":"Joan Geraldine Bennett was born on February 27, 1910, in Palisades, New Jersey. Her parents were both successful stage actors, especially her father, Richard Bennett, and often toured the country for weeks at a time. In fact, Joan came from a long line of actors, dating back to the 18th century. Often, when her parents were on tour, Joan and her two older sisters, Constance Bennett, who later became an actress, and Barbara were left in the care of close friends. At the age of four, Joan made her first stage appearance. She debuted in films a year later in The Valley of Decision (1916), in which her father was the star and the entire Bennett clan participated. In 1923 she again appeared in a film which starred her father, playing a pageboy in The Eternal City (1923). It would be five more years before Joan appeared again on the screen. In between, she married Jack Marion Fox, who was 26 compared to her young age of 16. The union was anything but happy, in great part because of Fox's heavy drinking. In February of 1928 Joan and Jack had a baby girl they named Adrienne. The new arrival did little to help the marriage, though, and in the summer of 1928 they divorced. Now with a baby to support, Joan did something she had no intention of doing--she turned to acting. She appeared in Power (1928) with Alan Hale and Carole Lombard, a small role but a start. The next year she starred in Bulldog Drummond (1929), sharing top billing with Ronald Colman. Before the year was out she was in three more films--Disraeli (1929), The Mississippi Gambler (1929) and Three Live Ghosts (1929). Not only did audiences like her, but so did the critics. Between 1930 and 1931, Joan appeared in nine more movies. In 1932 she starred opposite Spencer Tracy in She Wanted a Millionaire (1932), but it wasn't one she liked to remember, partly because Tracy couldn't stand the fact that everyone was paying more attention to her than to him. Joan was to remain busy and popular throughout the rest of the 1930s and into the 1940s. By the 1950s Joan was well into her 40s and began to lessen her film appearances. She made only eight pictures, in addition to appearing in two television series. After Desire in the Dust (1960), Joan would be absent from the movie scene for the next ten years, resurfacing in House of Dark Shadows (1970), reprising her role from the Dark Shadows (1966) TV series as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Joan's final screen appearance was in the Italian thriller Suspiria (1977). Her final public performance was in the TV movie Divorce Wars: A Love Story (1982). On December 7, 1990, Joan died of a heart attack in Scarsdale, New York. She was 80 years old.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0OTE5MzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTA3MjU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000910","name":"Joan Bennett","nicknames":["Joanie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000910"},"actorId":"nm0000910","character":"Nina Wyndram Penning","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Victor Varconi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889511","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY5N2Q0YmUtMmY0My00Mjc2LTk1NjQtYzZjZTI5NDgyY2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 March 1891","placeOfBirth":" Kisvárda, Austria-Hungary [now Kisvárda, Szambolcs-Szatmár, Hungary]","birthName":"Mihály Várkonyi","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Handsome Hollywood character player Victor Varconi was born into a farming family on the Hungarian/Rumanian border. Christened Mihály Várkonyi, his career, following training at Budapest's commercial college and dramatic school, thrived for a time on the Transylvanian stage, where he played leads in such productions as \"Liliom\" at the Hungarian National Theatre in Budapest. His rising popularity as a matinée idol led to film roles, and he made his debut in Son of the Pusta (1914) [\"The Yellow Colt\"]. He had changed his marquee name to the more internationally friendly Michael Varkonyi by the time he branched out into German/Austrian co-productions such as Arme Violetta (1921) [\"Camille\"] opposite Pola Negri. In 1924, during Europe's constant political upheaval, Varconi arrived on American soil and sought fame and fortune as a Hollywood actor. Based on his exceptional work as the \"Angel of the Lord\" in the German/Austrian film Le sixième commandement (1922), Cecil B. DeMille gave him his American film debut opposite established star Leatrice Joy in Triumph (1924), billed now as Victor Varconi. He proceeded to work for DeMille on a number of silent films, including Changing Husbands (1924), Feet of Clay (1924), The Volga Boatman (1926) and The King of Kings (1927) as Pontius Pilate. Elegant and impeccably mannered in style and nature, Varconi went on to share the screen with some of silent film's loveliest and most talented ladies, including Agnes Ayres, Marie Prevost, Jetta Goudal and Phyllis Haver. Of note is his portrayal of cuckolded husband Amos opposite Haver's flashy jailbird Roxie Hart in the silent Chicago (1927). His last major silent role was that of Lord Horatio Nelson in The Divine Lady (1929) co-starring Oscar-nominated Corinne Griffith as Emma (Lady) Hamilton. The Hungarian Varconi had a decent voice for sound but his noticeably thick accent completely altered the course of his career. Instead of romantic leading man status, he regressed slightly to suave ethnic character roles -- often playing foreign or royal dignitaries, continental cads or cultivated villains. The forced move probably added years to his Hollywood life. World War II utilized his talents playing nefarious Axis commanders in spy intrigue and war dramas. In The Hitler Gang (1944) he was quite skillful portraying real-life Nazi bigwig and Adolf Hitler confidant Rudolf Hess. Varconi also appeared in many of DeMille's sound epics, such as The Plainsman (1936) (as an Indian chief), Reap the Wild Wind (1942), Unconquered (1947) and Samson and Delilah (1949). As his film career faded, Varconi turned more and more to stage work and radio writing. Among his Shakespearean theatre endeavors were roles in \"Hamlet,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and \"Richard III.\" He also moved occasionally into TV in the 1950s, then retired. Varconi published his memoirs, \"It's Not Enough to Be Hungarian\", shortly before suffering a fatal heart attack at age 85 in 1976.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY5N2Q0YmUtMmY0My00Mjc2LTk1NjQtYzZjZTI5NDgyY2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0889511","name":"Victor Varconi","idIMDB":"nm0889511"},"actorId":"nm0889511","character":"Dr. Kane Ruyter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cecilia Loftus","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0517480","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 October 1876","placeOfBirth":" Glasgow, Scotland, UK","birthName":"Marie Cecilia Loftus Brown","bio":"Cecilia Loftus was born on October 22, 1876 in Glasgow, Scotland as Marie Cecilia Loftus Brown.

She had a reputation as a fast learner, capable of reading and comprehending a script in a matter of hours. This ability served her well as an understudy early in her career. She made her Broadway debut in 1913 in 'Madam President' and later appeared in several productions of her stage director husband Myron C. Fagan (for instance,'Nancy's Private Affair',1930). Although Minna's specialty was street-wise, tough-talking blondes, she displayed quite a repertoire of varied characters during her movie career. She was best friend and steadying influence on Sally Eilers in Bad Girl (1931), a conflicted and unhappy mother in After Tomorrow (1932), the cold wife of The Thin Man (1934), a waspish wife in Babbitt (1934), brassy burlesque performers in Stepping Sisters (1932) and Comet Over Broadway (1938) and a tough nurse presiding over The Snake Pit (1948). She also had occasional leads, for instance as the gold-digger Stella in Bachelor's Affairs (1932), a comedy with Adolphe Menjou. An underrated and sadly, almost forgotten actress today, she enlivened many a film with her presence.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ5NGY3Y2YtMTZlMy00ZGFmLTk5YWMtODg0NDZkODExMzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326809","name":"Minna Gombell","idIMDB":"nm0326809"},"actorId":"nm0326809","character":"Julia Wyndram","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Helene Millard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587725","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 September 1905","placeOfBirth":" Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Her parents were Royal C.

During the early 1920's, he returned to the vaudeville circuit and began in films from 1928. Most of his early efforts were short one- and two-reel comedies, arguably his best being The Fatal Glass of Beer (1933) with W.C. Fields. While he mostly appeared in comedy and had countless bit parts, he later proved that he could handle meatier assignments, such as the simple-minded husband of Ginger Rogers, Amos, in Roxie Hart (1942). George was a protege of director William A. Wellman , who used him in twenty of his films. On television, he made his mark as the jovial, well-remembered Uncle Petrie in Lassie (1954). He also had many good guest spots in other series, a particularly enjoyable one being the old man who sells a haunted Model A to dubious second-hand car dealer Jack Carson(with interesting results) in The Twilight Zone (1959) episode 'The Whole Truth' (1961). Prior to replacing Ronald Reagan as president of the Screen Actor's Guild, Chandler had been treasurer for twelve years (1948-60).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E0N2Q0YWUtZjg5YS00MjY2LTg4ZGEtY2RmNDBhODVmYzZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151370","name":"George Chandler","idIMDB":"nm0151370"},"actorId":"nm0151370","character":"Dr. Roberts","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Violet Dunn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0242792","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 May 1905","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","bio":"Violet Dunn was born on May 28, 1905 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
