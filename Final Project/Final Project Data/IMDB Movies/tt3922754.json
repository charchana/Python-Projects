She has 10 brothers and sisters, and she is #9 in the pecking order. So she learned from a very young age how to play well with others, fight for her rights and share MUCH more than she ever cared to. Her step-father was a Lt. Colonel in the Army and he met her mother while doing a tour in Germany. He adopted the last 5 children remaining in the home and moved them all to America. It takes a very loving and kind man to accept an entire family into his heart as he did and she admires and loves him beyond belief. May he rest in peace. Analiese's first memories of America are The Statue of Liberty as the ship pulled into New York Harbor and The Golden Gate Bridge as her family settled in San Francisco. She grew up being painfully shy and quite introverted. After briefly moving back to Germany her family moved to Lincoln, NE where she played tennis for the University of Nebraska and then moved to Tuscaloosa to finish her degree at Alabama. This is where she caught the acting bug. She auditioned for the school play \"Death of A Salesman\" to get over her fear of being in front of an audience. This unleashed \"The Diva\" in her! She performed in musicals such as \"South Pacific\" and \"Carnival\", was involved in comedies, dramas, commercials, modeling and print work. She slowed down to get married, however, unfortunately it wasn't meant to be and they divorced 5 years later, She then raised her son as a single mom and strived to be the best mother she could be. And to this day he is still her greatest accomplishment. After he entered college she realized she missed being in the spotlight. Analiese describes being in front of an audience or in front of the camera as an intense high that last for hours after the cameras quit rolling or the curtain drops. She has never found anything else that makes her feel that way and she has to chase that dream. In the past few years she has been privileged to have speaking roles in films, be part of national commercials, shoot a pilot as a co-host and do voice-over work for an audiobook. She has also had the pleasure of appearing in two television series, Drop Dead Diva and The Gates. Currently(2011) she has shot the pilot for a new talk show and 3 additional episodes. Analieses' defining moment came five years ago. Her son was graduating from high school and her father (her safety net), her cat and dog all passed away from cancer in a matter of a few months. And if that wasn't enough, she had to overcome a life threatening disease the following month. Those devastating months gave Analiese the rude awakening she needed. She realized this is her niche in life.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMDY0ODkxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgwODYwNzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3165078","name":"Analiese Anderson","idIMDB":"nm3165078"},"actorId":"nm3165078","character":"Mother Mary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Trey Hough","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4218953","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"Travis A Hough","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born Travis Alan Hough (August 8th 1989) nicknamed Trey.
