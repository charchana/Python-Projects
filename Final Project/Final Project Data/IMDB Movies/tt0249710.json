To our right, a lad places the card announcing the next act, \"Levi and Cohen Irish Comedians.\" The curtain rises revealing a store front; the comedians enter from our right. One wears a bowler, one a top hat. The fellow in the top hat regales the other with a stream of words and an occasional bat with a rolled up newspaper, which knocks the bowler off. After three of these nearly-identical thrashings about, the audience lets the comics know what they think of the routine.","simplePlot":"Showing two typical concert hall knock-about teams in a very poor performance. It ends up in their being egged by the audience. Very realistic and very funny.","actors":[],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0249710","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249710","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"30","month":"06","year":"1903","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"30","month":"06","year":"1903","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":"American Mutoscope &amp; Biograph Co."},"technical":{"runtime":["1 min"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.2","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Biograph Studio, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA"}],"awards":[],"votes":"59","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0066927","name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["character name in title"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 17:50:16"}}
