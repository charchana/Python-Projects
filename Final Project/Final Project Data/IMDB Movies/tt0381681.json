Although he is vague to reporters about the source material for the book, it is about his chance encounter nine years earlier on June 15-16, 1994 with a Parisienne named Celine, and the memorable and romantic day and evening they spent together in Vienna. At the end of their encounter at the Vienna train station, which is also how the book ends, they, not providing contact information to the other, vowed to meet each other again in exactly six months at that very spot. As the media scrum at the bookstore nears its conclusion, Jesse spots Celine in the crowd, she who only found out about the book when she earlier saw his photograph promoting this public appearance.

His parents were students at the University of Texas at the time but divorced when Ethan was 5 years old. His mother raised him alone for the next five years, moving around the country, until she remarried in 1981 and the family settled in Princeton Junction, New Jersey. He attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and then transferred to the Hun School of Princeton and it was while he was there that he began taking acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus. His early ambition had been to be a writer, but as a result of the acting lessons and appearances in student productions he persuaded his mother to allow him to attend an audition for a role in a sci-fi adolescent adventure, Explorers (1985). He got the part (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for a few years. He was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society (1989) and he didn't complete his degree. His subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony nomination for his role in The Coast of Utopia at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of \"serious\" and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Training Day (2001). Meanwhile, he also pursued his childhood ambition and has written two novels and several screenplays.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NDMxMTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE3ODE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000160","name":"Ethan Hawke","idIMDB":"nm0000160"},"actorId":"nm0000160","character":"Jesse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0006069","main":true},{"actorName":"Julie Delpy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000365","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4ODM0MjI5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQ5NjM1._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 December 1969","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Julie Delpy was born in Paris, France, in 1969 to Albert Delpy and Marie Pillet, both actors.
