He is also a prolific songwriter, responsible for writing or co-writing many international hits with Queen. He was educated at Hampton Grammar School in London. He then graduated with a degree in Maths and Physics from one of Britain's top universities, Imperial College London. As a child, May built his own guitar with his father, partly out of an old fireplace. Unusually, the guitar was designed to feedback. He formed the band Smile while at university with drummer Roger Taylor. They were later joined by flamboyant singer and pianist Freddie Mercury, who renamed the band Queen. The addition of bass player John Deacon completed the line-up of a band which would go on to become one of the most successful in the history of popular music. May's guitar playing would become an integral part of Queen's sound. May was influenced as a guitarist by the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, who had dazzled audiences with their technical skills and volume, but he was also an admirer of the melodic skills of George Harrison of The Beatles and the original British rock and roll guitar hero, Hank B. Marvin of The Shadows. What made May stand out as a guitarist was his combination of virtuoso technique but also melodic awareness. Unlike some virtuosos, who only play to showcase their ability, May always played to serve the songs. If a song only required minimal soloing, that's all he would do. His multi-tracking of guitar solos has also made him one of the most unique sounding guitarists in the world. Nowhere was this better exemplified than on Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", the song which came to define the band more than any other and has become one of the most celebrated recordings in the history of rock music. May's solos are a big part of what gives the track its enduring appeal and emotional power. May's legacy in music history is assured. He will be remembered along with the likes of George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page as one of the most important and influential guitarists to come out of England. His songs for Queen were often their harder rock tracks, such as \"We Will Rock You\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\" and \"Hammer to Fall\", but he also wrote emotional songs such as \"Save Me\" and the symphonic \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", which proved his versatility as a songwriter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MDM0MTQ0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU1NjU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006190","name":"Brian May","nicknames":["Bri"],"idIMDB":"nm0006190"},"actorId":"nm0006190","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Roger Taylor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003547","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMDkzMzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTYwNTQz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 July 1949","placeOfBirth":" Kings Lynn, Norfolk, England, UK","birthName":"Roger Meddows Taylor","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician who performs as a multi-instrumentalist, singer and songwriter. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Queen, but has also served as songwriter and occasional lead vocalist. As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen's albums from the very beginning, composing at least one track on every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three UK number 1s (\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\", \"Innuendo\" and \"Under Pressure\") and contributed a further major hits (\"Radio Ga Ga\", \"A Kind of Magic\",\"One Vision\", \"Heaven for Everyone\", \"Breakthru\", and \"The Invisible Man\"). In addition to his drum work, Taylor routinely played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as The Cross, in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. Taylor is also well-known for his falsetto vocal range. By the time Queen's album 'News of the World' was released in 1977, Taylor had met his future girlfriend, Dominique Beyrand, who was working for Richard Branson at the time, who was at the helm of Queen's free concert at Hyde Park. They lived together from 1980 to 1987, raising their two children: actor Felix Taylor and doctor Rory Eleanor Taylor. They decided to get married for reasons relating to his estate, to protect his children's interests in the future. At the time, Taylor was seeing another girl, model/actress Deborah Leng, the Cadbury's Flake girl also seen in Queen's \"Breakthru\" video; he moved in with her a month after his marriage of convenience to Beyrand. Before Freddie Mercury's death, Taylor and Leng had their first child, drummer Rufus Taylor, who was born in March 1991. He ended up having two more children with Leng: models Tigerlily Taylor (1994) and Lola Daisy Taylor (2000). In late 2002, they decided to break up. Taylor remarried on 26 August 2010, to Sarina Taylor. He resides in Guildford, Surrey, but also has a home in Helford, Cornwall.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMDkzMzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTYwNTQz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003547","name":"Roger Taylor","idIMDB":"nm0003547"},"actorId":"nm0003547","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Smith","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5215126","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5215126","name":"Chris Smith","idIMDB":"nm5215126"},"actorId":"nm5215126","character":"Himself - Keyboards, Smile","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Freddie Mercury","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006198","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgyMjk2MzE1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA3MTUxNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 September 1946","placeOfBirth":" Stone Town, Zanzibar, Tanzania","birthName":"Farrokh Bomi Bulsara","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Freddie Mercury was born on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar. His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, sent him off to a private school in India, from 1955 til 1963. In 1964 Freddie and his family flew to England. Freddie was very delighted to come to England. In 1966 he started his education at the Ealing College of Art, where he graduated in 1969. He loved art, and because of that, he often went along with his friend Tim Staffell, who played in a band called Smile. Also in this band where Brian May and Roger Taylor. When Staffell left the band in 1970, Freddie became their new singer. He changed the band's name into Queen, and they took on a new bass-player in February 1971, called John Deacon. Their first album, \"Queen\", came out in 1973. But their real breakthrough was \"Killer Queen\", on the album \"Sheer Heart Attack\", which was released in 1974. They became immortal with the single \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", on the 1975 album \"A Night At The Opera\". After setting foot in the US in 1980, with \"Another One Bites The Dust\", they had a bad period. Their album \"Flash Gordon\" went down the drain, because the movie Flash Gordon (1980) flunked. Their next, \"Hot Space\", also wasn't a great success. Only the song \"Under Pressure\", which they sang together with David Bowie, made a difference. In 1983, they took a year off. But, in 1984 they were totally back with their new album, called \"The Works\". It contained great hits, such as \"Radio Ga Ga\" and \"I Want To Break Free\". In 1985 Freddie made his first big solo-album, \"Mr. Bad Guy\". He and the band had been in a bit of an argument, and he wanted to do something on his own. The album was loved by the fans, but didn't do to well. But the band got back together again, after their famous performance at Live Aid, in 1985. At the end of the year, they started working on their new album, \"A Kind Of Magic\". They also held their most famous tour ever, the \"Magic Tour\". They did Wembley Stadium twice, and held their very last concert in Knebworth, in front of 125.000 people. After 1986, it went silent around Queen. It was in 1987 or '88, when Freddie told the band he had AIDS, and only had a few years to live. After Freddie told the band, he refused to talk about it anymore. He was afraid that people would buy their records out of pity. He said he wanted to keep making music as long as possible. And he did. His second big solo-album, \"The Great Pretender\", got out in 1987. After that, he flew to Spain, where he made the magnificent album \"Barcelone\", together with Montserrat Caballé, whom he saw performing in 1983. Because Freddie loved opera, he became a huge fan of her. For him, this album was like a dream becoming reality. The single \"Barcelona\" went huge, and was also used as a theme song for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. After Barcelona, he started working with the band again. They made \"The Miracle\", which was released in 1989. It was a success, with hits as \"Breakthru\", \"I Want It All\" and \"The Invisible Man\". After \"The Miracle\", Freddie's health got worse. They wanted to do one more album, called \"Innuendo.\" They worked on it in 1990 and early 1991. Every time when Freddie would feel well, he came over to the studio and sang. After \"Innuendo\" was released in January 1991, they made two video clips. The first one was the video clip of \"I'm Going Slightly Mad\", shot in March 1991. Because Freddie was very thin, and had little wounds all over his body, they used a lot of make-up. He wore a wig, and the clip was shot in black and white. Freddie's final video clip was released in June 1991. The clip, \"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\", later turned out to be his goodbye song, the last time he appeared on film. You could clearly see he was ill, but he still hadn't told the world about his disease. Rumours went around that he some kind of terrible disease. This rumor was confirmed by Freddie himself, one day before he passed on. His death was seen as a great loss for the world of music.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgyMjk2MzE1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA3MTUxNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006198","name":"Freddie Mercury","idIMDB":"nm0006198"},"actorId":"nm0006198","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rosie Horide","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2337313","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Rosie Horide yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2337313","name":"Rosie Horide","idIMDB":"nm2337313"},"actorId":"nm2337313","character":"Herself - Disc Magazine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tony Stewart","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8001613","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Tony Stewart yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8001613","name":"Tony Stewart","idIMDB":"nm8001613"},"actorId":"nm8001613","character":"Himself - New Musical Express","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Deacon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0212577","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 August 1951","placeOfBirth":" Leicester, Leicestershire, England, UK","birthName":"John Richard Deacon","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"John Deacon was born on August 19, 1951 in Leicester, Leicestershire, England as John Richard Deacon.
