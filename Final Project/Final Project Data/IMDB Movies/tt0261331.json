She excelled at tragedy and was often shown in a white sari carrying the film with her emotive acting. She was also thought to be the only actress who could sell a film on the strength of her name alone. Her major films are Daera (1953), Baiju Bawra (1952), 0046164, and of course her most well known film, Pakeezah (1972). She was married to Kamal Amrohi with whom she started making \"Pakeezah\". They separated in 1964. She was also an accompalished Urdu writer and had several poems published by Gulzar after her death. She battled alcoholism and loneliness and finally died, alone, in 1972.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NjQ1Nzg2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkyNjAzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0474932","name":"Meena Kumari","nicknames":["Manju"],"idIMDB":"nm0474932"},"actorId":"nm0474932","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anjaneyulu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0030122","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Anjaneyulu is an actor, known for Sudigundaalu (1967).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0030122","name":"Anjaneyulu","idIMDB":"nm0030122"},"actorId":"nm0030122","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Prasanna Rani","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0710156","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Prasanna Rani is an actress, known for Sudigundaalu (1967) and Shri Krishna Vijayam (1970).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0710156","name":"Prasanna Rani","idIMDB":"nm0710156"},"actorId":"nm0710156","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0261331","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0261331","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":null,"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"8.6","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"20","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0064445","name":"Annapoorna Pictures"},{"idCompany":"co0048725","name":"Babu Movies"},{"idCompany":"co0037790","name":"Chakravarthi Chitra Combines"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 06:06:27"}}
