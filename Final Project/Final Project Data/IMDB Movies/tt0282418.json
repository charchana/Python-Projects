A year later, he earned a co-starring role in the play \"The Shadow Box\" and a minor role in the movie The Double McGuffin came two years after that. At age 18, Spano was cast in The Black Stallion Returns after a long and intense audition process (which involved proving that the NYC boy could ride a horse). With this film, he was welcomed into Francis Coppola's Zoetrope family who produced the film. Directly following the profound and exciting experience in which he spent six months out of the country shooting in Italy, Morocco and Algeria, Spano returned home for what many consider to be his \"big break\" - the role of \"The Sheik\" in John Sayles' Italian-Catholic-boy-meets-Jewish-girl romance, Baby It's You. After the films' success, he was thrilled to have the opportunity once again to work with one of his favorite directors, Francis Coppola, in the role of Steve in Rumblefish. In less than a year, Spano had put three major films in the can and had certainly established his career as a \"serious\" film actor. To date, Spano has acted in more than 40 theatrical and television films and has made memorable guest appearances in some of the best shows on television. Spano has won several awards for his work over the years and was nominated as Best Actor for Cable's ACE Award for his role as \"baby mafia\" economic powerhouse Marc Ciuni in Showtime's Blood Ties. Spano was one of the youngest honorees at the Lake Arrowhead film festival, joining the ranks other noted honorees including; Joe Mantegna, Kirk Douglas, and Gena Rowlands. He continues to be recognized in Italy receiving multiple awards alongside great actors like Giancarlo Giannini & Joe Pesci.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNTI4NjIwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ4MzQyNDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001759","name":"Vincent Spano","nicknames":["Vinnie"],"idIMDB":"nm0001759"},"actorId":"nm0001759","character":"Jack Carver","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shawn Michael Howard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397599","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMjk5MTA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5MjEwNQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 July 1969","placeOfBirth":" Newark, New Jersey, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born and raised in Newark, New Jersey on July 31, 1969, Howard is the youngest of three boys.
