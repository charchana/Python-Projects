She has posed for Playboy magazine and appeared in one of their videos, Playboy: Girls of the Internet. Gabriella was born in Los Angeles but grew up on the beaches of Northern California. She auditioned for fashion print work on a whim as a way to pay for veterinarian school. Her fashion print work led to runway modeling in Europe before she returned to California. Gabriella had always been fascinated with movies from when she was a little girl with Rita Hayworth being her favorite actress at the time. Her first major role was in a movie called Centerfold (later renamed Naked Ambition). After that, she would go on to appear in 18 features over the next two years. It was her appearance in the Nicolas Roeg drama, Full Body Massage, (as the younger flashback of Mimi Rogers' character, Nina) that drew the attention of film producers such as Curtis Hansen, and kept her steadily employed in a variety of movies. In her spare time Gabriella enjoys playing with animals, reading, and cooking with friends.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355588","name":"Gabriella Hall","idIMDB":"nm0355588"},"actorId":"nm0355588","character":"Linda","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Chielens","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0157306","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"David Chielens is an actor, known for The Body Beautiful (1997) and Click (1997).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0157306","name":"David Chielens","idIMDB":"nm0157306"},"actorId":"nm0157306","character":"Ben","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Donavan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0232319","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MTQyMzI2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM5MTM5NQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Robert Donavan is an actor, known for Aliens Gone Wild (2007), Murdercycle (1999) and You Only Live Until You Die (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MTQyMzI2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM5MTM5NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0232319","name":"Robert Donavan","idIMDB":"nm0232319"},"actorId":"nm0232319","character":"William Haywood","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacqueline Lovell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0522550","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExMTU5MDU2NTFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQzMTQyMjg@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 December 1974","placeOfBirth":" Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Jacqueline Marie Pugh","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Jacqueline Lovell was born and raised in Southern California. From a very young age, she had the immense innate talent and enthusiasm for performance. She expressed this through school musicals and church plays from grade school through high school. In much of her free time, she was writing skits and performing them for her family. She attended many schools during her formative years, which instilled drive and independence in her. At eighteen, she went to Santa Monica College to pursue accounting and later landed a full time job as an accountant. However, she quickly realized her hunger was not being fulfilled. So she set sail and journeyed into the world of modeling. She quickly became the number one nude model in 1995 and was in over 150 magazines by '96. She completed more than 80 videos for Playboy, Penthouse and numerous independents. Not only beautiful but also intelligent, she became the publisher for \"Babe\" Magazine. She also wrote for \"Femme Fatales\" Magazine and for major internet corporations such as Danni Ash's Harddrive. After being in the industry for one year, Jacqueline's desire to grow as a person led her to acting classes. As she studied her craft, her vocation became clear. She started as an extra in Forest Gump, The Truth about Cats and Dogs, Murder She Wrote, Baywatch Nights and before long her talent was recognized. She was cast in lead roles for Full Moon Entertainment, Zalman King Productions, Mystique Films, and many more. Jacqueline has acted in films around the world planting her seed in film history. She has easily become one of the top erotic actresses in Hollywood. Others with as much success in erotic films might be content to focus only on that genre. But not someone with Jacqueline's talent. She has closed this chapter in her life to focus on mainstream roles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExMTU5MDU2NTFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQzMTQyMjg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0522550","name":"Jacqueline Lovell","idIMDB":"nm0522550"},"actorId":"nm0522550","character":"Susan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rick Jordan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430155","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Rick Jordan is an actor, known for Stripteaser II (1997), Passion and Romance: Double or Nothing (1997) and Click (1997).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430155","name":"Rick Jordan","idIMDB":"nm0430155"},"actorId":"nm0430155","character":"Ted Fields","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nina Leichtling","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500092","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nina Leichtling is an actress, known for Anywhere But Here (1999), The Body Beautiful (1997) and Expose (1997).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500092","name":"Nina Leichtling","idIMDB":"nm0500092"},"actorId":"nm0500092","character":"Margo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kiva","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1843897","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kiva is an actress, known for The Body Beautiful (1997) and Click (1997).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1843897","name":"Kiva","idIMDB":"nm1843897"},"actorId":"nm1843897","character":"Pamela","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Melodi Clark","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0164286","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Melodi Clark is an actress, known for The Body Beautiful (1997), Justine: Exotic Liaisons (1995) and Justine: A Midsummer Night's Dream (1997).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0164286","name":"Melodi Clark","idIMDB":"nm0164286"},"actorId":"nm0164286","character":"Rose","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Taylor St. Clair","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003286","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 June 1969","placeOfBirth":" Richmond, Virginia, USA","birthName":"Kimberly Knight","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Taylor St. Clair broke into the porn business in pro/am videos in 1995 after a career as a model, actress in softcore and \"B\" movies and stripper.
