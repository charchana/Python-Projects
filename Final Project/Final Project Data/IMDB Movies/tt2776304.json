She is a singer and well-known voice actress. She was raised by her grandmother through her difficult childhood because her mother was a drug addict. Her grandmother was a singer and performed often with Tito Puente. Grey was highly interested in goth bands, mostly The Cure. Her mother, however, born-again Pentecostal, strictly forbade Grey to listen to goth music. In her late teens, she sang gospel songs. Thanks to that, she became interested in stand-up comedy and started to perform it. She also had a talent for voice impressions, which led to voice acting. DeLisle started in a few animation series and, since then, has been featured in numerous video games. She is best-known for her sinister voice of the evil sister \"Vicky\" in the Nickelodeon TV series, \"Fairly OddParents\" (2001-2013), as well as the equally evil \"Mandy\" in the Cartoon Network TV show, \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\" (2001 - 2007). She voiced evil, cold \"Mandy\" again in two more films about Billy and Mandy, \"Billy and Mandy Big Boogie Adventure\" (2007) and \"The Grim Adventures of KND\" (2007), opposite'Richard Steven Horvitz' (Billy) and Greg Eagles (Grim).

She retired when the dance teacher was arrested on a morals charge for \"dating\" the tall and lissome, yet underage, star dancer in the troupe. That girl's big number culminated with a back-bend where Edie drank a soda upside down (of course). Edie has a Master of Science from Syracuse and taught radio at the University of Missouri/Kansas City for eight years. There she re-entered the entertainment field as a DJ, newswoman and producer for the NPR affiliate KCUR-FM. Her proudest moment was portraying John Ehrlichman in Conversation 26 of the NPR national broadcast of the Nixon Tape Transcripts. Thus did Edie contribute to the peaceful overthrow of the government of an unindicted co-conspirator. Her career-long devotion to satirical improvisation included an impressive tenure with The Groundlings. She went on to create original characters, performed on the daytime The David Letterman Show (1980): Mrs. Marv Mendenhall, Dot Duncan, Whirly June Pickens, Officer Jeanelle Archer, 105-year-old Edie, etc. TV has been a home to many of Edie's characters--on The Richard Pryor Show (1977); as Lucille Tarlek, wife of mega-obnoxious ad salesman Herb Tarlek on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978); and as Mrs. Poole on Valerie (1986). Her movie career growth paralleled her ten years with The Groundlings. Her first film was the teen horror favorite Carrie (1976). She did several John Hughes films, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), She's Having a Baby (1988) and _Curly Sue (1990)_. Offbeat cult faves are Eating Raoul (1982), Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988), HBO's The Pee Wee Herman Show (1981) and Martin Mull's The History of White People in America (1985). In more mainstream films, she received a National Media Award for her portrayal of a mentally disabled woman in Bill: On His Own (1983), starring Mickey Rooney. She's acted for Robert Redford in A River Runs Through It (1992), for Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers (1994), for Diane Keaton in Raccroche! (2000) and she was named Best Actress of the Chicago Alternative Film Festival for her portrayal of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski's mother. A few of Edie's most recent accomplishments: Fat Actress (2005)' Rude Lady in Restroom, David Spade's nasty neighbor in Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star (2003), Dana Carvey's mother in Sony Pictures' The Master of Disguise (2002), Jane Kaczmarek's friend in Malcolm in the Middle (2000), guest-starring on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), NBC's Providence (1999), WB's 7th Heaven (1996), Lea Thompson's mother on Caroline in the City (1995) and several animation roles for TV and in features, such as The Little Mermaid (1989), The Rugrats Movie (1998) and as Dr. Flora in A Bug's Life (1998).
