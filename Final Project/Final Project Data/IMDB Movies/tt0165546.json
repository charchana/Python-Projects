He followed that up in the coming years with other roles in TV series, short, and feature films. By mid-1980s, Bjelogrlic was an established young actor in SFR Yugoslavia. In 1985 he appeared in Bal na vodi as part of an ensemble cast of his peers such as Srdjan Todorovic, Nebojsa Bakocevic, Goran Radakovic, and Gala Videnovic. In 1987, he became one of the central cast members on the hugely popular drama television series Bolji zivot. Playing the role of Boba Popadic made Bjelogrlic a bona fide recognizable star all across the country. He is considered somewhat of a \"Serbian Robert Redford\", by many. His monotone voice and tired face leads him to be cast as a gangster or criminal figure in movies such as \"Rane\" (The Wounds), where he plays a hot-headed Serbian mafioso, with a short temper that only Dragan Bjelogrlic could provide for the movie that's considered one of the cult Serbian gangster movies, especially it being with a focus on the Yugoslav Wars . His brother Goran Bjelogrlic is a film producer. His 2010 film Montevideo, God Bless You! was selected as the Serbian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. The sequel, See You in Montevideo, was released in 2014.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg2NzgyODc4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTYzMDk4NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0081449","name":"Dragan Bjelogrlic","nicknames":["Bjela"],"idIMDB":"nm0081449"},"actorId":"nm0081449","character":"Kure","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Branka Katic","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0441287","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0NzE4NTI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ3MTYwMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 January 1970","placeOfBirth":" Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Branka Katic was born on January 20, 1970 in Belgrade, Serbia, Yugoslavia.
