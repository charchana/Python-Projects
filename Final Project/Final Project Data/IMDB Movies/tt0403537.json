As a result, his \"street credibility\" was initially questioned at the onset of his career. Dash received his official start in the music industry when he produced 90's rap group, Original Flavor's first album. One of the members of Original Flavor, Tone Hooker, later became a member of the Roc-A-Fella staff.

Dash was also responsible for Cam'ron having been signed to Roc-A-Fella. It was Cam'ron's controversial signing to the label that signaled the beginning of the end of Damon's relationship with longtime friend and business associate Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter. Jay-Z has also publicly stated that he had no interest in being a part of the Hollywood movie scene, unlike Dash. Since the sale of Roc-A-Fella Records to Def Jam, Damon started the Damon Dash Music Group. Nicole Wray, formerly of Missy Elliot's Gold Mind label, was signed to DDMG. She recently left the label. Damon Dash sold his interest in Roc-A-Wear Clothing to Jay-Z and is no longer involved with the line.

Dash stays very active as an actor, movie director, music producer and CEO. He recently produced singles for the likes of Victoria \"Posh Spice\" Beckham.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDU3MDMxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODgxNTY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201965","name":"Damon Dash","nicknames":["Dame"],"idIMDB":"nm0201965"},"actorId":"nm0201965","character":"Dame","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Bentt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0072715","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYyMjc3MzYwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgwNDA2Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1965","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"Born in London, England, to Jamaican parents and raised in Queens, New York,Michael attended Northhampton College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania after retiring from boxing.

Though his playing earned him scholarship offers from top colleges, Cam'ron was unable to take advantage of them because of his poor academic record, and he enrolled at a small college in Texas instead. He quickly dropped out and returned to Harlem, where he became a drug dealer before turning to rap. Hooking up with the Bad Boy posse, he developed a pop-rap style similar to chief Bad Boy Puff Daddy. But Cam'ron didn't sign with Bad Boy; Mase introduced him to the Notorious B.I.G., who in turn brought in his partner Lance \"Un\" Rivera. Un signed Cam'ron to his Untertainment label, distributed by Epic Records. Cam'ron first attracted attention with \"Pull It,\" which earned airplay in May 1998. \"3-5-7\" was featured in the movie Woo and became his first R&B chart entry in June. Then in July came \"Horse & Carriage,\" featuring Mase. It made the R&B Top Ten and just missed hitting the pop Top 40, setting up Cam'ron's debut album, Confessions of Fire, which went gold and made the Top Ten of both the pop and R&B charts. \"Feels Good\" featuring Usher was another R&B chart entry in December. \"Let Me Know\" made the pop and R&B charts in June 1999. A year later, \"What Means the World to You\" heralded the release of Cam'ron's biographical sophomore album, S.D.E. (the initials standing for Sports, Drugs, and Entertainment). Cam'ron worked with Ol' Dirty Bastard, Mobb Deep's Prodigy, and producer Digga to complete the album, which was released in September 2000","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNjM2NTczNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDY5ODc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1004112","name":"Cam'ron","nicknames":["Killa Cam"],"idIMDB":"nm1004112"},"actorId":"nm1004112","character":"Cam'ron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Juelz Santana","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1724629","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQxOTQyNDk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTE3NzU1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 February 1983","placeOfBirth":" Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"LaRon Louis James","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Juelz Santana was born on February 18, 1983 in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA as LaRon Louis James.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQxOTQyNDk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTE3NzU1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1724629","name":"Juelz Santana","nicknames":["L'z","JuJu"],"idIMDB":"nm1724629"},"actorId":"nm1724629","character":"Juelz Sanchez","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jim Jones","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1530170","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNzk1MjA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NTQ2MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 July 1976","placeOfBirth":" Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Joseph Guillermo Jones","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Jim Jones was born on July 15, 1976 in Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA as Joseph Guillermo Jones.
