He then joined ground-breaking British experimental theatre company Impact Theatre Cooperative as an actor. For the next six years Steve appeared in thirteen original shows which toured throughout the UK and Europe. When Impact disbanded Steve went on to write, produce, direct and design a dozen new shows for his own theatre company which performed in Britain and around the world. Retrospectives of his work were staged at Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary Arts and the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. In recognition of his work in theatre, Steve was selected for the BBC Drama Director's Course and was trained at the Television Centre in Shepherds Bush, London to direct for the screen in multi camera, single camera, video and film. He went on to direct for UK ratings leaders \"EastEnders\", \"Emmerdale\", \"Casualty\" and \"The Bill\" before relocating to New York. His first job in the US was for Sidney Lumet on his TV courtroom series \"100 Centre Street\" starring Alan Arkin. Sidney wanted to make television drama the way he'd done it live in the 1950s and Steve was hired because of his BBC training and experience in that style. Following many episodes of the \"Law & Order\" franchise in New York for Dick Wolf, Steve began to work for HBO on \"The Wire\" in Baltimore and then \"The Sopranos\", \"Rome\", \"Carnivale\" and \"Big Love\". He directed the pilot of \"The Tudors\" in Dublin starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers and was nominated for a 2006 WGA Award for his writing on \"Deadwood\" which he also directed.

Born in 1924 in New Haven, Connecticutt, Blossom graduated from the prestigious Asheville School in 1941 and attended Harvard. Roberts initially planned on being a therapist, but eventually changed his mind and decided to become an actor instead. He made his film debut in the bizarre and little seen independent feature \"The Sin of Jesus\" (1961). It wasn't until he was in his late forties and early fifties that Blossom really hit his stride acting in motion pictures. Roberts gave a truly remarkable and unforgettable performance as demented middle-aged backwoods lunatic Ezra Cobb in the creepy horror cult favorite \"Deranged\" (1974). Other memorable film roles include an ill-fated elderly patient in \"The Hospital\" (1971), a sickly soldier in \"Slaughterhouse Five\" (1972), Paul Le Mat's ornery father in \"Citizen's Band\" (1977), a farmer who saw Bigfoot once in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (1977), a venerable old felon in \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), a kindly next door neighbor in \"Home Alone\" (1990), and a grumpy small town judge in \"Doc Hollywood\" (1991). Blossom did guest spots on such TV shows as \"Northern Exposure,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"The Equalizer,\" \"Moonlighting,\" \"Amazing Stories,\" and \"Naked City.\" Moreover, Blossom was also a poet (he released some of his dramatic poems on video) and a playwright who won four Obies and a Show Business Award.
