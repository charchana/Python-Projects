Senta and her father performed together when she was just four years old. She sang and her dad played the piano. At five years old, she took ballet lessons and at 14, Berger turned to acting taking private lessons. She left her private school education at 16. In 1957, Berger was discovered by famous director Willi Forst and played a small role in a film. She was accepted to the Max Reinhardt Seminar. In 1958, Berger was the youngest member at the Vienna Theater in Josefstadt. Director Bernhard Wicki and producer Artur Brauner sought after Senta producing the film The Good Soldier, by Heinz Rühmann. It succeeded and Brauner used her in several films. In 1962, Berger moved to Hollywood and starred with Charlton Heston, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Richard Harris, George Hamilton, Kirk Douglas, John Wayne and Yul Brynner. In 1969 she returned to Europe and was seen during the 1970's in Italian productions of various genres. In 1967, she returned to the silver screen with an Alain Delon film. In 1968, Berger played in the three-part thriller Babeck by Herbert Reinecker. 1970 was her debut as Producer of her own company. As director she put her husband's film before the camera. Further, international successful of films of her production company have included The White Rose, The Nasty Girl and Mother Courage. In addition, Berger expanded her European career in France and Italy. The birth of her two sons, Simon (b. 1972) and Luca (b. 1979) prompted Berger to turn back to the theater. In 1985/86, she managed her TV comeback in front of the German-speaking audience in the television series Kir Royal co-starring with Franz Xaver Kroetz , Dieter Hildebrandt and Billie Zöckler. Many TV series guest appearances followed.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NTE2NDM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1MzIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000919","name":"Senta Berger","idIMDB":"nm0000919"},"actorId":"nm0000919","character":"Maria Koppel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mario Adorf","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000728","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDliNTUxZDgtYzVlOS00NzQ2LTk4NjUtZTM5NWNkNDM4N2VjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 September 1930","placeOfBirth":" Zurich, Switzerland","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Mario Adorf, a tell-tale name indeed. Mario calls to mind the actor's Italian roots (his father was a Calabrian surgeon) whereas Adorf reveals his German origins (his mother was a radiologist from the German region Eifel). As for the full name Mario Adorf it echoes to perfection the international character of this living legend's long career. Born in 1930, Mario Adorf was still studying drama at the famous Otto Falkenberg School in Munich when he landed his first role in the first installment of the \"O8/15\" series in 1954. It was a small part but it didn't go unnoticed and got him new roles in German films, the most remarkable of which being that of Bruno Lüdke, the mentally retarded serial killer in Robert Siodmak's 1957 masterpiece \"Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam\". It earned him his first prize (the German Film Award of the outstanding young actor of 1958). After this Mario Adorf's career turned international. His Mediterranean looks, his rugged face, his dark oily frizzy hair and his volubility made him an ideal villain in European-made westerns, spy or mafia films. These flicks - made in the 1960s - were mostly just commercial and Adorf hammed his parts but he did it so brilliantly that he alone made them watchable. From the 1970s on, the quality of his films improved and Adorf could lend his remarkable acting talents to more ambitious works such as \"Il Delitto Matteotti\", in which he was a striking Mussolini, or \"Die Blechtrommel\", where he was terrifying as a boorish grocer contaminated by Nazism. The list of great directors he worked with is impressive: Robert Siodmak, Volker Schlöndorff, Wolgang Staudte, Michel Deville, Dino Risi, Mikhaïl Kalatozov, Luigi Comencini, Peter Fleischmann, Billy Wilder, John Frankenheimer, Claude Chabrol, Fassbinder... Likewise he served many a great author, either in the theatre (Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Richard Nash) or the big or small screen (Grass, Böll, Schnitzler, Heny Miller, Joseph Conrad, Gorky, Patrick Süskind...). He also sang and wrote books (five novels and one memoir). Hyperactive for more than fifty-five years now, Mario Adorf, still in fine form at the age of seventy-eight, is still ... hyperactive!","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDliNTUxZDgtYzVlOS00NzQ2LTk4NjUtZTM5NWNkNDM4N2VjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000728","name":"Mario Adorf","idIMDB":"nm0000728"},"actorId":"nm0000728","character":"Johann Schäfer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Victor Choulman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1945009","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 January 1938","placeOfBirth":" Moscow, Russia","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Victor Choulman was born on January 27, 1938 in Moscow, Russia.
