He won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in The Deer Hunter (1978), and has been seen in mostly supporting roles, often portraying psychologically unstable characters, though that generalization would not do justice to Walken's depth and breadth of performances. Walken was born in Astoria, Queens, to Rosalie (Russell), a Scottish immigrant, and Paul Walken, a German immigrant who ran Walken's Bakery. He learnt his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University & ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\". Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in Me and My Brother (1969), before appearing alongside Sean Connery in the sleeper heist movie The Anderson Tapes (1971). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of Diane Keaton suicidal younger brother in Annie Hall (1977), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying The Deer Hunter (1978). Walken was lured back by The Deer Hunter (1978) director Michael Cimino for a role in the financially disastrous western Heaven's Gate (1980), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in Pennies from Heaven (1981), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the Stephen King inspired The Dead Zone (1983) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure A View to a Kill (1985). Looking at many of Walken's other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in Biloxi Blues (1988), Wayne's World 2 (1993), Joe Dirt (2001), Mousehunt (1997) and America's Sweethearts (2001). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4ODUyNDQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODk2MTYz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000686","name":"Christopher Walken","nicknames":["Chris","Ronnie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000686"},"actorId":"nm0000686","character":"Salvatore 'Sal' Maggio","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020179","main":true},{"actorName":"Marton Csokas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0190744","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxOTcyNDEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMzMzYyNTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1966","placeOfBirth":" Invercargill, New Zealand","height":"6' 1¼\" (1.86 m)","bio":"Marton was born in Invercargill, Aotearoa, to Margaret Christine (Rayner), a nurse, and Márton Csókás, a mechanical engineer. His father is Hungarian and his mother is Australian (of English, Irish, and Danish origin). He inherited some of his talents from his father, a trained opera singer and at one time, a trapeze artist in the Hungarian Circus. His academic training began at Canterbury University, Christchurch, New Zealand, where he commenced a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in Art History, and then transferred to, Te Kura Toi Whakaari o Aotearoa/ The New Zealand Drama School, graduating in December, 1989. His first acting role was in Te Whanau a Tuanui Jones by Apairana Taylor at the Taki Rua Theatre in Wellington New Zealand, (1990). He has since had an eclectic career of theatre, television and film. He appeared in the 1994 movie Jack Brown Genius (1996) in which he played the role of Dennis. After starring for 2 years in the New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street (1992), he starred in the 1996 movie Broken English (1996) as Darko. After performing in a great number of theatrical plays, writing his own and co-founding his own theatre company, the Stronghold Theatre, Marton got the role of Tarlus in an episode of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995). After that, he continued working with Renaissance Pictures, playing the roles of Khrafstar and Borias in the 1997-1998 seasons of Xena: Warrior Princess (1995). He continued appearing in many other shows in both NZ and Australia, such as Farscape (1999), BeastMaster, le dernier des survivants (1999), Brigade des mers (1996), Cleopatra 2525 (2000), and more, returning for the role of Borias in three episodes of the 2000-2001 season of Xena: Warrior Princess (1995). He was also in many movies produced in NZ and Australia, such as Hurrah (1998), Cercle intime (2000) and the mini-series The Farm (2001). He is a citizen of the European Union and Hungary, and is a permanent resident of the United States. Most recently, Csokas starred opposite Denzel Washington in Sony's hit film The Equalizer. He played a brutal fixer for the Russian mafia and a formidable villain to Washington's reluctant hero. Csokas appeared in Darren Aronofsky's Noah as well as Robert Rodriguez's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, a sequel to the 2005 hit film Sin City. Csokas also played the psychiatrist, \"Dr. Kafka,\" in the hit movie sequel, The Amazing Spiderman 2, alongside Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and Jamie Foxx. Csokas most famously starred as \"Lord Celeborn\" in one of the highest-grossing film series of all time, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Some of his other film credits include 2010's The Debt opposite Jessica Chastain and Paul Greengrass' The Bourne Supremacy with Matt Damon. His depth of experience is illustrated in Asylum in which he starred opposite Natasha Richardson and Ian McKellen, as well as the Ridley Scott epic, Kingdom of Heaven, with Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson and Liam Neeson. On the small screen, Csokas recently starred on the History Channel's miniseries Sons of Liberty as well as Discovery Channel's miniseries Klondike with Tim Roth and Sam Shepard. On stage, Csokas continues to work internationally, most recently starring in a production of Lillian Hellman's \"Little Foxes\" at The New York Theatre Workshop by acclaimed director, Ivo van Hove. The play was noted by Time Magazine as one of the \"Top 10 of Everything of 2010.\" The actor has numerous classical credits, including 'Orsino' in Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" at the National Theatre of Great Britain, 'Anthony' in \"Anthony and Cleopatra\" at the Theatre of a New Audience, 'Brutus' in \"Julius Caesar\" and as 'Septimus' in Tom Stoppard's \"Arcadia\" in his birthplace of New Zealand.

Lakers basketball games, Dyan Cannon has enjoyed nearly fifty years in the entertainment industry. Born Samille Diane Friesen in Tacoma, Washington, Cannon had early dreams of becoming an actress. She made her screen debut with a small part in the critically acclaimed crime drama The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond (1960). A short-lived television series called This Rebel Breed (1960) followed that same year. It was during this time that she caught the eye of one of Hollywood's favorite leading men, Cary Grant, who was 35 years her senior. The couple, a hotbed of Hollywood gossip, experienced an on-again, off-again relationship until marrying in 1965. Cannon left her acting career behind during her short-lived marriage to Grant and bore his daughter, Jennifer Grant, in 1966. Cannon and Grant were divorced in 1968, and she returned to the big screen in 1969 in the pop-culture classic Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), garnering an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. A series of less-than-remarkable television and feature films followed in the early 1970s, but comedies proved her most successful medium. Cannon received another Academy Award nomination for Heaven Can Wait (1978), where she played a money-hungry, adulterous wife who hatches a plot to kill her husband only to find that another man has been reincarnated via her husband's body. The multi-talented Cannon, who is also a singer/songwriter, found success behind the camera as well as in front of it. In 1976, she produced, directed, wrote, and edited the short film Number One (1976), an Academy Award nominee for Best Short Film-Live Action. The tedious experience of wearing so many hats deterred her from writing and directing again until 1991, with the release of The End of Innocence (1990). She gave a strong and critically acclaimed performance in the picture, but it received a lukewarm response overall. The 1980s and 1990s found Cannon on the small screen more often than the big one, as she starred in several made-for-TV movies and made guest appearances in numerous series. Most notable was her recurring role on the hit show Ally McBeal (1997), where, in 1997-98, she played Judge Jennifer \"Whipper\" Cone in several episodes of the wacky comedy/drama. Though it's been 20 years since Cannon scored a major movie success and she's outgrown her sexpot image (early nude photos of the actress are still in circulation), she continues to find respectable roles in decent-though-not-great films, most recently Out to Sea (1997) with the aging comedy duo of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon; 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997), That Darn Cat (1997) and Boynton Beach Club (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3Nzc3NTA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTY1MjI1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001007","name":"Dyan Cannon","nicknames":["Frosty"],"idIMDB":"nm0001007"},"actorId":"nm0001007","character":"Anna Carbone","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0509536","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Shannon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788335","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzODk4MjU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYwNjQzMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 August 1974","placeOfBirth":" Lexington, Kentucky, USA","birthName":"Michael Corbett Shannon","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Michael Corbett Shannon was born and raised in Lexington, Kentucky, the son of Geraldine Hine, a lawyer, and Donald Sutherlin Shannon, an accounting professor at DePaul University.

He subsequently relocated to London for a year, and performed on stage in London's West End in such productions as \"Woyzeck\", \"Killer Joe\" and \"Bug\".
