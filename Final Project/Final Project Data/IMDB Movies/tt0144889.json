He became extremely popular in the early 1970's, when he starred opposite Gely Mavropoulou in the phenomenally successful TV series Agnostos polemos (1971), written by Nikos Foskolos.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0031441","name":"Angelos Antonopoulos","idIMDB":"nm0031441"},"actorId":"nm0031441","character":"Kostas","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dimitris Gakidis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1472837","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Dimitris Gakidis is an actor, known for Excursion (1966).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1472837","name":"Dimitris Gakidis","idIMDB":"nm1472837"},"actorId":"nm1472837","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kostas Lahas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1476652","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kostas Lahas is an actor, known for Xanthos ippotis (1977), Sonia (1980) and Excursion (1966).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1476652","name":"Kostas Lahas","idIMDB":"nm1476652"},"actorId":"nm1476652","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nikos Papadopoulos","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2066393","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nikos Papadopoulos is an actor, known for Na zi kaneis i na mi zi?
