See former Jehovah's Witnesses candidly discuss growing up inside the religion. They reveal experiences including the effects of proselytizing door-to-door, shunning non-observant family and friends, suffering the discouragement of pursuing dreams like gaining a higher education, missing other societal holidays and customs. And more... Ultimately the film reveals why Jehovah's Witnesses have the lowest retention rate of any religion with only 37% of those raised as Jehovah's Witnesses continuing their affiliation with the religion. The documentary is the first feature-film directed by Gregorio Smith.","simplePlot":"Documentary about growing up in the Jehovah's Witnesses religion.","actors":[{"actorName":"Janette Anton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5092364","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Janette Anton is an actress, known for Truth Be Told (2012) and The Hunt with John Walsh (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5092364","name":"Janette Anton","idIMDB":"nm5092364"},"actorId":"nm5092364","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Phil Bernardin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3267801","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"He was raised in New York City, though he spent a year in Haiti during his teen years; when he was just a child; and, his dominating presence is tempered by a sincere dedication to help those in need. His love acting began in his early teen years when he was a budding artist and decided he should also try acting. He signed his mother's name to get headshots, though nothing became of them. He forsook his dream of acting to continue his education and help his family when his mother lost her battle with cancer. It wasn't until years later that he decided to pursue his childhood dream: to become a professional actor. He set out in pursuit and, after his very first audition for a part in a short film, won the lead role. This only added impetus to his drive at becoming an accomplished actor. With three goals in mind (obtain an IMDb-credited project, get an appearance on a TV show, and be a part of a web series), it took Him less than two years to achieve them. Whether he's speaking out on behalf of the disadvantaged or promoting cancer awareness (in honor of his beloved mother), He believes in giving it his all. And that's a role of which to be proud.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3267801","name":"Phil
