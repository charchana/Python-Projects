Arquette was born in New York City, New York. Her parents, Lewis Arquette, an actor, and Brenda Denaut (née Nowak), an acting teacher and therapist, had 4 other children: Richmond Arquette, Patricia Arquette, Alexis Arquette, and David Arquette, all actors. Her paternal grandfather, Cliff Arquette, was also an entertainer. Rosanna's mother was from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (from Poland and Russia), while Rosanna's father had French-Canadian, Swiss-German, and English ancestry. Growing up in a family of actors, she began working at a young age. Her first big break came as a teenager with a role in the Movie of the Week The Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978), which starred Bette Davis. Several television roles followed, including an ABC Afterschool Specials (1972) and a part on the series James at 16 (1977) before her talents led to her film debut in Gorp (1980). Since then she has acted in a steady stream of films, including John Sayles' Baby It's You (1983), Fathers & Sons (1992) with Jeff Goldblum, Silverado (1985) (which also featured Goldblum), The Linguini Incident (1991), Martin Scorsese's segment of New York Stories (1989) with Nick Nolte, and many others. She feels particularly proud of her offbeat roles in such independent films as After Hours (1985), Nobody's Fool (1986), and Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), for which she won the British Academy Award. Ms. Arquette was nominated for an Emmy for her work in the controversial The Executioner's Song (1982). She continues her work on television as well as the big screen.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI0MjYxMzQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk0OTE3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000275","name":"Rosanna Arquette","idIMDB":"nm0000275"},"actorId":"nm0000275","character":"Jill Rosen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Vincent Spano","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001759","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNTI4NjIwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ4MzQyNDE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 October 1962","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","birthName":"Vincent M. Spano","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Born in Brooklyn, Vincent developed an interest in acting at a young age and was pursuing it professionally by age 14. A year later, he earned a co-starring role in the play \"The Shadow Box\" and a minor role in the movie The Double McGuffin came two years after that. At age 18, Spano was cast in The Black Stallion Returns after a long and intense audition process (which involved proving that the NYC boy could ride a horse). With this film, he was welcomed into Francis Coppola's Zoetrope family who produced the film. Directly following the profound and exciting experience in which he spent six months out of the country shooting in Italy, Morocco and Algeria, Spano returned home for what many consider to be his \"big break\" - the role of \"The Sheik\" in John Sayles' Italian-Catholic-boy-meets-Jewish-girl romance, Baby It's You. After the films' success, he was thrilled to have the opportunity once again to work with one of his favorite directors, Francis Coppola, in the role of Steve in Rumblefish. In less than a year, Spano had put three major films in the can and had certainly established his career as a \"serious\" film actor. To date, Spano has acted in more than 40 theatrical and television films and has made memorable guest appearances in some of the best shows on television. Spano has won several awards for his work over the years and was nominated as Best Actor for Cable's ACE Award for his role as \"baby mafia\" economic powerhouse Marc Ciuni in Showtime's Blood Ties. Spano was one of the youngest honorees at the Lake Arrowhead film festival, joining the ranks other noted honorees including; Joe Mantegna, Kirk Douglas, and Gena Rowlands. He continues to be recognized in Italy receiving multiple awards alongside great actors like Giancarlo Giannini & Joe Pesci.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNTI4NjIwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ4MzQyNDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001759","name":"Vincent Spano","nicknames":["Vinnie"],"idIMDB":"nm0001759"},"actorId":"nm0001759","character":"Albert 'Sheik' Capadilupo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joanna Merlin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0581008","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYxNTUyNjgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU0MzMxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 July 1931","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Joann Ratner","bio":"Joanna Merlin is an actress and casting director who was born in Chicago, Illinois.
