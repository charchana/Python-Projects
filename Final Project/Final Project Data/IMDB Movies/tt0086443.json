He first became interested in acting after serving three years in the US Air Force and studied at New York's Herbert Berghof Studio. Ward then went to Europe, where he dubbed many Italian movies, and first appeared on-screen in two films by Roberto Rossellini. He then returned to the United States, and got his first decent role alongside Clint Eastwood in the nail-biting prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979). Ward's looks often saw him cast as law enforcement or military characters, and he put in noteworthy performances in Southern Comfort (1981), Uncommon Valor (1983), as astronaut Gus Grissom in The Right Stuff (1983) and scored the lead in the interesting spy / martial arts movie Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins (1985), which unfortunately was not as successful as had been the mega-selling series of Remo Williams books. However, during \"Remo\", Ward demonstrated a great knack for comedic timing and satirical performance, and used this ability was to great effect in several films, including playing Kevin Bacon's fellow giant-worm-fighting handyman in the light-hearted sci-fi hit Tremors (1990), as \"Walter Stuckel\" in Robert Altman's The Player (1992), as TV anchorman \"Chip Daley\" in Tim Robbins' razor-sharp political satire Bob Roberts (1992) and as a vicious, but incompetent, gangster menacing Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult (1994). Ward's abilities as both a strong supporting actor and a truly versatile character actor ensured that he would be in steady demand, and he has continued to turn up in a wide variety of roles utilizing his skills. Keep an eye out for Fred Ward in the action-filled The Chaos Factor (2000), as David Spade's dad in Joe Dirt (2001), in the tongue-in-cheek Corky Romano (2001) and in the Reese Witherspoon romantic tale Sweet Home Alabama (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NDg0MTE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwODQ1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0911542","name":"Fred Ward","idIMDB":"nm0911542"},"actorId":"nm0911542","character":"Lyle Swann","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Belinda Bauer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000873","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5MzE0ODg5NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA0NDk4MDM@._V1_UY44_CR8,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 June 1950","placeOfBirth":" Australia","birthName":"Belinda Jane Taubman","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Belinda Bauer was born Belinda Jane Taubman on June 13, 1950 in Australia. Her family managed Taubman Paints, the country's largest paint manufacturing company. She competed as Belinda Taubman in several beauty contests in Sydney, New South Wales. Starting her career as a ballet dancer and later worked as a model in New York, Bauer became popular in several American cult films of the 1980s, including Winter Kills (1979), The American Success Company (1980), Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann (1982) and Flashdance (1983). Between television work, she also appeared in the comedy film UHF (1989) and the action sequel RoboCop 2 (1990). Her main title roles were in the television films The Sins of Dorian Gray (1983); as Delilah in Samson and Delilah (1984); as an alien woman living on Earth in Starcrossed (1985); and as Christine Scavello in the supernatural thriller Servants of Twilight (1991). Bauer also appeared in the pilot of the television series Supercopter (1984) as Stringfellow Hawke's love interest Gabrielle Ademaur; her character was killed near the series' ending. Her last credited appearance was in the erotic thriller Poison Ivy II (1996). Her portrayals of hard, vindictive women resulted in constant typecasting, which may have contributed to the fading away of her career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5MzE0ODg5NjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA0NDk4MDM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000873","name":"Belinda Bauer","idIMDB":"nm0000873"},"actorId":"nm0000873","character":"Claire Cygne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Coyote","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001075","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NjYwOTczNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA3MzgwMjE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 October 1941","placeOfBirth":" Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Rachmil Pinchus Ben Mosha Cohon","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Peter Coyote was born on October 10, 1941 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA as Rachmil Pinchus Ben Mosha Cohon.

He portrayed an eclectic array of characters over the years, including (but not limited to), authority/military figures, edgy villains, and good-hearted heavies. Many will remember him for his appearance as the stern Captain Wilhelm Knauer in The Longest Yard (1974) (Lauter also made a cameo in the 2005 remake). Lauter also worked with Alfred Hitchcock, Lee Marvin, Burt Lancaster, Jim Carrey and Liam Neeson.

Jones, with his craggy, gaunt looks, first appeared in minor character roles in plenty of WWII films including The Young Lions (1958), The Naked and the Dead (1958), Hell Is for Heroes (1962) and Battle of the Coral Sea (1959). However, 1962 saw him team up with maverick director Sam Peckinpah for the first of Jones' five appearances in his films. Ride the High Country (1962) saw Jones play one of the lowlife Hammond brothers. Next he appeared alongside Charlton Heston in Major Dundee (1965), then Peckinpah cast him, along with his real-life friend Strother Martin, as one of the scummy, murderous bounty hunters in The Wild Bunch (1969). Such was the chemistry between Jones and Martin that Peckinpah teamed them again the following year in The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), and Jones' final appearance in a Peckinpah film was in another western, Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (1973). Two years later Jones directed the cult post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog (1975) starring a young Don Johnson. He has continued to work in Hollywood, and as the lines on his craggy face have deepened, he turns up more frequently as crusty old westerners, especially in multiple TV guest spots. He turned in an interesting performance as a seemingly good ol' boy Nevada cowboy who was actually a powerful behind-the-scenes player in state politics who leaned on Robert De Niro's Las Vegas mob gambler in Martin Scorsese's violent and powerful Casino (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MzQzNDQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMzNzQwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428618","name":"L.Q.
