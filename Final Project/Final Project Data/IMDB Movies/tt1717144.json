She again caught the attention of the international audience for her French speaking role in the international cinematic production '20 Nuits et un Jour du Pluie' (20 Nights and One Rainy Day), which premiered in Cannes in 2000. However, it was her exceptional role in the 1995 popular TV series 'Um die Dreißig' (About 30) that won the hearts of the critics and the nation and catapulted her to become the critically acclaimed actress she is today having played leading roles in more than 50 national and international films. Natalia received her first award, the GOLDEN GONG, in 1996 for her outstanding performance in the episode 'Perfect Mind' of the long-standing crime series Tatort (Crime Scene).
