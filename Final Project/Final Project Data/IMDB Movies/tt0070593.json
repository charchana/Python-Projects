He was born Jacinto Molina Alvarez on September 6, 1934, in Madrid, Spain. His father ran a successful fur business. Naschy grew up during the Spanish Civil War, and sought escape from the real-life horrors around him in adventure comics and movie serials; he often cited seeing Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943) in a theater at age 11 as a seminal inspirational experience (his later movies would be filled with references to it). A talented athlete, Naschy played soccer for the school team and was a weightlifter who became the lightweight champion of Spain in 1958. Moreover, Paul penned Western pulp novels under the pseudonym Jack Mills and worked as an illustrator who did album cover art for a Spanish record label. Thanks to his muscular build, Naschy was able to break into the motion picture business in the early 1960s as an uncredited extra in such films as \"King of the Vikings\"--El príncipe encadenado (1960)--and the biblical epic King of Kings (1961). In 1967 he wrote the script for Frankenstein's Bloody Terror (1968). He was forced, out of necessity, to play the lead role of tormented werewolf Waldermar Daninsky after Lon Chaney Jr. turned it down. He reprised this character in over a dozen subsequent sequels. Naschy's portrayals of the anguished and sympathetic werewolf Daninsky became his signature part and consolidated his enduring cult status as a bona-fide horror icon. Other significant horror figures Paul played were the Mummy, Jack the Ripper, Dracula (his performance as the Prince of Darkness in Count Dracula's Great Love (1973) was one of his personal favorites), the Hunchback, the Frankenstein Monster, the Phantom of the Opera, and even the Devil. Naschy made his directorial debut with Inquisition (1978). The film \"Howl of the Devil\"--El aullido del diablo (1987)--was one of Paul's most personal projects and finest artistic achievements. Naschy had a major heart attack in 1991, but fully recovered and kept soldiering on. He wrote his autobiography, \"Memoirs of a Wolfman,\" in 1997. His career gained new momentum in the early 21st century. Paul was especially memorable as the vicious title character in School Killer (2001) and had an excellent autobiographical leading role as bitter, washed-up veteran horror actor Pablo Thevenet in Rojo sangre (2004). Naschy was inducted into the Fangoria Hall of Fame in 2000 and was the recipient of the Gold Medal Award in Fine Arts in Spain in 2001. Moreover, he also did interviews and commentaries for DVD releases of his movies. Paul was still acting when he died of pancreatic cancer at age 75 on November 30, 2009, in Madrid, Spain. Although he's sadly no longer with us, Naschy's extremely rich, varied and impressive horror cinema legacy will continue to scare, shock, and delight audiences throughout the world for all eternity.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJmM2FmMjUtMTQ2NS00MmZiLWI1N2YtN2MwOWY3NDk5MzBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzAwOTU1MTk@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596701","name":"Paul Naschy","idIMDB":"nm0596701"},"actorId":"nm0596701","character":"Jack Surnett","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Silvia Solar","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0812694","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 March 1940","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Geneviève Couzain","bio":"Silvia Solar was born on March 20, 1940 in Paris, France as Geneviève Couzain.

Born on June 13th in 1929 in Barcelona, Cataluna, Spain, Israel attended the Escuela de actores de la Ciudad Condal. He began acting in films in the early 1960s. Short and dumpy, with a plain, round, pudgy face, thinning hair, medium height and build, snaggle teeth, a benign, humble, unassuming demeanor, and wide, moist, dark saucer eyes, Israel frequently portrayed ordinary working class types, timid cowards, men of the cloth, and meek victims. He soon began making frequent appearances in rugged action films and gritty Italian spaghetti Westerns; he has an especially memorable uncredited part as a weary sergeant at a rundown Confederate fort who Lee Van Cleef talks to in Sergio Leone's magnificent The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, ). In the late 1960s and up until the mid-'80s, Israel acted in an enjoyable slew of spooky horror features and entertainingly trashy exploitation fare. Among his more notable roles are a creepy handyman in The House That Screamed (1970) (The House That Screamed); a slimy, greedy, unctuous cemetery caretaker in The Butcher of Binbrook (1971) (Graveyard of Horror); a craven coachman in Murders in the Rue Morgue (1971); a whistling train baggage handler in the fantastic Horror Express (1972); a near deaf, vaguely menacing innkeeper in El monte de las brujas (1975) (The Witches' Mountain); a despicable and untrustworthy sniveling wimp nightclub owner in the splendidly sleazy Ricco (1973) (The Mean Machine); a scruffy, spineless mountain trail guide in the outrageous Night of the Howling Beast (1975) (Night of the Howling Beast); a zombie priest in Hell of the Living Dead (1980) (Hell of the Living Dead); and a boozy dock night watchman in the laughably lousy The Sea Serpent (1984) (The Sea Serpent). Israel continued to act in both movies and TV shows alike well into his 70s. He died at age 80 from natural causes on September 19, 2009 in Spain.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0411486","name":"Víctor Israel","idIMDB":"nm0411486"},"actorId":"nm0411486","character":"Karl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Kolin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0143162","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"José Coscolin","bio":"Richard Kolin was born as José Coscolin.
