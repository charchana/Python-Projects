McNairy began during the early to mid-2000s, with bit parts in films including Wonderland (2003), Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), and Art School Confidential (2006). He took his first bow as a producer with 2007's In Search of a Midnight Kiss, in which he also starred. That indie romantic comedy concerns a young man (McNairy) all washed up on New Year's Eve -- until an impulsive ad on Craigslist leads him to the great love of his life (Sara Simmonds) and an extraordinary night on the town.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUzMzc1NzM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjAzOTc1NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1058940","name":"Scoot McNairy","nicknames":["Scooter"],"idIMDB":"nm1058940"},"actorId":"nm1058940","character":"Brody Cartwright","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anna Skellern","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1317154","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyNzg1OTQ2ODNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDY2NDE2MjM@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 April 1985","placeOfBirth":" Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","bio":"Anna Skellern was born on April 27, 1985 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
