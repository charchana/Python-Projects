Karl Stegger was born: Carl Johan Stegger Sørensen. He later replaced the \"c\" in his first name with a \"k\" to further his acting-career. He was born in Aarhus on the January 11th 1911. Stegger was educated at Aarhus theatre, where he was hired as an actor for 5 years until 1951. After 1951 he worked at various theatres all around Denmark. But Karl Stegger was mostly famous for his various, and mostly, bi-roles in Danish films and TV. Karl Stegger had his film debut in 1950 with smaller role in [Smedestræde 4]. Stegger subsequently acted in well over 160 films (almost everyone Danish), where he mostly played down-to-earth and sly types. Stegger seldom had a lead part in any film. He became famous in Denmark when he got the part of the father in the Danish film-series: \"Far til Fire\" in 1955, after Ib Schønberg died (who originally had the part). Another famous part he had was as the scrap dealer in \"Olsen-banden i Jylland\" from 1971. In 1971 he got a Danish film-price, a \"Bodil\", for a role as a real-estate salesman in \"Ballade på Christianshavn\". In his later years, Stegger became even more famous for his role as the Swedish-consul in the Danish TV-epic \"Matador\". His last role was in 1980 in \"Trællenes børn\". Karl Stegger died on the 13th of April 1980, he is buried in Søndermark cemetery, Frederiksberg.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0825234","name":"Karl Stegger","idIMDB":"nm0825234"},"actorId":"nm0825234","character":"Caretaker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Per Goldschmidt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0073155","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 March 1943","placeOfBirth":" Copenhagen, Denmark","bio":"Per Goldschmidt was born on March 11, 1943 in Copenhagen, Denmark.
