If you have heard the name \"Area 51\", it is due in part to his successful efforts to publicize the base in the mid-1990s. In 1993, having found some modest success in computer software, Glenn moved to the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada to devote himself full-time to exploring this unacknowledged government facility. Featured in a major article in the New York Times Sunday magazine in 1994, Glenn soon hosted dozens of journalists and appeared in countless news broadcasts as an Area 51 expert. The highlight of his early television career was an appearance on \"UFO Cover-Up Live\", a live two-hour broadcast by Larry King from the desert outside the base. He also appeared on \"The Montel Williams Show\", several national news magazine shows, such as \"CBS Sunday Morning\", and on the first paranormal TV series of the cable TV era, \"Sightings\" and \"Encounters\". In all his TV appearances, Glenn served as both as an on-screen expert and as an off-screen location fixer, supplying producers and film crews with essential information about the local area. Glenn helped many TV crews pull off complex expeditions in the remote desert with few hitches. Glenn withdrew from the public eye in the early 2000s to explore marriage and family but returned in 2009 as an on-screen guide and off-screen consultant for the Area 51 episode of the History Channel's \"UFO Hunters\", which became the highest rated episode of the series. Since then, Glenn has appeared on paranormal and news shows about once a year, mainly drawing upon his Area 51 expertise from the 1990s. (Glenn is no longer an active Area 51 researcher.) His latest appearances are on German and Danish TV networks. Glenn now considers himself a UFO agnostic. He can't say definitively whether or not aliens exist, only that they are not currently relevant to our life on Earth. A former airline employee and obsessive traveler, Glenn now lives continuously on the road without any fixed residence. As of February 2017, he has visited 78 countries. He has self-produced several full-length travel shows on YouTube, including visits to Kazakhstan and Arctic Norway. His stunning photos and videos from around the world are found on Instagram (2 accounts). He posts to Instagram, Facebook and Twitter almost every day, and to YouTube about once a week. He is \"BadDalaiLama\" on most social media platforms. Glenn is also an author. His book \"The Case Against Marriage,\" has been published in both English and Turkish. He is the author of two self-published novels, including \"Harper Junction\", the story of an inch-high young man who lives on a basement train set.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MTQ2ODQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU0NDM1OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3270405","name":"Glenn Campbell","nicknames":["Bad Dalai Lama"],"idIMDB":"nm3270405"},"actorId":"nm3270405","character":"Glenn Campbell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Conception West","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428625","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Conception West is an actress, known for Area 51 (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428625","name":"Conception West","idIMDB":"nm7428625"},"actorId":"nm7428625","character":"Little A'Le'Inn Waitress","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Decker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428626","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Decker is an actor, known for Area 51 (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428626","name":"James Decker","idIMDB":"nm7428626"},"actorId":"nm7428626","character":"Kooky Rachel Local","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Sullivan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428627","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Patrick Sullivan is an actor, known for Area 51 (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428627","name":"Patrick Sullivan","idIMDB":"nm7428627"},"actorId":"nm7428627","character":"Lazar's Insider Security","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Thornsberry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861477","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"David Thornsberry is known for his work on Almost Famous (2000), Bruce Almighty (2003) and The Maze Runner (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861477","name":"David Thornsberry","idIMDB":"nm0861477"},"actorId":"nm0861477","character":"Employee","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jenna Thornsberry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428628","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jenna Thornsberry is an actress, known for Area 51 (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428628","name":"Jenna Thornsberry","idIMDB":"nm7428628"},"actorId":"nm7428628","character":"Area 51 Employee's Wife","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Amelia Thornsberry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428629","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Amelia Thornsberry is an actress, known for Area 51 (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7428629","name":"Amelia Thornsberry","idIMDB":"nm7428629"},"actorId":"nm7428629","character":"Employee Daughter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wray Featherstone","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269970","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Wray Featherstone is known for his work on 127 Hours (2010), High School Musical (2006) and The World's Fastest Indian (2005).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269970","name":"Wray Featherstone","idIMDB":"nm0269970"},"actorId":"nm0269970","character":"Reid's Dad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sandra Staggs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1036889","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3ODUwNDU2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM3NTc0NDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Sandra Rae Kildron","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Sandra Staggs hails from the Big Easy. One of five children, she began performing at a very early age. Her first Equity Theatre performance was at the age of ten in Virginia, where she played Alice in Alice Through The Looking Glass; at that moment her mother knew Sandra was destined to take a road less traveled, a path which would lead to multiple careers in the entertainment business. Sandra attended Louisiana State University, Monroe on a theatre and debate scholarship where she won numerous national awards in dramatic interpret and poetry. While attending she had the opportunity to work with the late Andy Devine and Mercedes McCambridge, as well as Chita Rivera. She graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond with a B.S. degree in Marketing. After a long career as a cable television executive Sandra moved to New York to further the dream she had so many years before to become an actress. In New York she attended the New York School for Film & Television where she studied with Joan See and The Acting Studio under the direction of Bob McAndrews. Her work in New York paid off after she submitted a tape to Spelling for a small role on Melrose Place, which led to her move to Los Angeles in 1998. As an actress, Sandra kicked off 2009 in Buenos Aires where she shot a commercial for Coca-Cola Zero for release in Europe and South Africa. Her comedic skills caught the eye of talented Danish commercial director Martin Werner after a massive casting search for her character was conducted in Los Angeles, New York City, Paris and Buenos Aires. Sandra just wrapped shooting Hold On Loosely, an irreverent southern comedy written and directed by Josh Cole. Sandra created the role of Nurse Edna, the sexy, on-the-make nurse in a small town hospital. The comedy has a stellar ensemble cast of newcomers. Sandra is in post production for Without Borders (2011), a suspense/drama written and directed by Nick Gaitatjis. She serves as producer on the Greek language picture, which shot in three countries over several months. The film will be released by Village Roadshow in the fall of 2009. Sandra also co-stars in the film as the Consulate General at the American Embassy in Athens, Greece. Her character's critical decision in the story sets the protagonist on a journey to find out how far he will go for love. Prior to those most recent performances, this Louisiana native brought her southern charm and sultry beauty to the starring role of Josephine in the hit teen comedy Gettin' It (2006), also written and directed by Nick Gaitatjis. Sandra's comic portrayal of the worried mother of a clumsy teenage virgin with raging hormones personifies every mother's nightmare as they watch their children grow up. Following her success she co-starred in Faith Happens (2006), directed by Rick Garside, a hard-hitting drama that takes the viewer on a personal journey from the heart to the soul. Sandra also worked alongside Christopher Stapleton in the award-winning short film November (2005) directed by Rick Short. Her depiction of the wife of a newly-elected President who discovers the truth about his election is chilling and compelling. In the field of radio, Sandra co-founded the 2 Hearts Radio Show which premiered in 2006 on CRN Digital Talk Radio. The 2 Hearts show can be heard every Sunday night on CRN which is carried in over 24 million homes nationwide by all major cable television companies as well as several top radio markets including Boston and Philadelphia. The 2 Hearts show provides a refreshing, irreverent new voice for women on talk radio. Infused with humor, heart and candor, the show presents a daring new take on the issues that touch women's minds and hearts - namely men, love, sex and plastic surgery! A distinguished voice-over artist recognized primarily for her deep, sexy voice, Sandra has lent her signature silky reads to many top commercial campaigns. Her broad vocal range and training as an actor make her a much sought-after VO talent for ADR loop groups for features and made-for-TV movies. Sandra is also a 14-year cable industry veteran in marketing, advertising, publicity and sales. For the past eleven years she has worked in film and television, where her emphasis has been in the creation, development and financing of films and reality programming for domestic and international distribution. As Head of Marketing and Publicity at Fireworks Pictures, Sandra worked with Paramount Pictures and Paramount Classics, where her role was essential to the successful international release of many films. Working with film distributors all over the world, Sandra was responsible for the creation of the international marketing and publicity strategies of the aforementioned films. Sandra moved on to head television endeavors for Melwood Pictures, helmed by animation veteran Max Howard, where she was responsible for establishing links with co-production partners to develop top quality animated television series for network and cable. In 2002, Sandra formed her own production company with partner Anne Aaronson to create and develop scripted and reality TV projects for cable and network television. Staggs/Aaronson partnered with Western International Syndication on several reality shows prior to focusing on 2 Hearts Entertainment, a distributor of sensual international programming targeted primarily towards women and couples. 2 Hearts will launch in Canada fall of 2009 on Rogers Cable. Sandra continues to serve as a consultant for independent film companies with a focus on international marketing, sales and distribution. In the past she has worked for such companies as Myriad Pictures, Renegade and Seven Arts International. Throughout the years Sandra taught ballroom dancing for Arthur Murray and Fred Astaire studios. Her dance repertoire includes all of the Latin styles, plus the Waltz, Polka and Foxtrot. In her youth she was a competitive baton twirler winning many regional and national titles. Sandra makes her home in Los Angeles and includes frequent trips to the South to stay close to her roots.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3ODUwNDU2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM3NTc0NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1036889","name":"Sandra Staggs","idIMDB":"nm1036889"},"actorId":"nm1036889","character":"Reid's Mom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1519461","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1519461","business":{"budget":{"money":"$5,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[null,null],"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 31 min (91 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital","Datasat"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.2","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Santa Clarita, California, USA"}],"rated":"R","awards":[],"votes":"8,674","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0203328","name":"Aramid Entertainment Fund"},{"idCompany":"co0098315","name":"Blumhouse Productions"},{"idCompany":"co0208137","name":"IM Global"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["conspiracy","secret base","ufo","area 51","alien","fake documentary","security system","laboratory","climbing a fence","alien space craft","hiding","alien technology","military base","breaking and entering","night vision","alien abduction","friendship between men","scene after end credits","actress shares first name with character","locker room","gas mask","urination","title appears in writing","dog","following someone","airport","photograph","storage facility","storage unit","map","hidden camera","topless female nudity","lap dance","strip club","disappearance","thermal imaging","hotel","taser","power outage","karaoke","interview","nonlinear timeline","character repeating someone else's dialogue","no opening credits","las vegas nevada","video camera","party","cave","helicopter","rattlesnake","desert","foot chase","secret project","flying saucer","alarm","antenna","blood","levitation","suv","handheld camera","government employee","extraterrestrial","beer pong","male rear nudity","found footage","subjective camera","written by director","actor shares first name with character","title spoken by character","number in title","swimming pool","cell phone","paranoia","bloody nose","bare chested male"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 08:46:59"}}
