Sharon grew up in a few extremely repressive small towns in the Midwest. When Thorpe was twelve her parents began collecting various books about sex, thereby installing in Thorpe the basic belief that sex is both healthy and natural. Sharon went to New York at age seventeen to attend college. Following graduation from college Thorpe moved to San Francisco, California and worked as a secretary. Sharon became involved in the adult entertainment industry in the early 1970's after a friend of hers answered a newspaper ad for a hardcore movie. Although her friend ultimately got cold feet, Thorpe nonetheless decided to check the whole thing out after taking a phone call from the filmmakers to the place where Thorpe and her friend both worked. Sharon was often paired with John Leslie. Thorpe gave an especially moving and impressive performance as the painfully shy and timid Lisa Hill in SexWorld (1978). Sharon was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame in 1985.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861711","name":"Sharon Thorpe","idIMDB":"nm0861711"},"actorId":"nm0861711","character":"Lisa Hill","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Leslie","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504126","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 January 1945","placeOfBirth":" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"John Leslie Nuzzo","bio":"A veteran of over three decades in the X-film business, John Leslie has acted in, directed and produced hundreds of films.

She was born Annette Robinson on December 1, 1954 in Las Vegas, Nevada, and raised in a sexually conservative Mormon family. She worked when adult films were still shot on film and not videotape. Before entering adult films, she had worked in a variety of fields: nurse's aide, exotic dancer, massage parlor employee in the San Francisco area. She worked on her first adult film in the mid-1970s. Her regal (and somewhat aloof) bearing got her often cast as an angelic-looking virgin or femme fatale. Not only was she considered one of the best looking women in the industry, she could also act, as evidenced by her adult film best actress award from A Coming of Angels (1977). Her feminist streak seems strange considering the business she was in, but she refused to do scenes that included violence or \"money shots\". She even turned down a role in the horror movie The Howling (1981) because of its excessive violence. However, she did do a role in the mystery thriller Body Double (1984), proving she could go mainstream. She starred in many adult classics like Barbara Broadcast (1977), 'V': The Hot One (1978) and A Thousand and One Erotic Nights (1982). She retired from adult films in late 1980s, her legendary reputation intact, and resides in Mill Valley, California with her husband.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369749","name":"Annette Haven","idIMDB":"nm0369749"},"actorId":"nm0369749","character":"Dale","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Johns","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2742645","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Peter Johns is an actor.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2742645","name":"Peter Johns","idIMDB":"nm2742645"},"actorId":"nm2742645","character":"Lisa's Caller","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Amber Hunt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0402337","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Striking and shapely long-haired blonde Amber Hunt was without a doubt one of the most beautiful and sensual porn starlets to emerge during the 1970's Golden Age of Adult Cinema.

Her father was a doctor. She gave an impressive lead performance in her film debut as the eager innocent adolescent who experiences a sexual awakening in the excellent and highly erotic teen coming-of-age feature Dixie (1976). A youthful-looking brunette with small but sweet and perky breasts, lovely big eyes, a large, yet luscious frame, auburn hair, silky skin and a slight (and incredibly sexy) overbite, Abigail was one of the most appealing and attractive female stars of the Golden Age of Porn. Her lusty and steamy contributions to such classic pictures as Naked Afternoon (1976), Desires Within Young Girls (1977), 7 Into Snowy (1978) and SexWorld (1978) were always quite arousing and enjoyable. Moreover, she also appeared in a few \"mainstream\" movies: she starred alongside Gérard Depardieu in Bye Bye Monkey (1978), was especially memorable as a hapless model who gets brutally murdered by vicious psychotic Joe Spinell in the notorious horror slasher cult favorite Maniac (1980) and had a small part as a nun in the comedy So Fine (1981). Abigail quit appearing in hardcore films in 1980.
