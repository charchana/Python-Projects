During her childhood, her family moved to Orlando, Florida, where she was raised. She has Russian Jewish (from her maternal grandfather), English, and some Scottish and Irish, ancestry. After seeing the musical \"Oklahoma!\", she decided that she wanted to pursue a career in singing. As a child, she performed the National Anthem at several athletic events around her hometown of Orlando, Florida, and became known as the \"National Anthem girl\". At the ripe age of 14, while she was recording in a studio in Orlando, a Fed-Ex worker who happened to be passing through heard her and was interested in her talent. He happened to know someone at Sony as well. Moore worked on cutting a demo and shortly thereafter signed a record deal with Sony 550 Music. At 15, her first record \"So Real\" was released. Her first tour was with the Backstreet Boys. As her touring and recording schedule demanded more of her time, Moore withdrew from Bishop Moore Catholic High School in Orlando and opted for a tutor/correspondence. She has stated that her education is important to her and says that the fact that she wants to go to college motivates her to continue with her schooling. Though Moore's record sales were not up in the ranks of Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, she has proved to be a formidable talent both in singing and in acting, and snagged an MTV Movie Award in June 2002 for her first feature film role in A Walk to Remember (2002). Her biggest dream, though, is to perform on Broadway someday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NTEzNDgzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMwNjk4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601553","name":"Mandy Moore","idIMDB":"nm0601553"},"actorId":"nm0601553","character":"Rapunzel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028364","main":true},{"actorName":"Zachary Levi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1157048","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyNTAzMTA4OTJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA4NDI2Njk@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 September 1980","placeOfBirth":" Lake Charles, Louisiana, USA","birthName":"Zachary Levi Pugh","height":"6' 3¼\" (1.91 m)","bio":"The middle child between two sisters, Zachary Levi was born as Zachary Levi Pugh, on September 29, 1980, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Susan (Hoctor) and Darrell Pugh.

Ronald N. Perlman was born April 13, 1950 in Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York. His mother, Dorothy (Rosen), is retired from the City Clerk's Office. His father, Bertram \"Bert\" Perlman, now deceased, was a repairman and a drummer. His parents were both from Jewish families (from Hungary, Germany and Poland). With a career spanning over three decades, Perlman has worked alongside such diverse actors as Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Dominique Pinon, Brad Dourif, Ed Harris, John Hurt, Jude Law, Christina Ricci, Federico Luppi, Sigourney Weaver, Michael Wincott and Elijah Wood to name a few. While he has never been a bankable star, Perlman has always had a large fanbase. He started out strong as Amoukar, one of the tribesmen in Jean-Jacques Annaud's Academy Award-winning film Quest for Fire (1981), for which he earned a Genie Award nomination. Perlman teamed up with Annaud again, this time as a hunchback named Salvatore in The Name of the Rose (1986). His first real breakthrough came later when he landed the role of the noble lion-man Vincent, opposite Linda Hamilton on the fantasy series Beauty and the Beast (1987). His work in this role earned him not only a Golden Globe Award but an underground fan following. Sadly the series was cancelled in its third season shortly after Hamilton's character's death. After that, he spent time doing supporting work on television and independent films such as Guillermo del Toro's debut Cronos (1993) (where a lifelong friendship and collaboration between the director and Perlman would blossom) as Angel and his first lead role as One in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's surreal The City of Lost Children (1995). His first real big role in a mainstream film came when Jeunet wanted him for the brutish Johner in his first Hollywood outing Alien: Resurrection (1997). Perlman has also used his distinctive voice to his advantage, appearing in many animated films/series, commercials and he is a video game fan favorite because of his work on such games as the Fallout series. It was not until much later he received worldwide fame when his good friend Guillermo del Toro helped him land the title role in the big-budget comic book movie Hellboy (2004). Del Toro fought the studio for four years because they wanted a more secure name, but he stood his ground and in 2004, after almost 25 years in and out of obscurity, Perlman became and household name and a sought out actor. Perlman has had one of the most offbeat careers in film, playing everything from a prehistoric ape-man to an aging transsexual and will always be a rarity in Hollywood. Other notable roles include the cunning Norman Arbuthnot in The Last Supper (1995), sniper expert Koulikov in Enemy at the Gates (2001), vampire leader Reinhardt in Blade II (2002), his reprisal of Hellboy in Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) and biker chief Clarence Morrow on the popular series Sons of Anarchy (2008). He currently resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Opal, and their two children, Blake and Brandon.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NzAzMTEyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYwMzYwNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000579","name":"Ron Perlman","idIMDB":"nm0000579"},"actorId":"nm0000579","character":"Stabbington Brother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0222627","main":true},{"actorName":"M.C.

Tambor was born and raised in San Francisco, to Eileen (Salzberg) and Michael Bernard Tambor, a flooring contractor. His family is Ashkenazi Jewish (from Hungary and Ukraine). He studied acting at San Francisco State University and earned his Bachelors of Arts degree there. Following his Masters at Wayne State University, he started building up his resume in repertory theater. He was first seen on episodic TV in the mid-'70s in both comedies (Taxi (1978), Barney Miller (1974)) and dramas (Kojak (1973), Starsky and Hutch (1975)). A large, somewhat looming fellow, his sly-eyed look and leering gaze, matched with a bright set of pearly teeth and stark pattern baldness, made him a natural for broad, warped comedy. The folks at Three's Company (1976) brought Jeffrey back time and time again, standing toe-to-toe with John Ritter and stealing many of their scenes with his noticeably bizarre gents. Before his \"Three's Company\" guest roles, he co-starred in the show's spin-off The Ropers (1979) with Norman Fell and Audra Lindley. He and Patty McCormack played the Ropers' chagrined neighbors. On the legitimate stage, he has been an earnest player over the years with performances in \"Sly Fox\" and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" on Broadway in addition to roles in \"Measure for Measure,\" \"A Flea in Her Ear\" and \"The Seagull.\" On the side, Jeffrey has directed a number of stage productions and teaches acting in the Los Angeles area. Although not as well known for his film work, he made a strong dramatic impression in his film debut ...and justice for all. (1979), in which he played Al Pacino's half-crazed law partner. He went on to enhance a number of other movies including The Dream Chasers (1984), Mr. Mom (1983), Brenda Starr (1989), Radioland Murders (1994), Doctor Dolittle (1998), Pollock (2000). More recently he played the Mayor of Whoville in How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). Emmy-nominated for his quirky work on The Larry Sanders Show (1992), Jeffrey's fondness and talent for the weird and wacky has recently found a nesting roost. Quite at home amid the insanity in the series Arrested Development (2003), he recently copped another Emmy nomination as the patriarch of the highly dysfunctional Bluth family.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQxMzA3NzQzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQxMDc3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001787","name":"Jeffrey Tambor","idIMDB":"nm0001787"},"actorId":"nm0001787","character":"Big Nose Thug","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0230105","main":true},{"actorName":"Brad Garrett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004951","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMjYyMjYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MDU3ODE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 April 1960","placeOfBirth":" Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Brad H.

He began performing his act at various Los Angeles comedy clubs, getting his start at the Ice House in Pasadena and the Improv in Hollywood. In 1984, he became the first $100,000 grand champion winner in the comedy category of Star Search (1983). This led to his first appearance, at age 23, on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), making him one of the youngest comedians ever to perform on the show. In 1986, Garrett told a joke the talent booker warned him against and he hasn't been on the show since. Following his \"Tonight Show\" appearance, Garrett's career took off, garnering him headlining gigs at several national venues as well as opening spots for legends including Diana Ross and Liza Minnelli. He has headlined at Bally's Park Place and co-headlined with The Temptations at Trump Plaza.

Kiel worked in numerous jobs including as a night club bouncer and a cemetery plot salesman, before breaking into film & TV in several minor roles in the late 1950s / early 1960s. Noted amongst these was the alien \"Kanamit\" in the classic The Twilight Zone (1959) episode \"To Serve Man\", and terrorizing Arch Hall Jr. while clad in a loincloth in the prehistoric caveman meets virile teenage drama Eegah (1962). Kiel turned up in two episodes of the classic horror TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker (1974). On one occasion playing a Native American evil spirit with the ability to transform into various animals. On his second appearance, Kiel was unrecognizable as a Spanish moss covered, Louisiana swamp monster brought to life by a patient involved in deep sleep therapy. However, his biggest break came in 1977 when he was cast as the unstoppable, steel toothed henchman \"Jaws\" in the finest Roger Moore film of the Bond series The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Such was Kiel's popularity with movie audiences, that his character was brought back for the next Bond outing Moonraker (1979). However, audiences were quite split on opinions when Kiel's \"Jaws\" character changes sides near the film's conclusion and assists 007, Roger Moore, in saving the Earth. Over the next few years, Kiel appeared in relatively non-demanding comedy or fantasy type films taking advantage of his physical stature and presence. Kiel then decided to try his hand behind the camera and co-wrote and produced, plus took the lead role, in the well received family movie The Giant of Thunder Mountain (1991). Demand for Kiel's unique attributes dropped very sharply in the 1990's, leading to only a handful of roles including reprising his \"Jaws\" character in the Matthew Broderick film Inspector Gadget (1999). In 2002, Kiel penned his informative autobiography entitled \"Making it BIG in the movies\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MjI0NTA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTMzMTEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001423","name":"Richard Kiel","idIMDB":"nm0001423"},"actorId":"nm0001423","character":"Vlad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0231685","main":true},{"actorName":"Delaney Rose Stein","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4169896","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MzQyMjU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM0OTA2MDI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Delaney Rose Stein is an actress, known for Tangled (2010) and Circus (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MzQyMjU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM0OTA2MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4169896","name":"Delaney Rose Stein","idIMDB":"nm4169896"},"actorId":"nm4169896","character":"Young Rapunzel / Little Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028364","main":true},{"actorName":"Nathan Greno","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1977355","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzODM1NTg5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUwNDE0NDE@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 March 1975","placeOfBirth":" Kenosha, Wisconsin, USA","bio":"Nathan Greno was born in Kenosha, Wisc., on the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan. As a child, he developed a love for drawing, which quickly evolved into a passion for visual storytelling. Influenced by comic books and newspaper comic strips, he started filling tablets of paper full of sketches. He began creating his own characters, his own worlds and story lines. It was his frequent trips to the local movie theater that planted the seed for a future career at Walt Disney Animation Studios. He made sure to see all of Disney's classic animated films on the big screen. Animation was quickly becoming his favorite form of visual storytelling, so at the ripe old age of 8, he just knew he wanted to work for Disney. Greno devoted himself to discovering all there was to know about the art of animation. He continued to create his own characters, crudely animating them in the pages of his school textbooks. In 1989, a family trip to Walt Disney World gave him his first real glimpse of animators at work. It was there that he watched the artists breathe life into their characters and he was more determined than ever to continue on his path to joining the Disney family. He went on to attend the Columbus College of Art and Design in Columbus, Ohio. In 1996, Greno's portfolio was accepted by Walt Disney Animation Studios in Florida. His career started as a clean-up animation artist on \"Mulan.\" Having never lost his affinity for storytelling, he soon became obsessed with the storyboarding process at the studio. He realized that storyboarding was similar to the comic books and comic strips he grew up reading and creating. Pursuing his new interest, Greno joined the story department in 1998. He was part of the story team on short film \"John Henry\" and feature-length \"Brother Bear.\" He relocated to California in 2003, where he continued to work in the story department and in a variety of other capacities. He served as a screenwriter, story artist and voice actor on \"Meet the Robinsons\" and was then promoted to head of story on \"Bolt.\" In that role, he oversaw the story of the film, managed the story crew and their sequences, while also storyboarding. He made his directorial debut with the short film, \"Super Rhino,\" which was featured as an exclusive on the \"Bolt\" Blu-Ray/DVD. He also lent his voice talent to Dasher the Reindeer in Disney's 2009 animated holiday special \"Prep and Landing.\" Greno went on to direct the 2010 hit \"Tangled,\" Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature, with fellow director Byron Howard. According to John Lasseter, chief creative offices for Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, Greno and Howard created a movie that can sit on the shelf next to classic Disney animated films, while also being an entertaining roller coaster ride for modern audiences. In 2012, the Greno and Howard once again joined forces for \"Tangled Ever After,\" a short film and continuation of the \"Tangled\" story that saw the kingdom abuzz over the royal wedding of Rapunzel and Flynn Rider. Since, Greno has contributed to Walt Disney Animation Studios' two Academy Award®-winning feature length films, as an additional story artist on \"Frozen\" (2013) and a creative advisor for \"Big Hero 6\" (2014). Greno resides in the hills of Los Feliz, Calif., just down the street from Walt Disney's old house, with his fiancée Colie. His favorite film of all time is and always will be \"Dumbo.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzODM1NTg5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUwNDE0NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1977355","name":"Nathan Greno","idIMDB":"nm1977355"},"actorId":"nm1977355","character":"Guard 1 / Thug 1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Byron Howard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397174","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MTUzNDYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgyMzA4MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 December 1968","placeOfBirth":" Misawa, Japan","birthName":"Byron P.
