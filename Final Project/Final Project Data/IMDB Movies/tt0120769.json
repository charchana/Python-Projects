His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Scottish, Irish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father's oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film. He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Dazed and Confused (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger. Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham's novel A Time to Kill (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry's hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew's birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998). In 1999, he starred in the comedy Edtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine. In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as Un mariage trop parfait (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Reign of Fire (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Fool's Gold (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies. That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey's career certainly reached it's prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO's True Detective (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics' Choice Award for the role. Later in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MDc3ODUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk2NjY4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190","name":"Matthew McConaughey","idIMDB":"nm0000190"},"actorId":"nm0000190","character":"Willis Newton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0025066","main":true},{"actorName":"Skeet Ulrich","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000240","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMjk5OTAyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzUxNzA1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 January 1970","placeOfBirth":" Lynchburg, Virginia, USA","birthName":"Bryan Ray Trout","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Skeet Ulrich was born on January 20, 1970 in Lynchburg, Virginia, USA as Bryan Ray Trout.

His parents were students at the University of Texas at the time but divorced when Ethan was 5 years old. His mother raised him alone for the next five years, moving around the country, until she remarried in 1981 and the family settled in Princeton Junction, New Jersey. He attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and then transferred to the Hun School of Princeton and it was while he was there that he began taking acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus. His early ambition had been to be a writer, but as a result of the acting lessons and appearances in student productions he persuaded his mother to allow him to attend an audition for a role in a sci-fi adolescent adventure, Explorers (1985). He got the part (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for a few years. He was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society (1989) and he didn't complete his degree. His subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony nomination for his role in The Coast of Utopia at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of \"serious\" and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Training Day (2001). Meanwhile, he also pursued his childhood ambition and has written two novels and several screenplays.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NDMxMTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE3ODE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000160","name":"Ethan Hawke","idIMDB":"nm0000160"},"actorId":"nm0000160","character":"Jess Newton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0025067","main":true},{"actorName":"Gail Cronauer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0188687","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NTk1MjI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ3MzEzMTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 December 1948","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Gail Cronauer was born on December 23, 1948 in Dallas, Texas, USA.

He is of Italian descent and has two older sisters. He studied at the Actors Studio and the American Stanislavski Theatre. Vincent D'Onofrio is known as an \"actor's actor\". The wide variety of roles he has played and the quality of his work have earned him a reputation as a versatile talent. His first paid role was in Off-Broadway's \"This Property Is Condemned\". He continued appearing in plays and worked as a bouncer, a bodyguard and a delivery man. In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in \"Open Admissions\", followed by work in numerous other stage plays. In 2012, D'Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theater & Film Institute. As a film actor, D'Onofrio's career break came when he played a mentally unbalanced recruit in Full Metal Jacket (1987), directed by the renowned Stanley Kubrick. For this role D'Onofrio gained nearly 70 pounds. He had a major role in Dying Young (1991), and appeared prominently in the box-office smash Men in Black (1997) as the bad guy (Edgar \"The Bug\"). Other films of note in which he has appeared are Mystic Pizza (1988), JFK (1991), The Player (1992), Ed Wood (1994), The Cell (2000), The Break-Up (2006) and Jurassic World (2015). In 1996, D'Onofrio garnered critical acclaim along with co-star Renée Zellweger for The Whole Wide World (1996), which he helped produce. He also made a guest appearance in Homicide: Life on the Street: The Subway (1997), where he played an accident victim who could not be rescued and was destined to die. For this performance he won an Emmy nomination. In 2000, he both produced and starred in Steal This Movie (2000), a biopic of radical leader Abbie Hoffman. In 2001, D'Onofrio took the role which has likely given him his greatest public recognition: Det. Robert Goren, the lead character in the TV series Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001). Goren is based on Sherlock Holmes but, instead of relying upon physical evidence like Holmes, D'Onofrio's character focuses on psychology to identify the perpetrators, whom he often draws into confessing or yielding condemning evidence. He played the part for 10 years. In his career D'Onofrio's various film characters have included a priest, a bisexual former porn star, a hijacker, a serial killer, Orson Welles, a space alien, a 1960s radical leader, a pulp fiction writer, an ingenious police investigator and Stuart Smalley's dope-head brother. His on-screen love interests have included Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Renée Zellweger, Marisa Tomei, Tracey Ullman, Rebecca De Mornay and Lili Taylor. One of his latest roles is in Marvel's Daredevil (2015) as Daredevil's nemesis, Wilson Fisk. He lives in Manhattan with his wife and children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTE2MDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUzMjcz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000352","name":"Vincent D'Onofrio","nicknames":["The Human Chameleon","Noffy"],"idIMDB":"nm0000352"},"actorId":"nm0000352","character":"Dock Newton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0025068","main":true},{"actorName":"Jena Karam","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0438838","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jena Karam is an actress, known for The Newton Boys (1998).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0438838","name":"Jena Karam","idIMDB":"nm0438838"},"actorId":"nm0438838","character":"Orphan Singer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Julianna Margulies","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000523","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MTgxOTgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxOTAwMDE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 June 1966","placeOfBirth":" Spring Valley, New York, USA","birthName":"Julianna Luisa Margulies","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Julianna Margulies was born on June 8, 1966 in Spring Valley (near New York City), as the youngest of three daughters of Francesca (Goldberg), a teacher and dancer in American Ballet, and Paul Margulies, an advertising writer and philosopher.

He has risen from hot country star to being one of country music's biggest influences. While doing that, he has also become a critically acclaimed actor. Dwight Yoakam was born in the coal mining community of Pikeville, Kentucky, October 23, 1956. Soon after his birth, his family moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he was raised. As part of the Drama Club in his days at Northland High School in Columbus, he acted in school plays. He played Helen Keller's brother in his sophomore year in the school's production of \"The Miracle Worker.\" He followed that his Junior year playing the lead as Charlie in \"Flowers for Algernon.\" He capped off his high school acting career as Richard Bravo in The \"Demon Seed.\" In 1977, Dwight moved to Nashville to pursue a career in music. At the time, Nashville was moving away from the traditional country sound that he was playing. After a brief time there, he moved to California, which was more receptive to the music he was doing. He hooked up with producer/guitar virtuoso Pete Anderson in 1982. That began a musical relationship that became country music's equivalent to rock's Glimmer Twins (Mick Jagger and Keith Richards). Financial backing to make a high-quality recording came from Dwight's sister and brother-in-law, an insurance check that was meant to fix Dwight's El Camino and money raised from a benefit classical music concert staged by UCLA music professor Dr. Robert Winter. With the EP (extended play) that captured the \"Dwight Yoakam sound.\" In 1984, Dwight released the six-song EP \"Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.\" on the independent Oak label, and then hit the road with such artists as Los Lobos and Violent Femmes. Playing traditional country music, Dwight gained a following among not only country fans but punk rockers and rockabilly fans as well. This eclectic fan base brought him to the attention of many record labels. Warner Brothers signed him to its newly revived Reprise Record label in 1985. The EP's title and tracks were kept intact and more songs added to make a full album. At the time, country music was in the waning days of its Urban Cowboy (1980) phase, and fans of country were hungry for something \"new.\" This new sound was a return to a more traditional style that had been abandoned when John Travolta put on a cowboy hat. After establishing himself in the music industry, Dwight set his sights on his second love, acting. In 1991 he appeared as a stuntman/country singer in an episode of P.S.I. Luv U (1991). This became the beginning of his professional acting career. In 1992, he appeared on the big screen for the first time in the Nicolas Cage/Dennis Hopper film Red Rock West (1993). In 1993, Dwight released what is considered his masterpiece, the album \"This Time.\" He supported the album with a tour that lasted over a year and covered the world. In 1994, he received his first Grammy for the album's single, \"Ain't That Lonely Yet.\" In 1996, he co-starred in Billy Bob Thornton's film Sling Blade (1996). His work as the evil Doyle Hargraves left audiences speechless and critics hailing his performance. Dwight was included with the cast who were among the nominees for \"Best Cast\" by the Screen Actors Guild awards. As the 1990s drew to a close, Dwight proved that his music didn't have to suffer as he pursued more ventures into movies. While filming The Newton Boys (1998), he wrote what many consider his most personal album, \"A Long Way Home.\" All the tracks were written solely by Dwight. He began 1999 with a Grammy win for his contribution to the track \"Same Old Train\" from the various artists' album \"Tribute to Tradition.\" He then added two new items to his resume: director and screenwriter. In South of Heaven, West of Hell (2000), he not only starred, he made his directorial debut with a screenplay he authored. Dwight Yoakam continues to prove that he is able to successfully have careers in both film and music, without either profession suffering.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODQyMzE5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ3MDUwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0948267","name":"Dwight Yoakam","idIMDB":"nm0948267"},"actorId":"nm0948267","character":"Brentwood Glasscock","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charles Gunning","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0348304","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1951","placeOfBirth":" Waxahachie, Texas, USA","birthName":"Charles Douglas Gunning","bio":"Charles Gunning was born in Waxahachie, Texas.
