Inspired by Fame (USA 1980) she entered the Taipei National University of Art after finishing high school she earned tuition money during the summer by singing commercial jingles and back-up vocals. Famous actress Sylvia Chang happened to come across a striking photograph of her at the record company where Wu worked and sent it along to Johnnie To, who was casting for a new movie. That movie was, the now classic A Moment of Romance (1990), which launched Wu into stardom across Asia. Over the next few years Wu continued with her studies while appearing in few films here and there. In 1994, she was nominated for a HKFA Best Actress Award for her performance in the UFO horror film The Returning, appeared in Ang Lee's acclaimed Eat Drink Man Woman (TAIWAN 1994), and also made her debut as a singer. Though blessed with a serene face and slender frame she has effectively been cast against type as cold-blooded killers in the Milkyway films Beyond Hypothermia (1996) and Intruder (1997). Her most acclaimed role to date is that of an ill-fated but determined young woman in Ann Hui's Eighteen Springs (1997), for which she garnered a HKFA Best Actress nomination and took home the Hong Kong Critics Society Best Actress Award. She most recently took on the role of tragic 30s actress Ruan Ling-Yu in a Mainland TV series. Since 1998 Wu has worked in China, Singapore, and even in Korea, where many people still remember her fondly from A Moment of Romance. In general, Wu has managed to keep a low profile and has avoided the usual celebrity relationship gossip for much of her career. Wu has reportedly insisted that she has no intentions of retiring from acting when or if she gets married.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA2MWQ2NTctNjMxNC00OWZmLTgzZTUtNmY4ODVhMDI3Y2FlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg0MTI5NzQ@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943072","name":"Chien-Lien Wu","idIMDB":"nm0943072"},"actorId":"nm0943072","character":"Gu Manzhen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anita Mui","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611315","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcyNzQ3ODg3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI1NTUyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 October 1963","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong, Hong Kong","birthName":"Mei Yan Fang","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"With a career that began in her early childhood, Anita Mui is the queen of Hong Kong's pop-music industry. After she won a singing contest in 1982, her life in the limelight began. In the early stages of her career her image was a little bit tomboy-ish and sexy (which was the reason she was called the \"Madonna of Hong Kong\"), and some of her songs were considered too risqué, with one of them, \"Bad Girl\", actually being banned from airplay due to its suggestive content. She started her acting career at about the same time, often starring with Anthony Chan, including Why, Why, Tell Me Why! (1986) and Yi qi liang fu (1988). Other acting partners included Jackie Chan and Leslie Cheung. Both her singing and acting careers were a success. She won an enormous number of \"Best Female Singer\" and \"Most Popular Female Singer\" awards in the 1980s, and her acting career's climax was winning \"Best Actress\" awards (Golden Horse Award and the inaugural Golden Dragon Awards in Taiwan, Hong Kong Film Award, and the Pan-Asia Pacific Film Festival) in 1987 for Stanley Kwan's \"Rouge\" Rouge (1987). In the early 1990s she announced her \"half\" retirement from the singing industry. However, by popular demand, she continued to record albums and to act in movies, and by 1994, she engineered a full comeback to great critical and popular acclaim. She passed away from cervical cancer on December 30th, 2003. Many of her friends were with her in her last hours.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcyNzQ3ODg3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI1NTUyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611315","name":"Anita Mui","nicknames":["Madonna of Asia"],"idIMDB":"nm0611315"},"actorId":"nm0611315","character":"Gu Manlu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"You Ge","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311212","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MjQ0NjAzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI2ODM4MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 April 1957","placeOfBirth":" Beijing, China","bio":"You Ge was born on April 19, 1957 in Beijing, China.
