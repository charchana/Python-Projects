The fifth of seven children, he was born in the first minute of 1891. He was a boisterous child, and at nine was tried and acquitted for attempted murder in the shooting of a motorman who had run over his dog. He worked as a lumberjack and investment promoter, and briefly ran his own pest extermination business. In his late teens, he gave up the business and traveled aimlessly about country. In San Francisco, an attempt to romance a burlesque actress resulted in an offer to join her show as a performer. He spent the next dozen years touring the country in road companies, then made a smash hit on Broadway in \"Outside Looking In\". Cecil B. DeMille saw Bickford on the stage and offered him the lead in Dynamite (1929). Contracted to MGM, Bickford fought constantly with studio head Louis B. Mayer and was for a time blacklisted among the studios. He spent several years working in independent films as a freelancer, then was offered a contract at Twentieth Century Fox. Before the contract could take effect, however, Bickford was mauled by a lion while filming 'East of Java (1935)'. He recovered, but lost the Fox contract and his leading man status due to the extensive scarring of his neck and also to increasing age. He continued as a character actor, establishing himself as a character star in films like The Song of Bernadette (1943), for which he received the first of three Oscar nominations. Burly and brusque, he played heavies and father figures with equal skill. He continued to act in generally prestigious films up until his death in 1967.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MDUxMjkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwNTYyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001948","name":"Charles Bickford","nicknames":["Charlie"],"idIMDB":"nm0001948"},"actorId":"nm0001948","character":"Brian Murphy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Helen Chandler","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151377","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGNlMjcwNGUtZmFmZi00Yjc3LWFkNzgtM2UyYmJjNDMyNmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 February 1909","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Helen Louise Chandler","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Helen Chandler was born in Charleston, South Carolina on February 1, 1906. By the late 1920s she had become a hugely popular actress on the New York stage. That Hollywood should beckon was inevitable, but unfortunately whatever quality made Chandler a success on the stage did not survive the transition to film. Chandler is probably best remembered by movie fans as the fragile Mina, pursued and nearly vampirized by Bela Lugosi in the original \"Dracula\" (1931). In 1937 Chandler left Hollywood to return to the stage, but a dependency on alcohol and sleeping pills haunted her subsequent career, and in 1940 she was committed to a sanitarium. Ten years later she was disfigured in a fire, apparenty caused by smoking in bed. Helen Chandler died (following surgery for a bleeding ulcer) on April 30, 1965. Her body was cremated, and as no relative ever came forward to claim the remains, her ashes now repose in the vaultage section (off limits to visitors) of the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGNlMjcwNGUtZmFmZi00Yjc3LWFkNzgtM2UyYmJjNDMyNmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151377","name":"Helen Chandler","idIMDB":"nm0151377"},"actorId":"nm0151377","character":"Jeanie Gregg","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mayo Methot","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0582551","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzQ4NTgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA5MjQ2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 March 1904","placeOfBirth":" Portland, Oregon, USA","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"Mayo Methot was born on March 3, 1904 in Portland, Oregon, USA.

For over two decades George Meeker fit the bill as the guy you loved to hate in movies. Frequently the spineless third wheel of a romantic triangle, he always lost the woman in the deal. In politics or business, he was the crooked lawyer or shady exec who'd sell his own mother for a quick buck. He specialized in crime mysteries and was invariably the guilty party or the victim who deserved it anyway. Meeker was born in Brooklyn on March 5, 1904 and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Art following high school. After some stage experience he made his Broadway debut with \"Judy Drops In\" in 1924 and went on to appear in a handful of plays including \"A Lady's Virtue\" (1925), \"Back Here\" (1928) and \"Conflict\" (1929). From then on he focused on films. He started his career auspiciously as silent pictures were just about to become a part of Hollywood history. A strong featured part in John Ford's Four Sons (1928) led to his top-billed role in the mystery Thief in the Dark (1928) and co-star duty opposite both Nancy Carroll in the comedy Chicken a La King (1928) and western star Rex Bell in Girl-Shy Cowboy (1928). Meeker's voice was found quite suitable for talkies and he forged ahead in roles that grew more unappetizing with time. Often bespectacled and dressed to the nines, he played the fusty, wimpy, sour-looking fiancé who loses lovely Sidney Fox in Preston Sturges' comedy-drama Strictly Dishonorable (1931), a role he would play time and again. He went on to lose Joan Blondell in The Famous Ferguson Case (1932) Irene Dunne in the classic Back Street (1932) and Margaret Sullavan in Only Yesterday (1933), among other ladies. He showed more of his corrupt side in the pre-Code Merry-Go-Round (1932) and just how homicidal his tendencies could be in the thriller Night of Terror (1933) in which he manages to out-evil Bela Lugosi. His slick looks were nudgingly unpleasant and just this side of good-looking--ideal for \"B\" mysteries. He was on the losing end in plenty of crimers, including King for a Night (1933) with Chester Morris, The Dragon Murder Case (1934) and Murder on a Honeymoon (1935). When he did appear in an \"A\" picture, he was often uncredited as in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Stella Dallas (1937), Gone with the Wind (1939), Casablanca (1942) and The Ox-Bow Incident (1943). By the 1940s and WWII, Meeker started appearing further down the credits list playing everything from featured roles to one-liners. Still up to his debonair bad guy antics, he played everything from Nazi spies in Spy Ship (1942) and Secret Enemies (1942) to slick-haired gangsters in Mr. Muggs Rides Again (1945), Crime, Inc. (1945) and Below the Deadline (1946). He also served up some shady suspects in cliffhangers with Brenda Starr, Reporter (1945) and Superman (1948) topping the list. Meeker retired from movie-making in 1951 and wasn't heard of much until his death from complications of Alzheimer's disease on August 19, 1984 in Carpenteria, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5N2UwMjYtNGJjZS00MzQ3LThjN2YtNjkzZGRhMDI2MTgwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0576120","name":"George Meeker","idIMDB":"nm0576120"},"actorId":"nm0576120","character":"Val French","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Arthur Hoyt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398446","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 March 1873","placeOfBirth":" Georgetown, Colorado, USA","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Extremely prolific actor/director of the silent screen, on Broadway from 1905. Hoyt joined the acting fraternity through the recommendations of an uncle, who worked as dramatic editor for a Cleveland tabloid. Signed by theatrical producer George C. Tyler (1868-1946), he began on stage (earning $10 per week), playing up to ten different parts. He made his Hollywood debut in 1916 with Universal. Short, balding and usually bespectacled, he managed to forge a 30-year career by playing a succession of 'little men', be they mild-mannered professors, henpecked husbands or easily intimidated minor officials. Looking perpetually befuddled was Hoyt's stock-in-trade. He was particularly effective as Professor Summerlee in The Lost World (1925) (directed by his younger brother Harry O. Hoyt), as the confused motel owner of It Happened One Night (1934) and as Mayor Tillinghast in The Great McGinty (1940). The better part of Hoyt's screen career, however, consisted of uncredited bits. For his last seven years in the business (1940-47), he was regularly employed as a member of Preston Sturges personal entourage of stock players at Paramount.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398446","name":"Arthur Hoyt","idIMDB":"nm0398446"},"actorId":"nm0398446","character":"Albert Kerr aka Mr. Tidy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Raymond Hatton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369058","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzZjODYwYTktNjVkMC00MmJiLTk5ZmEtNjg5MzNiOWZlZmQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 July 1887","placeOfBirth":" Red Oak, Iowa, USA","birthName":"Raymond William Hatton","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"The son of a physician, Raymond Hatton entered films in 1909, eventually appearing in almost 500 other pictures.
