He cares for a brother who's paraplegic, and he has a girlfriend, Sally, who wants out of the relationship. His idea of life is to go to the occasional audition, dodge his landlord (having spent the rent money Sally gave him), give Sally a hang-dog look, and talk with Pearce, who lives upstairs. Mark's flat is in disrepair: the kitchen window slams shut, bits of plaster fall from the ceiling, a bulb fizzes, and the sitting-room chandelier sways. When an awful accident happens, Mark freezes, which precipitates additional accidents; he finally calls Pearce, perhaps the worst decision possible. Will Mark come to his senses?","simplePlot":"A broke, jobless actor and a broke, jobless screenwriter set out to make a movie and then find that life starts imitating art.","actors":[{"actorName":"Dylan Moran","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0602836","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMjM2Mjk1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTIwMzE3._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1971","placeOfBirth":" Navan, Co. Meath, Ireland","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Irish comedian Dylan Moran was born in Navan, County Meath in 1971. Leaving school without any qualifications at age 16, Moran quickly became attracted to stand-up comedy and debuted, in 1992, at a comedy club in Dublin, The Comedy Cellar. A year later, he won the Channel Four comedy newcomer's \"So You Think You're Funny\" award at the Edinburgh Festival, and began developing his comedy routines into a one-man show, \"Gurgling for Money\", for which he won the prestigious Perrier Comedy Award in 1996, and which he subsequently took to a nationwide tour of the UK. His exposure at the Edinburgh Festival also led to him getting programmed at international stand-up comedy festivals, worldwide. Subsequently, Moran took to writing and performing for British television. He has starred in the BBC sitcom, How Do You Want Me? (1998), and - more importantly - in 2000, he was commissioned by Channel Four for the sitcom, Black Books (2000). He wrote and starred in three 6-episode series of this comedy. Co-starring popular British stand-up comedian Bill Bailey, who was nominated for the Perrier Award the year Moran won, Black Books (2000) sees Moran play a character close to his stand-up comedy persona: an unsociable misanthrope, reminiscent of the John Cleese sitcom character, \"Basil Fawlty\", that shares a great love of wine with one of razor-sharp put-downs of all things human. Also, his character Bernard Black's often surreal views on everyday things and on human behavior is close to his stand-up persona's dealing with them. The same year the first series of \"Black Books\" aired, Moran took his one-man show, \"Ready, Steady, Cough\", on a UK tour, followed two years later by Dylan Moran: Monster (2004). This was followed by Monster II in 2004. In the late 1990's, Moran also moved from doing stand-up to working on a film acting CV. He played opposite Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in Notting Hill (1999), co-starred with Michael Caine in The Actors (2003) and had parts in the Simon Pegg comedy, Shaun of the Dead (2004) and the Michael Winterbottom film, Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story (2005). Moran's live stand-up comedy is unique in that it merges two strands of stand-up that seemed incompatible for a long time: sharp observational humor, and surreal and fantastical language-based absurdity. On the one hand, he has a clear influence from what could be called an American school of stand-up comedy that is heavily observational. On the other hand, Moran's comedy is characterized by a use of language similar to the stand-up comedy of Eddie Izzard and Ross Noble: surreal associative leaps between on the one side observations and on the other fantasies, verbally painting bizarre and absurd worlds, often through a use of stream-of-consciousness narration. His language is often highly poetic, resembling a James Joyce that has had one too many. Moran is very reluctant to give interviews on his personal life and even on his career, a fact parodied in a staged interview inter-cut with the recording of his live stand-up show, \"Monster\", on its DVD release.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMjM2Mjk1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTIwMzE3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0602836","name":"Dylan Moran","idIMDB":"nm0602836"},"actorId":"nm0602836","character":"Pierce","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mark Doherty","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1019747","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDQ1MDg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE1MDIwMjE@._V1_UY44_CR23,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Mark Doherty is an actor and writer, known for A Film with Me in It (2008), Fear of Flying (2012) and Ondine (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDQ1MDg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE1MDIwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1019747","name":"Mark Doherty","idIMDB":"nm1019747"},"actorId":"nm1019747","character":"Mark","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0172470","main":true},{"actorName":"Keith Allen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0020717","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEyNjc2MjE5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1MDk5Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 September 1953","placeOfBirth":" Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK","birthName":"Keith Howell Charles Allen","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Keith Allen was born on September 2, 1953 in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, Wales as Keith Howell Charles Allen.

O'Conor was still a relative unknown pre-teen when he co-starred with Liam Neeson in the British-made feature Lamb (1985), playing the ten-year-old Owen, a lonely epileptic boy who is temporarily rescued from a violent and oppressive children's home by Brother Sebastian (Neeson). It was three years before the actor landed another major film role, that of the youthful version of Martin Sheen's narrator (seen in flashbacks) in the 1988 film adaptation of Hugh Leonard's heartwarming Tony-winning play \"Da\". His next film was the Daniel Day Lewis tour de force My Left Foot (1989). Directed by Jim Sheridan, the film told the story of the severely handicapped writer Christy Brown. Once again, O'Conor played the lead as a child, but this was a much more demanding and widely-seen performance. Much lighter in tone was the big-budget remake of _The Three Musketeers (1993)_, in which O'Conor played the Boy King Louis, who is protected from assassination by the title characters. O'Conor's first starring role came with Ben Ross' dark British comedy The Young Poisoner's Handbook (1995), in which he was an amateur toxicologist unwisely paroled from prison after testing his theories on family and friends, with fatal results. Based on a true story, it was a thoroughly unpleasant bit of work, yet found an appreciative audience. The following year, O'Conor played a teen trying to form a rock band in 1959 Russia in Red Hot (1993).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMDA3MTY1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0ODAxNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640560","name":"Hugh O'Conor","idIMDB":"nm0640560"},"actorId":"nm0640560","character":"Detective","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Rhys Meyers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001667","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgxODcwMzE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4MjMzNg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 July 1977","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","birthName":"Jonathan Michael Francis O'Keefe","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Jonathan Rhys Meyers was born Jonathan Michael Francis O'Keefe on July 27, 1977, in Dublin, Ireland, to Mary Geraldine (Meyers) and John O'Keeffe, a musician. He and his family moved to County Cork, Ireland, when the actor was nearly a year old, and then, at the age of 3, his father left the family, leaving his mother to care for Jonny and his 3 younger brothers alone. Rhys Meyers grew up with a tumultuous childhood, spending some time in an orphanage and being permanently expelled from school at age 16. Happy to be out of school, he began spending time in a local pool hall where he was discovered by Hubbard Casting. The casting agents were talent-spotting for the David Puttnam production of War of the Buttons (1994), and asked Rhys Meyers to appear for an audition. After three days of auditions, however, he did not get the role, and Rhys Meyers gave up on his acting aspirations. Soon afterward, he received a call to audition for a national ad campaign for Knorr soup, and though embarrassed by the attention from the ad, he soon found himself considered for a major film. His movie acting debut was a very small role in the film A Man of No Importance (1994), where his simple cast credit is as \"First Young Man\". His first lead role was in the film The Disappearance of Finbar (1996). During a 6-month postponement in production, he returned home to Cork and there received a call about the film Michael Collins (1996). He traveled to Dublin to meet with director Neil Jordan and successfully won the role of Collins's assassin. Jordan wrote about his meeting with the actor, \"I have found someone to play Collin's (sic) killer. Jonathan Rees-Myers (sic), from County Cork, apparently, who looks like a young Tom Cruise. [He] Comes into the casting session with alarming certainty. Obviously gifted\". Rhys Meyers continued working constantly from that point and appeared in such films as The Maker (1997), Telling Lies in America (1997), and The Tribe (1998). Going on to film The Governess (1998), B. Monkey (1998), Titus (1999) and Ride with the Devil (1999), he has received critical acclaim for several performances, most notably as \"Brian Slade\" in Velvet Goldmine (1998), as \"Steerpike\" in the British mini-series Gormenghast (2000), and as a sympathetic football coach in Bend It Like Beckham (2002). Rhys Meyers is also a talented singer and musician, having performed his own vocals in Velvet Goldmine (1998) and appearing on the film's soundtrack. Rhys Meyers still resides in County Cork, Ireland.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgxODcwMzE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4MjMzNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001667","name":"Jonathan Rhys
