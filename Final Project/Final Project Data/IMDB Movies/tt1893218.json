Reared in a household which he describes as \"half-British, half-American, all-Canadian\", David's family cherished the arts and international travel. When they relocated to the \"big city\" of Calgary, David, 15 at the time, took his first paying entertainment job as a singer and dancer, bringing to the forefront all of the natural talent that he had accumulated from his diverse upbringing. David was admitted to the prestigious McGill University and began to pursue a degree in architecture while simultaneously taking electives within the arts, including literature and theater. His penchant for Sketch Comedy drew him to the local clubs where he regularly performed. All the while he was acting in plays from Shakespeare, Moliere and Gilbert and Sullivan. When David graduated with his BS.Architecture degree, an economic recession put a wrinkle in his aspirations to practice design. Instead, David and a friend formed a comedy duo, and together they ventured to Toronto. It was during performances at the world-renowned Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal that David was \"discovered\". What began as a 3-year experiment garnered him an invitation from Hollywood. Following his freshman appearances on such American TV shows as 'Melrose Place' and 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', David soon made LA his permanent residence, and in recent times, his working actor status has begun its crescendo to new heights. As one of Hallmark's favorite leading men, he has portrayed the romantic heartthrob in three well-received films with that network. When cast as \"the other guy\" in 'Bridal Wave', he had the thrilling opportunity to meet privately with the legendary producer Walter Mirisch at his Universal Studios office. In his most recent Hallmark film, 'My Christmas Dream', he played opposite one of Hallmark's favorite leading ladies, Danica McKellar. David's ability to play the \"everyday man\" as well as the leading man, (opposite such talented costars as Taraji P. Henson and Amy Acker to name a few) has earned him growing comparisons to golden Hollywood screen star, Cary Grant. Currently, David is being featured as Mr. Ketch on the CW's acclaimed series, 'Supernatural'. As a James Bond-like, suave monster hunter who also happens to be a sociopath, David has enjoyed delving into a role unlike anything he has ever played, but still retaining his customary charm and passionate attention to detail. He also appreciates the sincere, underlying messages of the show's culture which fosters a sense of family and charitable work within the local and international fan-base. Throughout the genesis of David's career, he would best be described as \"hidden in plain sight.\" Now, as an actor on the cusp, it is very clear when talking to David that he has chosen to stick to those values that he learned from Kyle, the small town from whence he came.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4ODg0Njc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcyNzg5ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427869","name":"David Haydn-Jones","idIMDB":"nm0427869"},"actorId":"nm0427869","character":"Derek Gowen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Emma Duke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4420609","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUyZmNhNzQtMWE1MC00ZDU2LWExY2UtMzEwZDk1ZWQ0MTI3L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1ODc2MzU@._V1_UY44_CR12,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Emma Duke is an actress, known for Le plus beau des cadeaux (2011), Beyond the Sun (2017) and Lalaloopsy (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUyZmNhNzQtMWE1MC00ZDU2LWExY2UtMzEwZDk1ZWQ0MTI3L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1ODc2MzU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4420609","name":"Emma Duke","idIMDB":"nm4420609"},"actorId":"nm4420609","character":"Olivia Gowen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Creery","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0187267","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNzYwOTA2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQyMTUxOTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Patrick got the acting bug when he took an elective course in Drama during his first year at Queen's University.

She has been at home on center stage ever since. As a precocious and outgoing child Gina performed in all her school plays and talent shows. Through most of these early years, as she moved around with her mom and older brother, her first love was dance. Whether ballet, tap, modern, or musical theatre, Gina was immersed in dance performance. As the classical ballet training developed her unrelenting work ethic, it wasn't long before Gina's love of performance began to shape itself into something resembling a career. At the age of fifteen, Gina was scouted by a modeling agency and shipped to Japan. Embracing the move with both hands, Gina schooled herself on the culture and language and the country quickly became her second home. Professionally, Japan was a major break. Gina was unbelievably successful in modeling and appeared on upwards of twenty magazine covers. But modeling was never Gina's passion. While her talent and drive gave her a taste of success, modeling was ultimately a stepping stone to bigger things, in another medium. On returning to North America, Gina went back to school, where she continued to study Japanese and graduated from college at the top of her class. Then, while working two jobs, Gina took acting classes to develop her stage skills. It was during these years that she faced a lot of naysayers, a lot of people telling her, \"No, you can't.\" In spite of - or perhaps because of - this type of pessimism, Gina was determined to become an actor. \"Oh really? Just watch me!\" was her response. Continuously driven and fiercely independent, Gina has managed to achieve big things without buying into the trappings of show business. In a world that revolves around money, fame, and image, Gina has found success and happiness through sheer will and commitment to her craft. She also finds fulfillment volunteering with less fortunate people - Gina has worked with physically and mentally challenged and enjoys supporting bullied teen girls, helping them foster confidence and self esteem. Despite a list of personal achievements that includes starring roles in prime time TV shows and in feature films (big budget and indie), Gina continues to work hard to achieve bigger and better things. She continues to study theatre and classical ballet, and, surrounded by loving friends and family, she is always looking ahead. And up!","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3Njk1NjI2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjgxMTky._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1248373","name":"Gina Holden","nicknames":["G"],"idIMDB":"nm1248373"},"actorId":"nm1248373","character":"Jillian","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Dugan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0240807","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Dugan is an actor, known for The Ron Clark Story (2006), Le plus beau des cadeaux (2011) and Montana Sky (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0240807","name":"James Dugan","idIMDB":"nm0240807"},"actorId":"nm0240807","character":"Frank McCourt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Margherita Donato","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1966324","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Margherita Donato is known for her work on The Right Kind of Wrong (2013), Innocence à vendre (2005) and Le plus beau des cadeaux (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1966324","name":"Margherita Donato","idIMDB":"nm1966324"},"actorId":"nm1966324","character":"Kim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brooklynn Proulx","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1628077","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDE3NDk0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgzMDIzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 April 1999","placeOfBirth":" Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada","birthName":"Brooklynn Marie Proulx","height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Brooklynn Proulx was born on April 27, 1999 in Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada as Brooklynn Marie Proulx.
