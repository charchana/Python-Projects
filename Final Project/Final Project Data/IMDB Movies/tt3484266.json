The beautician sets forth to find the treasure, but all the belongings of the mansion have been confiscated and auctioned. The beautician seeks help by the neighbor's's shop, a tattoo studio, where the broke owner does everything he can to help, and discovers that there are eight identical chairs and that there is a way to find their owners.
