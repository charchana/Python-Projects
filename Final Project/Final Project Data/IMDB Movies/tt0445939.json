Brown III","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"A tall, wavy-haired US actor with a deep, resonant voice, Clancy Brown has proved himself a versatile performer with first-class contributions to theater, feature films, television series and even animation. Clarence J. Brown III was born in 1959 in Urbana, Ohio, to Joyce Helen (Eldridge), a concert pianist, conductor, and composer, and Republican congressman Clarence J. \"Bud\" Brown, Jr., who helped manage the Brown Publishing Company, the family-owned newspaper started by Clancy's grandfather, Congressman Clarence J. Brown. Clancy spent much of his youth in close proximity to Washington, D.C. He plied his dramatic talents in the Chicago theater scene before moving onto feature film with a sinister debut performance bullying Sean Penn inside a youth reformatory in Bad Boys (1983). He portrayed Viktor the Monster in the unusual spin on the classic Frankenstein story in The Bride (1985), before scoring one of his best roles to date as the evil Kurgan hunting fellow immortals Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery across four centuries of time in Highlander (1986). Brown played a corrupt American soldier in the Walter Hill-directed hyper-violent action film Extreme Prejudice (1987), another deranged killer in Shoot to Kill (1988) and a brutal prison guard, who eventually somewhat \"befriends\" wrongfully convicted banker Tim Robbins, in the moving The Shawshank Redemption (1994). His superb vocal talents were in demand, and he contributed voices to animated series, including Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1995), Street Sharks (1994), Gargoyles (1994) and Superman (1996). Brown then landed two more plum roles, one as a \"tough-as-nails\" drill sergeant in the science fiction thriller Starship Troopers (1997), and the other alongside Robin Williams in the Disney comedy Flubber (1997). The video gaming industry took notice of Clancy's vocal abilities, too, and he has contributed voices to several top selling video games, including Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex (2001), Lands of Lore III (1999), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002) and Crash Nitro Kart (2003). His voice is also the character of cranky crustacean Mr. Eugene H. Krabs in the highly successful SpongeBob SquarePants (1999) animated series and films, and he contributed voices to The Batman (2004), Jackie Chan Adventures (2000) and Justice League (2001) animated series. A popular and friendly personality, Clancy Brown continues to remain busy both through his vocal and acting talents in Hollywood.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxODY3NjAzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ5MjYwNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000317","name":"Clancy Brown","idIMDB":"nm0000317"},"actorId":"nm0000317","character":"John Clay","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0130709","main":true},{"actorName":"David Busse","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2720792","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MjM2MzU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMxNjIzNg@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"David Busse is known for his work on Captain Fantastic (2016), The Burrowers (2008) and Outlaws and Angels (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MjM2MzU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMxNjIzNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2720792","name":"David Busse","idIMDB":"nm2720792"},"actorId":"nm2720792","character":"Young Bluecoat","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0217295","main":true},{"actorName":"William Mapother","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0544611","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNzkyMTgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI1MTkzNQ@@._V1_UY44_CR11,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 April 1965","placeOfBirth":" Louisville, Kentucky, USA","birthName":"William Reibert Mapother Jr.","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"William Mapother was born on April 17, 1965 in Louisville, Kentucky, USA as William Reibert Mapother Jr. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a B.A. in English.

After the show, she was asked if she would like to meet the Cat in the Hat. She thought about it and replied, \"No, I want to be the Cat in the Hat. How do you get up there?\" After a couple of years on the local Albuquerque theatre circuit, Brighid landed an international modeling job with LaCoste. From there, she began picking up small parts in films that were shooting in NM. Finally, in 2007 she made her way out to LA. On a flight home to Albuquerque to film \"The Burrowers\", she met a couple of directors, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. She landed the supporting role of Delia in their film, \"Gamer\", which starred Gerard Butler. She has since been working away in LA doing small Indies, student films, and theatre, as well as appearances on television and an occasional feature film. A couple of national commercials and a music video or two have also come her way. She won a maverick award for her role in \"Sugar Rush\", a USC film. She has also been nominated for festival awards for her work in \"After the Shearing\" (a UCLA Grad film for AARP). She won Best Actress for the short A.B.S at the Women's Independent Film Festival. She was nominated for a Young Artist Award for her part in \"Criminal Minds.\" Deborah Dozier Potter, a former member of the Kennedy Center's President's Advisory Council for the Arts and the daughter of Joan Fontaine and niece of Olivia de Havilland, called Brighid's performance in the NM produced film \"Hearts of Desire\" extraordinary, remarking that she believed Brighid was destined for greatness. The LA Times said her performance in Woyzeck for the Gangbusters Theatre Company had disarming command. In 2011, Brighid wrote and directed her own short film, A.B.S. A.B.S is on the festival circuit where it has already won awards of distinction, including best short film, in several festivals. She has also picked up awards for directing and cinematography for A.B.S. Her dream is to get her production company, Phish Tank Philms, up and running and to turn A.B.S into a web series.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmZmZDNkNWQtOTlkYy00ODFhLTg0ZTgtMmIxYWI4MzFiNDMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE2Mzg2ODI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2459787","name":"Brighid Fleming","idIMDB":"nm2459787"},"actorId":"nm2459787","character":"Little Sister","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0217299","main":true},{"actorName":"Karl Geary","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311297","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzODgwMTg5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjI3Mzgy._V1_UY44_CR5,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 May 1972","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","birthName":"Karl John Geary","bio":"Karl Geary was born on May 31, 1972 in Dublin, Ireland as Karl John Geary.
