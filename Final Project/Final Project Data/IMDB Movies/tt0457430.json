She graduated High School at The American School of Barcelona in 2012. She got her big break in 2006 when Guillermo Del Toro cast her as the lead in his critically acclaimed fantasy thriller \"Pan's Labyrinth.\" The role of Ofelia was originally intended for an eight-year-old girl, but the script was altered to accommodate Ivana (who was eleven at the time) due to her outstanding audition. Ivana was awarded the 2007 Goya Award for Best New Actress for her performance in \"Pan's Labyrinth.\" In addition to her Goya Award, she received various awards including the Award for Best Newcomer by the Union of Spanish Actors, the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor and the Imagen Award for Best Actress. Before receiving great acclaim in \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" Ivana had already appeared in a number of films. The most notable of these films were \"Fragile\" with Calista Flockhart and \"Romasanta\" alongside Julian Sands, both of which were supporting roles when she was only 9 and 10 years old. Ivana played her first American role in the feature film \"The New Daughter,\" where she starred opposite Kevin Costner. In 2015, she shot in New Zealand MTV's television series \"The Shannara Chronicles\"- a story based on Terry Brook's bestselling novel \"The Elfstones of Shannara.\" While she is fully dedicated to her acting carrier, she is also undertaking Law studies.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwNTY4ODQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc0MDkyNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1419440","name":"Ivana Baquero","idIMDB":"nm1419440"},"actorId":"nm1419440","character":"Ofelia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004503","main":true},{"actorName":"Sergi López","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0530365","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMDc3NzE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQwODc1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 December 1965","placeOfBirth":" Vilanova i la Geltrú, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","birthName":"Sergi López i Ayats","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Sergi López is a Catalan actor, whose specialty is villains of all types but whose range also includes dramatizing romantic and comedic roles with equal mastery. He was born outside of Barcelona in the seaside town of Villanova i la Geltrú on December 22nd, 1965. As a youth he was inclined towards the performance arts and headed to France for further studies in the field. In 1991 he auditioned for French director Manuel Poirier who was so impressed with Sergi that he gave him the lead role in \"Western.\" Poirier and López continued to collaborate on \"La Petite-Amie d'Antonio,\" \"La Campagne,\" \"Attention Fragile,\" and \"Marion\" in subsequent years. Sergi often played the charming Spanish immigrant lost in France in Poirier's films. Sergi's career was actually cemented in France that catapulted him to public recognition, while Spain was still relatively oblivious to her talented son until 1997. In 1997 Sergi appeared in Catalan auteur Ventura Pons' \"Caricies\" that also showcased Spain's finest actors. He spoke Catalan in the role. After \"Caricies\" Sergi appeared in Spanish cinema more frequently such as in \"Entre las piernas\" with Spanish mega-stars Javier Bardem and Victoria Abril and in \"Lisboa\" with Spanish legend Carmen Maura. Sergi was then offered plum roles both in France and Spain and split time traveling back and forth between his adopted nation and native motherland. In 2001 he won the César for his role in Dominick Moll's \"Harry, Un Ami Qui Vous Veut du Bien.\" This role came to define his mastery on villainous roles which continued in \"Solo Mia\" with Paz Vega as his battered wife, Stephen Frears' \"Dirty Pretty Things\" with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou as his scared pawns, and Guillermo del Toro's \"El Laberinto del Fauno\" with post-Civil Spain as playground for his Vidal's sadism. However, not all is dark villainy in Sergi's most recognized and praised thespian filmography. Sergi also displayed his comedic talents in \"Hombre Felices\" and \"Janis et John.\" With such range, talent, and skill, it is no wonder horror master and aficionado Guillermo del Toro said he is \"in love\" with Sergi's work and insisted on casting him as the stone-cold killer Captain Vidal despite Spanish producers' misgivings. Let us hope that, despite wider international exposure, Sergi continues to retain his unique avant-gardeness and participate only in projects that do his talent justice.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMDc3NzE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjQwODc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0530365","name":"Sergi López","idIMDB":"nm0530365"},"actorId":"nm0530365","character":"Vidal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004505","main":true},{"actorName":"Maribel Verdú","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893941","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NjkwMjA0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU2NzE2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 October 1970","placeOfBirth":" Madrid, Spain","birthName":"María Isabel Verdú Rollán","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Maribel Verdú was born on October 2, 1970 in Madrid, Spain as María Isabel Verdú Rollán.

Grew up studying singing, dancing and the violin. She even appeared occasionally singing with her two brothers in their banda named \"Matamala\". At 17, she appeared on the cover of an avant-garde Catalonian magazine and from there she began working in local theatre companies and on local Catalonian TV channels, including giving Catalan language classes on Canal 33. It was here where she caught the eye of Bigas Luna, which led to Lola (1986), her first film and, thus, her future was set. It was in 1991 that she became well-known in the film Amo tu cama rica (1992), a comedy with Javier Bardem, consolidated a year later in Fernando Trueba's romantic comedy Belle Epoque (1992), starring Penélope Cruz. However, her better and more serious roles appeared from the mid-nineties onwards, and she showed she was able to take on the most difficult parts, most notably in Malena es un nombre de tango (1996) and Black Tears (1998). She also had time to do a few theatre productions in Catalonia, such as Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\", among other plays. She has a daughter, Violeta Rodríguez, named after her character in Belle Epoque (1992), born from her romance with the director David Trueba. She is extremely interested in working in Iberamerican cinema and has already worked in Argentina. To date, she has shown she is an extremely versatile actress, such that she is known here in Spain as the actress for \"impossible roles\". Much now depends on whether she can be offered the right parts so that she can continue to develop as a serious character actress.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxODMxNjU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTM1NjA0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0317725","name":"Ariadna Gil","idIMDB":"nm0317725"},"actorId":"nm0317725","character":"Carmen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0455639","main":true},{"actorName":"Álex Angulo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0029962","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhMDhkMGUtMjg5MC00MDNhLWJjODMtOGY3MmUzMWQ3NTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR23,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1953","placeOfBirth":" Erandio, Vizcaya, País Vasco, Spain","birthName":"Alejandro Angulo León","bio":"Álex Angulo was born on April 12, 1953 in Erandio, Vizcaya, País Vasco, Spain as Alejandro Angulo León.
