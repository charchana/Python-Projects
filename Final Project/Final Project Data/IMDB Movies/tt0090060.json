He is the eldest son of actor Martin Sheen, who at the time was just breaking into the business. His mother, Janet Sheen (née Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Emilio's father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Charlie Sheen, Renée Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry. He lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side until his family relocated to Malibu in 1968. Before graduating from Santa Monica High School in 1980, Estevez had already had a small role as a messenger boy in Apocalypse Now (1979), that was ultimately cut from the film. Though his father had opted to use the stage name \"Sheen\" over his more ethnic birth name \"Estevez,\" Emilio chose to retain the family name, hoping to avoid riding his father's coattails. He also thought the double \"E\" set of initials was \"pretty.\" He appeared in a few TV movies, the first of which was Seventeen Going on Nowhere (1980), before making his big-screen debut opposite Matt Dillon in 1982's Tex (1982). A part in The Outsiders (1983) followed, and Estevez made his first big splash as the punk rocker Otto in the cult classic Repo Man (1984). Originally cast as Bender (The Criminal) in the seminal John Hughes flick The Breakfast Club (1985), Estevez took the part of Andrew (The Athlete) instead after Hughes could find no one else to fill the role. Another ensemble film, St. Elmo's Fire (1985) came next. Then Estevez made his screen-writing debut with That Was Then... This Is Now (1985), a film in which he also starred. He then starred in the Stephen King thriller Maximum Overdrive (1986), but the film was a failure. The ambitious young actor added directing to his palette with Wisdom (1987) in 1986, but the film was universally panned and struck out at the box office. Estevez quickly rebounded with hits like Stakeout (1987) and Young Guns (1988), as well as their subsequent sequels. He tried his hand at directing again with Men at Work (1990) before taking on one of his most famous roles as Coach Gordon Bombay in The Mighty Ducks (1992). The enormously popular Disney film spawned sequels and an NHL hockey team of the same name, but Estevez was interested in making weighter films. He agreed to make a brief appearance in D3: The Mighty Ducks (1996) in exchange for Disney helping him finance and distribute another effort as actor-director, The War at Home (1996). Though smiled on by critics, The War at Home (1996) received a paltry distribution by Disney and thus went largely unseen. A devastated Estevez considered quitting the business but has ultimately continued to work in films, including a fourth effort as director and star, Rated X (2000), which co-starred brother Charlie Sheen and was a selection at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2006, Bobby (2006), a film about the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy that Estevez wrote, directed, and acted in, premiered at the Venice Film Festival and received a seven-minute standing ovation.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY2MDM3MDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQxOTkyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000389","name":"Emilio Estevez","idIMDB":"nm0000389"},"actorId":"nm0000389","character":"Kirby Keger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017630","main":true},{"actorName":"Rob Lowe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000507","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY2NjYxMDY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3MTMwNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 March 1964","placeOfBirth":" Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","birthName":"Robert Hepler Lowe","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Rob Lowe was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, to Barbara Lynn (Hepler), a schoolteacher, and Charles Davis Lowe, a lawyer.

Her father, Charles Foster Harmon, Sr., left her mother, Virginia Beverly (King), before Demi was born. Her stepfather, Danny Guynes, did not add much stability to her life, either. He frequently changed jobs and made the family move a total of 40 times. The parents kept on drinking, arguing and beating, until Guynes finally committed suicide. Demi quit school at age 16 to work as a pin-up-girl. At 18, she married rock musician Freddy Moore; the marriage lasted four years. At 19, she became a regular on the soap opera General Hospital (1963) (1982-1983). From the first salaries, she started partying and sniffing cocaine. That lasted more than three years, until director Joel Schumacher threatened to fire her from the set of St. Elmo's Fire (1985) when she turned up high. She got a withdrawal treatment and returned clean within a week... and stayed clean. With determination and a skill for publicity stunts, like the nude appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair while pregnant, she made her way to fame. Thanks to the huge commercial success of Ghost (1990) and the controversial pictures Indecent Proposal (1993) and Disclosure (1994), she became Hollywood's most sought-after and most expensive actress. In 2009, Demi Moore and spouse Ashton Kutcher launched The Demi and Ashton Foundation, a non-profit, non-governmental organization directed towards fighting child sexual slavery. Its first campaign in \"Real Men Don't Buy Girls\". On April 23, 2011, Demi and Ashton appeared together for their first on-air interview on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight (2011) to promote their foundation and start the work towards ending child sexual slavery. The foundation's website enables people to educate themselves, show support and take action or make a donation.

The acting bug bit when he went to watch a friend's audition and was obliged to audition in order to stay. He won the role. After graduation, Judd headed for New York City and the Stella Adler Conservatory where he was believable in the role as the \"street-smart Eddie Keaton\" in the comedy Making the Grade (1984). Judd's next film role was as the stodgy ROTCer, Phil Hicks, in the ensemble comedy Fandango (1985). Important and diverse roles in the brat-pack films The Breakfast Club (1985) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985) quickly followed. With his privileged upbringing, Judd could have brought the right degree of preppy-smarmyness, (ala James Spader), to any number of vapid roles, but his intense stare and dark smoldering looks gave him a hint of danger which added to his credibility in films like the Billionaire Boys Club (1987), From the Hip (1987) and New Jack City (1991). While Judd's career has been peppered with under-promoted films and poorly-written TV appearances, critics have not been overly kind to this misunderstood actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3ODUwODQ5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzNzQyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000555","name":"Judd Nelson","idIMDB":"nm0000555"},"actorId":"nm0000555","character":"Alec Newbary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017633","main":true},{"actorName":"Ally Sheedy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000639","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MzY0NTU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 June 1962","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Alexandra Elizabeth Sheedy","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Ally Sheedy was born in New York City, to Charlotte (Baum), a press agent and writer, and John J. Sheedy, Jr., an advertising executive. She is of Russian Jewish (mother) and Irish (father) descent. While at New York's Bank Street School, 12-year-old Ally Sheedy wrote about a mythical encounter between Queen Elizabeth I and an inquisitive mouse. The result, \"She Was Nice to Mice\", was published by McGraw-Hill and became an instant best seller. Although it proved a springboard to an acting career, Sheedy's strongest memories of childhood remain those of \"dancing and doing plays\". From six until fourteen, she danced with the American Ballet Theatre and, during summers at Fire Island, she'd \"get a bunch of kids together and stage shows on back lawns and porches\". When she discovered that to stay with dancing meant staying with starvation diets, she shifted her focus to acting for good. Meanwhile, her book brought her requests from several publications. The Village Voice asked her to review movies and the New York Times wanted her to review children's books. The assignment she accepted was from Ms. Magazine, which requested an article about her mother and herself. It was an appearance on \"The Mike Douglas Show (1961) to promote her book, however, that brought Sheedy work as a performer. Signed by an agent who caught the show, she was sent out on television commercials, immediately. Only 15 at the time, she also performed off-Broadway and on a series of after-school specials. The day she turned 18, Sheedy packed her bags and headed for Los Angeles, where she enrolled in the drama department at USC, and soon landed roles in the television drama The Best Little Girl in the World (1981), The Day the Loving Stopped (1981), Splendor in the Grass (1981) and Homeroom (1981) and played a recurring character on Hill Street Blues (1981). The strength of her performances led directly to her film debut as Sean Penn's naive-but-knowing girlfriend, \"J.C.\", in Bad Boys (1983). That same year (1983), she starred as Matthew Broderick's zany partner in WarGames (1983). After starring as Rob Lowe's would-be romantic interest in Oxford Blues (1984), the withdrawn adolescent of The Breakfast Club (1985) and Gene Hackman's adoring daughter in Twice in a Lifetime (1985), Sheedy played her first fully-adult role in St. Elmo's Fire (1985), the 1985 hit about college friends.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MzY0NTU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000639","name":"Ally Sheedy","idIMDB":"nm0000639"},"actorId":"nm0000639","character":"Leslie Hunter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017631","main":true},{"actorName":"Mare Winningham","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001858","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0ODU1NjgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM2MTA4MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 May 1959","placeOfBirth":" Phoenix, Arizona, USA","birthName":"Mary Megan Winningham","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Mary 'Mare' Megan Winningham is an actress and songwriter who has appeared in nearly 100 TV shows and feature films.

Mare attended Chatsworth High School with Val Kilmer, James Rekart and Kevin Spacey, but she was bitten by the acting bug much earlier on.

He was the first-born child. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, and his mother was born in New York, to Russian Jewish parents. Martin caught the acting bug in high school where he participated in the drama club. After high school, he continued his interest in acting by attending Manhattan's progressive New School. When World War II broke out, Martin was called to service in his early twenties. After the war, he was lucky to secure a position as an usher at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. By 1947, he was honing his craft at the Actors Studio, run at that time by Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. His time at the Actors Studio in New York City allowed him training in the famous Stanislavsky method. Despite his excellent training, he had to prove himself, just like any up and coming young actor. He began on Broadway in the late 1940s. But, it was not until 1951 that he experienced real success. That play was Tennessee Williams' \"The Rose Tattoo\". After his Broadway success, he had a few minor television roles before his big break arrived when he joined the cast of On the Waterfront (1954). In the 1950s, Martin had many television roles. He had recurring roles on some of the most popular television series of that time, including The United States Steel Hour (1953), The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse (1948), Goodyear Playhouse (1951) and Studio One in Hollywood (1948). In 1957, he was able to prove himself on the big-screen once again, with a prominent role in 12 Angry Men (1957), directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda. All of Martin's television work in the 1950s did not go to waste. While starring on an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955), Hitchcock was so impressed by his work, that he offered him a key supporting role of Detective Milton Arbogast in Psycho (1960). His work with Hitchcock opened him up to a world of other acting opportunities. Many strong movie roles came his way in the 1960s, including parts in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Cape Fear (1962) and The Carpetbaggers (1964). One of the proudest moments in his life was when he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for A Thousand Clowns (1965). It was soon after that he began accepting roles in European movies. He soon developed a love for Italy, and lived there most of his remaining years. He acted in over a dozen Italian movies and spent his later life traveling between Hollywood and Europe for his many roles. After a career that spanned more than fifty years, Martin Balsam died of natural causes in his beloved Italy at age 76. He passed away of a heart attack at a hotel in Rome called Residenza di Repetta. He was survived by his third wife Irene Miller and three children, Adam, Zoe and Talia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwOTE4MjMxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc5MDg5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000842","name":"Martin Balsam","nicknames":["The Bronx Barrymore"],"idIMDB":"nm0000842"},"actorId":"nm0000842","character":"Mr. Beamish","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Andie MacDowell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000510","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc1NTc4Nzk2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMwMzg5Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 April 1958","placeOfBirth":" Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","birthName":"Rosalie Anderson MacDowell","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Andie MacDowell was born Rosalie Anderson MacDowell on April 21, 1958 in Gaffney, South Carolina, to Pauline Johnston (Oswald), a music teacher, and Marion St. Pierre MacDowell, a lumber executive.

Joyce was auditioning for modeling roles before reaching her first birthday, and by age eight, was appearing on radio and on Broadway in \"Love's Old Sweet Song\" by William Saroyan. One year later, she and Dick had bit roles in the film Reg'lar Fellers (1941) and appeared together in the play \"The Wind Is Ninety\" (1945). Following a relatively brief marriage to Thomas King at the age of 16 and the birth of their son Casey King a year later, Joyce grew into young adult roles and found parts in a number of popular plays including \"The Desk Set\" (1955) and \"A Hole in the Head\" (1957). She appeared with Dick in New York in \"The Male Animal\" (1953), \"The Tender Trap\" (1955), and \"Oh Men! Oh Women! (1955). Joyce downplayed her beauty for smart, cynical, earthier characters and specialized in wry comedy. Some of her other notable film appearances were in Fourteen Hours (1951), The Goddess (1958), I Love You, Alice B. Toklas! (1968), and Making It (1971), which also featured her brother Dick. Her career in television began to flourish with appearances on the TV daytime dramas As the World Turns (1956) and Young Dr. Malone (1958), The Danny Kaye Show (1963) for four seasons, The Good Guys (1968) for two seasons, and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979) for one season, in addition to countless guest appearances on other comedy and drama series such as Judging Amy (1999), Desperate Housewives (2004), and The Good Wife (2009).

And in 1981, Jenny made a brief appearance in the TV film, Rape & Marriage (1991) with Mickey Rourke. She continued to act on stage, even garnering rave reviews for her portrayal of Dorcus Fray in Joseph Papp's Broadway production of \"Plenty\". In 1982, Jenny was cast in The World According to Garp (1982), after impressing director George Roy Hill with her blend of sensuality and innocence. Jenny then arrived in London for \"Pink Floyd: The Wall\", where she played an abused groupie. She then quickly followed up with four months in Utah for the TV documentary/drama, \"The Executioner's Song,\" which proved to be a more substantial role. Jenny returned to New York afterwards, and back to the stage and took a break from films. She went back to films in 1984, for \"The Wild Life\" with Eric Stoltz and Chris Penn. Jenny also made appearances in films such as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1984) and \"Out of Bounds\" (1986). By appearing in films with actors such as Rob Loew and Anthony Michael Hall, Jenny was put in the 'Brat Pack' category. It was something she found to be uncomfortable, and wanted to shake off. Thus, Jenny's film choices became edgier, starting with Near Dark in 1987. With her girl next door look, large soulful eyes, and sensuality, Jenny made the role of sweet yet dangerous Mae her most memorable part of her career. She credits director Kathryn Bigelow with creating the film's mood and atmosphere, which makes \"Near Dark\" a stand-out film in the vampire genre. While \"Near Dark\" didn't fair too well at the box office, it did receive cult status, bringing Jenny independent,'left of center' film roles. Finally, Jenny successfully rid herself of the 'Brat Pack' label. She went on to teen roles in the critically acclaimed film The Chocolate War (1988) and in the off-beat \"Twister\" (1988). Those roles then gave way to conventional parts in the mainstream films \"Young Guns II\" (1990)and \"The Lawnmower Man\" (1992). After that, Jenny quit the film business. Her last film appearance was a small role in \"Enchanted\" (1998).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2MjA1NDUxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI3MzcxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942486","name":"Jenny Wright","idIMDB":"nm0942486"},"actorId":"nm0942486","character":"Felicia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0092855","main":true},{"actorName":"Blake Clark","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163703","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2NTc4NDcyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc2MjcyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 February 1946","placeOfBirth":" Macon, Georgia, USA","bio":"For the last 20 or so years, Clark has been doing stand-up comedy on the club circuit, on \"The Tonight Show\", on HBO comedy specials, on Late Night with David Letterman (1982) and Late Night with Conan O'Brien (1993). In addition, he has been in over 50 feature motion pictures and hundreds of episodic TV shows. A decorated Infantry Platoon Leader in Vietnam, Clark brought the plight of the Vietnam Veteran to the people of America in a humorous way in the 80s and was \"adopted\" by numerous Veteran Organizations throughout the United States. Having moved from his home state of Georgia to Hollywood, Clark soon landed his first The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) and soon, thereafter, was cast in his first of many recurring roles on television as \"Fred the Chauffeur\" on Remington Steele (1982). Since then, he has been \"Harry\" on Home Improvement (1991), \"Jules Lambermont\" on The Drew Carey Show (1995), \"Chet Hunter\" on Boy Meets World (1993) and \"Bob Nelson\" on The Jamie Foxx Show (1996). But Clark is perhaps best known as \"Farmer Fran\" in The Waterboy (1998). And he recently received critical acclaim as \"Marlin Whitmore\" in 50 First Dates (2004). He has traveled the world doing comedy and recently went to Iraq for an extended USO Tour with Drew Carey. Clark is a warm, smart, funny and innovative social commentator and a man of all seasons with a quiet patriotism that he lives as well as portrays. His comedy runs the gamut from observation on the current military conflict to his Southern root in Georgia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2NTc4NDcyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc2MjcyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163703","name":"Blake Clark","idIMDB":"nm0163703"},"actorId":"nm0163703","character":"Wally","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jon Cutler","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193930","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jon Cutler is an actor and director, known for The Running Man (1987), St. Elmo's Fire (1985) and Ruthless People (1986).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193930","name":"Jon Cutler","idIMDB":"nm0193930"},"actorId":"nm0193930","character":"Howie Krantz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Laurance","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491005","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxNDU4MzMyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ1MDkwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 March 1950","placeOfBirth":" Queens, New York, USA","birthName":"Matthew Dyckoff","bio":"Matthew Laurance was born on March 2, 1950 in Queens, New York, USA as Matthew Dyckoff.
