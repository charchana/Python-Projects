On her way to see the Wizard, she meets the Scarecrow (Kermit), the Tin Thing (Gonzo), and the Cowardly Lion (Fozzie) who all wish to have something given by the wizard. On their way to Emerald City, they are captured by the Wicked Witch of the West (of course, Miss Piggy) and her flying monkeys (other muppets). When they finally make it back to Emerald City, the Wizard is really a man from Hollywood. But he \"grants\" their wishes, but what they wanted they already had inside (there's a lesson there).

Tambor was born and raised in San Francisco, to Eileen (Salzberg) and Michael Bernard Tambor, a flooring contractor. His family is Ashkenazi Jewish (from Hungary and Ukraine). He studied acting at San Francisco State University and earned his Bachelors of Arts degree there. Following his Masters at Wayne State University, he started building up his resume in repertory theater. He was first seen on episodic TV in the mid-'70s in both comedies (Taxi (1978), Barney Miller (1974)) and dramas (Kojak (1973), Starsky and Hutch (1975)). A large, somewhat looming fellow, his sly-eyed look and leering gaze, matched with a bright set of pearly teeth and stark pattern baldness, made him a natural for broad, warped comedy. The folks at Three's Company (1976) brought Jeffrey back time and time again, standing toe-to-toe with John Ritter and stealing many of their scenes with his noticeably bizarre gents. Before his \"Three's Company\" guest roles, he co-starred in the show's spin-off The Ropers (1979) with Norman Fell and Audra Lindley. He and Patty McCormack played the Ropers' chagrined neighbors. On the legitimate stage, he has been an earnest player over the years with performances in \"Sly Fox\" and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" on Broadway in addition to roles in \"Measure for Measure,\" \"A Flea in Her Ear\" and \"The Seagull.\" On the side, Jeffrey has directed a number of stage productions and teaches acting in the Los Angeles area. Although not as well known for his film work, he made a strong dramatic impression in his film debut ...and justice for all. (1979), in which he played Al Pacino's half-crazed law partner. He went on to enhance a number of other movies including The Dream Chasers (1984), Mr. Mom (1983), Brenda Starr (1989), Radioland Murders (1994), Doctor Dolittle (1998), Pollock (2000). More recently he played the Mayor of Whoville in How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). Emmy-nominated for his quirky work on The Larry Sanders Show (1992), Jeffrey's fondness and talent for the weird and wacky has recently found a nesting roost. Quite at home amid the insanity in the series Arrested Development (2003), he recently copped another Emmy nomination as the patriarch of the highly dysfunctional Bluth family.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQxMzA3NzQzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQxMDc3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001787","name":"Jeffrey Tambor","idIMDB":"nm0001787"},"actorId":"nm0001787","character":"Wizard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0088707","main":true},{"actorName":"Quentin Tarantino","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMjI3ODA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MDYxOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 March 1963","placeOfBirth":" Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","birthName":"Quentin Jerome Tarantino","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. His father, Tony Tarantino, is an Italian-American actor and musician from New York, and his mother, Connie (McHugh), is a nurse from Tennessee. Quentin moved with his mother to Torrance, California, when he was four years old. In January of 1992, first-time writer-director Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with Pulp Fiction (1994) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner Roger Avary came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology Four Rooms (1995) with friends and fellow auteurs Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and Allison Anders. The film opened December 25 in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with George Clooney. The film did fairly well theatrically. Since then, Tarantino has helmed several critically and financially successful films, including Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), Inglourious Basterds (2009), Django Unchained (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMjI3ODA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MDYxOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233","name":"Quentin Tarantino","nicknames":["QT","Q"],"idIMDB":"nm0000233"},"actorId":"nm0000233","character":"Quentin Tarantino - Kermit's Director","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0036229","main":true},{"actorName":"David Alan Grier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004979","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMTg4OTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjUyMDE0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1955","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"David Alan Grier was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Aretas Ruth (Dudley), a schoolteacher, and William Henry Grier, a psychiatrist and writer. He trained in Shakespeare at Yale University, where he received an MFA from the Yale School of Drama. Grier began his professional career on Broadway as Jackie Robinson in \"The First\", for which he earned a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and won the Theatre World Award (1981). He then joined the Broadway cast of \"Dreamgirls\", before going on to star opposite Denzel Washington in \"A Soldier's Play\", for which both actors reprised their roles in the film adaptation titled A Soldier's Story (1984). He appeared in Robert Altman's Streamers (1983) as \"Roger\", a role for which he won the Golden Lion for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (1983). His television work is highlighted by a turn as a principal cast member on the Emmy Award-winning In Living Color (1990) (1990-1994), where he helped to create some of the show's most memorable characters, \"DAG\" (2000-2001) and \"Life with Bonnie\" (2002-2004), for which he earned Image and Golden Satellite nominations. David also created, wrote and executive-produced a show for Comedy Central called Chocolate News (2008). Grier also won America's votes as a smooth, debonair, and outrageously irreverent contestant on ABC's smash hit, Dancing with the Stars (2005), in 2009. But Grier didn't hang up his dance shoes just then - he later appeared in the Wayans Brothers' spoof movie, Dance Flick (2009), which hit theaters in May 2009. In Grier's first book, \"Barack Like Me: The Chocolate Covered Truth\" (Touchstone / Simon & Schuster; October 6, 2009), the acclaimed comedian expounds on politics, culture and race while recounting his own life story in this edgy, timely, timeless, and hilarious memoir and look at all things Barack Obama. Grier returned to his theatrical roots 2009/2010; he starred in David Mamet's acclaimed play, \"Race\", opposite James Spader and Kerry Washington, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway for which he received a Tony Award nomination. He has been named one of Comedy Central's \"100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMTg4OTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjUyMDE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004979","name":"David Alan Grier","nicknames":["DAG","D.A.G."],"idIMDB":"nm0004979"},"actorId":"nm0004979","character":"Uncle Henry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004333","main":true},{"actorName":"Queen Latifah","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001451","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNjkxNzkyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1MTMyMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 March 1970","placeOfBirth":" Newark, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Dana Elaine Owens","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Often considered hip-hop's first lady (though some would attribute that to Roxanne Shanté), the woman behind the moniker Queen Latifah was born Dana Owens on March 18th, 1970, in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Rita (Bray), a teacher, and Lancelot Owens, Sr. She came from a police family--both her father and older brother were cops, which would later influence her rhyming style and life philosophy. Owens witnessed both sides of Black urban life in the USA while growing up. After a brief stint as a Burger King employee, she soon found herself making waves in the hip-hop music scene. After working as the human beat box alongside Ladies Fresh, she was just 18 years old when she originally broke through in the late 1980s with a style that picked selectively from jazz, reggae, and soul traditions, from beats produced by 'D.J. Mark the 45 King'. Her debut single, \"Wrath of My Madness,\" was released in 1988. A year later, her debut long-player, \"All Hail the Queen,\" enjoyed favored reviews: an old, wise head was evident on the top of her young shoulders. The former Burger King employee maintained her early commitment to answer the misogynist armory of some of her male counterparts and, at the same time, imparted musical good times to all genders. Her name means \"delicate and sensitive\" in Arabic, but she has often been anything but in her rhymes and the messages she sends out through them. One of the most prominent female hip-hop artists on the scene for over a decade, Queen Latifah has also made tremendous inroads in movies, television, and artist management, with her management company, Flavor Unit, alongside her business partner Shakim Compere. A role model who takes the responsibility to heart, Latifah carefully constructed a fine career for herself--one that is constantly moving upward.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNjkxNzkyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001451","name":"Queen Latifah","nicknames":["Hip-Hop's First Lady"],"idIMDB":"nm0001451"},"actorId":"nm0001451","character":"Aunt Em","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004332","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Whitmire","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0926209","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNDM3NzE0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4MDAyNzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 September 1958","placeOfBirth":" Atlanta, Georgia, USA","birthName":"Steven Lawrence Whitmire","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Steve Whitmire was born on September 24, 1958 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA as Steven Lawrence Whitmire.
