He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O' Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig is of English, as well as Welsh, Scottish, and Irish, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club. At the age of 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as \"Agamemnon\" in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig, was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in La puissance de l'ange (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray \"James Bond\", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool \"007\". He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as \"Bond\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMjk4NDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyNjQzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819","name":"Daniel Craig","idIMDB":"nm0185819"},"actorId":"nm0185819","character":"James Bond","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000007","main":true},{"actorName":"Eva Green","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1200692","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDA2ODE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI0Nzc3Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 July 1980","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Eva Gaëlle Green","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"French actress and model Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 6, 1980, in Paris, France. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film Au Hasard Balthazar (1966). Her mother, Marlène Jobert, is an actress turned children's book writer. Eva's mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva's father is of Swedish, French, and Breton descent. She has a fraternal twin sister, Joy. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University. She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: \"La Jalousie en Trois Fax\" and \"Turcaret\". There, she caught the eye of director Bernardo Bertolucci. Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing The Dreamers (2003) with Bernardo Bertolucci. During their work, Bertolucci described Green as being \"so beautiful it's indecent\". Green won critical acclaim for her role in The Dreamers (2003). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress, Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score. After \"The Dreamers\", Green's career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer, Adventures of Arsene Lupin (2004), opposite Romain Duris. In 2005, she co-starred, opposite Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson, in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), produced and directed by Ridley Scott. The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in Le dahlia noir (2006), that went to Hilary Swank, because she didn't want to end up typecast as a femme fatale after her role in \"The Dreamers\". Instead, Eva accepted the prestigious role of \"Vesper Lynd\", one of three Bond girls, opposite Daniel Craig, in Casino Royale (2006) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl, after Claudine Auger in Thunderball (1965), Corinne Cléry in Moonraker (1979), Carole Bouquet in For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Sophie Marceau in The World Is Not Enough (1999). She achieved international recognition for the film, one of the highest-grossing Bond movies ever. Since then, Green has starred in the films Dark Shadows (2012), 300: Rise of an Empire (2014), Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (2014), and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016). She also starred as Vanessa Ives in Showtime's horror drama \"Penny Dreadful\" (2014)_. Her performance in the series earned her a nomination for Best Actress in a Television Series - Drama at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards. Since her school years, Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can't speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities, outside of acting, include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDA2ODE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI0Nzc3Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1200692","name":"Eva Green","idIMDB":"nm1200692"},"actorId":"nm1200692","character":"Vesper Lynd","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000275","main":true},{"actorName":"Mads Mikkelsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0586568","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMTU5MzgxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDI0NjI1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" Østerbro, Copenhagen, Denmark","birthName":"Mads Dittman Mikkelsen","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Mads Mikkelsen is a synonym to the great success the Danish film industry has had since the mid-1990s.

Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990's Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright's harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright's skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NjE1OTg2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0OTI1MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942482","name":"Jeffrey Wright","idIMDB":"nm0942482"},"actorId":"nm0942482","character":"Felix Leiter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000313","main":true},{"actorName":"Giancarlo Giannini","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0316284","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMTMxNTMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY5Mzc1MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 August 1942","placeOfBirth":" La Spezia, Liguria, Italy","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Giancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.

She attended Athens High school in Troy, Michigan, and worked as a model during her school years. She became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1992, Milicevic graduated from high school and moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of an acting career. She was a struggling stand-up comedienne, trying to win over crowds with her stories of the modeling business. In 1996, she made her film debut under the name Ivana Marina with a one-line role as a Former Girlfriend of Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire (1996). In 1997, she followed up with a guest role on NBC's Seinfeld (1989) and made guest appearances on several other television shows, including Royal Pains (2009) and playing the love interest of John Casey on Chuck (2007). She played bit parts in Vanilla Sky (2001) and Love Actually (2003), among her many other cameo appearances. Milicevic capitalized on her experience as a comedienne in a supporting role as Russian model Roxana Milla Slasnikova in the romantic comedy Head Over Heels (2001). She appeared as a lookalike of Uma Thurman opposite Ben Affleck, trying to fool him into thinking she is Uma, in Paycheck (2003). In a departure from her one-dimensional roles, Milicevic showed her dramatic talent in a supporting role as Milla Yugorsky in a dark and gritty drama Running Scared (2006). In 2006, she started a recurring role on the CBS TV series Love Monkey (2006). In 2006, Milicevic made a big step forward in her career appearing as Valenka, one of three Bond girls in Casino Royale (2006), for which she did most of her scenes on locations in Prague and in London. She resides in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAwNjY5MzYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc0MDk4OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587431","name":"Ivana Milicevic","idIMDB":"nm0587431"},"actorId":"nm0587431","character":"Valenka","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000301","main":true},{"actorName":"Tobias Menzies","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580014","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxMzU0NTIxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE4ODAzMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 March 1974","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Tobias was born in London.
