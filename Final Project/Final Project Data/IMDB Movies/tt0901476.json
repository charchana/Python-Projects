Through some combination of a winning smile, solid work ethic, and good old-fashioned talent, the young actress has gone from indie beginner to Vanity Fair cover girl in just three years. What's more, she's done it all without capitalizing on the success of legendary actress mom, Goldie Hawn. Kate Hudson was born in Los Angeles, California, to Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson, a comedian, actor and musician. She was raised by her mother and her mother's partner, actor Kurt Russell, whom she considers to be her father. Kate is the sister of actor Oliver Hudson, the half-sister of actor and hockey player Wyatt Russell, and the granddaughter of band musician Rut Hawn. Kate is of Hungarian Jewish (from her maternal grandmother), Italian (from her paternal grandmother), English, and German ancestry. By all accounts, Hudson was a born performer - as a child she danced and sang at every opportunity. Her family hoped that she would attend New York University after graduating from high school, but she opted to get her feet wet in the professional acting world first. She made her big-screen debut as an ambitious young starlet stranded in a tiny California town in Desert Blue (1998). Her next two films, while critically panned, made it into wider release: 200 Cigarettes (1999) (in which she played an earnest but accident-prone ditz) and Gossip (2000) (which cast her as a rich, virginal college student). Perhaps Hudson's biggest break was landing the role of rock groupie (or \"Band Aide\") Penny Lane in Almost Famous (2000). The part was originally intended for Sarah Polley; when Polley backed out to pursue another project, director Cameron Crowe considered scrapping the film altogether. Hudson, who had been cast in a smaller role (as William's stewardess sister), begged for a chance to read for Penny. Crowe was impressed, Hudson got the part, and the show went on. As much as Tinseltown gossipmongers would like to put them at odds, mother and daughter agree that Hawn is one of Hudson's biggest supporters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NTk0MjMyOTFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA4NzEzMTM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005028","name":"Kate Hudson","nicknames":["Katie"],"idIMDB":"nm0005028"},"actorId":"nm0005028","character":"Liv","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0390284","main":true},{"actorName":"Anne Hathaway","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ5MTAxMDc5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0OTE4OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 November 1982","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Anne Jacqueline Hathaway","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Anne Jacqueline Hathaway was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Kate McCauley Hathaway, an actress, and Gerald T. Hathaway, a lawyer, both originally from Philadelphia. She is of mostly Irish descent, along with English, German, and French. Her first major role came in the short-lived television series Get Real (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in The Princess Diaries (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she is a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo. She also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of \"Christine\" in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn't take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum. Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her \"Princess Diaries\" image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn't mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ5MTAxMDc5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0OTE4OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266","name":"Anne Hathaway","nicknames":["Annie"],"idIMDB":"nm0004266"},"actorId":"nm0004266","character":"Emma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0389599","main":true},{"actorName":"Bryan Greenberg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1034965","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0ODE2OTE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAyOTAyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1978","placeOfBirth":" Omaha, Nebraska, USA","birthName":"Bryan E.

A staunch, outspoken feminist with a decisive edge, she went on to take a sizable portion of these contradicting qualities to film and, most particularly, to late 80s TV. The daughter of famed ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and former actress and \"Chesterfield Girl\" Frances Bergen, Candice Patricia Bergren was born in Beverly Hills, California, surrounded by Hollywood glitter and glamour from day one. She is of Swedish, German, and English descent. At the age of six, she made her radio debut on her father's show. Of extreme privilege, she attended Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles, the Cathedral School in Washington D.C. and then went abroad to the Montesano (finishing) School in Switzerland. Although she began taking art history and creative drawing at the University of Pennsylvania, she did not graduate due to less-than-stellar grades. In between studies, she also worked as a Ford model in order to buy cameras for her new passion--photography. Her Grace Kelly-like glacial beauty deemed her an ideal candidate for Ivy League patrician roles, and Candice made an auspicious film debut while still a college student portraying the Vassar-styled lesbian member of Sidney Lumet's The Group (1966) in an ensemble that included the debuts of other lovely up-and-comers including Joan Hackett and Joanna Pettet. Film offers started coming her way, both here and especially abroad (spurred on by her love for travel). Other than her top-notch roles as the co-ed who comes between Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel in Carnal Knowledge (1971) and her prim American lady kidnapped by Moroccan sheik Sean Connery in The Wind and the Lion (1975), her performances were deemed a bit too aloof to really stand out among the crowd. During this time, she found a passionate second career as a photographer and photojournalist. A number of her works went on to appear in an assortment of magazines including Life, Playboy and Esquire. Most of Candice's 1970s films were either unmemorable or dismissed altogether, including the campus comedy Getting Straight (1970) opposite the hip counterculture star of the era -- Elliott Gould; the disturbingly violent Soldier Blue (1970); the epic-sized bomb The Adventurers (1970); T.R. Baskin (1971); Bite the Bullet (1975); The Domino Killings (1977), Lina Wertmüller's long-winded and notoriously long-titled Italian drama A Night Full of Rain (1978); and the inferior sequel to the huge box-office soaper Love Story (1970), entitled Oliver's Story (1978) alongside original star Ryan O'Neal. Things picked up toward the second half of the decade, however, when the seemingly humorless Candice took a swipe at comedy. She made history as the first female guest host of Saturday Night Live (1975) and then showed an equally amusing side of her in the dramedy Starting Over (1979) as Burt Reynolds' tone-deaf ex-wife, enjoying a \"best supporting actress\" Oscar nomination in the process. She and Jacqueline Bisset also worked well as a team in George Cukor's Rich and Famous (1981), in which her mother Frances could be glimpsed in a Malibu party scene. Candice also made her Broadway debut in 1985 replacing Sigourney Weaver in David Rabe's black comedy \"Hurlyburly\". In 1980 Candice married Louis Malle, the older (by 14 years) French director. They had one child, Chloe. In the late 80s, Candice hit a new career plateau on comedy television as the spiky title role on Murphy Brown (1988), giving great gripe as the cynical and competitive anchor/reporter of a TV magazine show. With a superlative supporting cast around her, the CBS sitcom went the distance (ten seasons) and earned Candice a whopping five Emmys and two Golden Globe awards. TV-movie roles also came her way as a result with colorful roles ranging from the evil Arthurian temptress \"Morgan Le Fey\" to an elite, high-classed madam -- all many moons away from her initial white-gloved debs of the late 60s. Malle's illness and subsequent death from cancer in 1995 resulted in Candice maintaining a very low profile for quite some time. Since then, however, she has returned with a renewed vigor (or should I say vinegar) on TV, with many of her characters enjoyable extensions of her \"Murphy Brown\" curmudgeon. Lightweight fare such as Miss Congeniality (2000), Sweet Home Alabama (2002) and The In-Laws (2003) have had her chomping again at the comedy bit. In 2005, she joined the cast of Boston Legal (2004) playing a brash, no-nonsense lawyer while trading barbs with a much less serious William Shatner, earning an Emmy nomination the following year. Her second husband (since 2000) is Marshall Rose, a Manhattan real estate developer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MTM1MTIxNTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDc4NDY2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000298","name":"Candice Bergen","nicknames":["Candy"],"idIMDB":"nm0000298"},"actorId":"nm0000298","character":"Marion","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0456496","main":true},{"actorName":"Kristen Johnston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005060","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMDIwNTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg1MTQyMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 September 1967","placeOfBirth":" Washington, District of Columbia, USA","birthName":"Kristen Angela Johnston","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Kristen Johnston studied acting at the Atlantic Theater Company Acting School in New York City.

Victor's earliest influences in entertainment came through the screen of Jack and Sam's Warner Brothers Theater, where his mother was a box office girl. So, too, was the black and white TV set in his parents' living room an early influence. He cites seeing Montgomery Clift in _Freud_, James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and George C. Scott in the old East Side/West Side (1963) series as performances that piqued his earliest interest. The Franciscan nuns at Saint Stanislaus Grade School taught in the Jesuit mode, placing heavy weight on the correct use of language and oratory skill. Theatre was used as a teaching tool. At an early age, Victor's acting in, directing, and writing plays stemming from the Bible became a normal part of his daily routine and education. His talent and efforts gained recognition when he was asked to join a select handful of students in reading the Book of Genesis aloud to their church congregation. Toward the end of high school, after being selected and appearing in leads in the school plays, Victor's guidance counselor pulled him out of class to announce good news: he'd been awarded a scholarship to study acting at Ohio State. Victor turned it down. The summer before, Victor had spent 10 weeks as an apprentice at the Lakewood Musical Playhouse. There was another force and first love begging for his attention. From an early age he spent his free time making drawings in pencil and ink. He couldn't see himself pursuing acting as a career after seeing those amazing performers drawing their 75 dollar a week paycheck and no job after the ten weeks. So, at the ripe old age of 17, he moved to New York City to become a visual artist. He was on the fast track to become an advertising art director when a friend who worked as a scenic designer from that summer of stock called from out of the blue and asked Victor if he'd like to paint scenery for the venerable Chautauqua Opera Company in western New York state. Victor arranged for a brief leave of absence from the advertising firm. A life in the theatre had called to him by a most circuitous route. Victor never went back to the ad firm. When his work at Chautauqua ended, he landed a job stage managing variety acts - a country/western band, a juggler, and a magician - at the Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio. In an era before Amazon or Barnes and Noble existed, he began to hunt for books on acting. Victor's first introduction to Uta Hagen was in his Speech and Drama class where he heard a recording of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\". His first professional jobs came from regional theatre, roles like Rodolfo in A View from the Bridge at the Berkshire Theatre Festival and several stints at Hartford Stage, including Eben in Desire Under the Elms playing opposite Frances Fisher; Whit in Of Mice and Men with fellow Youngstowner Ed O'Neill, and Algernon in The Importance of Being Ernest with Mary Louise Parker. Exceptional material and the chance to work with great artists kept Victor in New York when so many of his peers moved west to pursue Los Angeles. Stage jobs in the city soon beckoned. Victor's performance as Lachlen in The Hasty Heart at Mirror Repertory off-Broadway led to his being cast opposite Geraldine Page at the same venue in a Ibsen's Ghosts, directed by Austin Pendleton. Television jobs followed including a recurring role on ABC's \"Guiding Light\". Broadway beckoned in 1993. Victor played John Cleary in Frank Gilroy's Any Given Day (the precursor to The Subject was Roses) alongside Sada Thompson at the Longacre Theatre, following that playing Dr. Sugar in Tennessee Williams' Suddenly Last Summer at Circle in the Square with Elizabeth Ashley, JFK in Jackie: An American Life with Margaret Colin at the Belasco, Mr. Robinson in The Graduate with Kathleen Turner at the Plymouth Theatre, and John the Baptist in Salome with Al Pacino at the Barrymore Theatre. Film roles began to pop up as well: The Devil's Own (1997) directed by Alan J. Pakula with Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt; The Bridges of Madison County (1995) with Meryl Streep, directed by Clint Eastwood. After Uta Hagen's death in 2004, Victor received phone calls from HB Studios asking him to consider teaching. Harkening to a need to give back to the school and the craft that had nurtured him, he eventually agreed to work a class into his schedule \"I went to teach my first class and found that the Studio had put me in the same room where I'd first met Uta.\" Today, Victor serves on the Board of the HB Playwrights Foundation, a position he's held since 2009 and makes time each year to be a part of their CORE program. He is also a member of the Actor's Studio and The Ensemble Studio Theater. He is known throughout the industry for the research he brings to playing roles of particular power and complexity (Enrico Brulard, the totalitarian chef on HBO's _Treme_; the Deputy Director of CIA in John Singleton's feature Abduction; Jamie Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's Moon for the Misbegotten at the Pittsburgh Public Theatre; Mike Wallace in the Broadway-bound musical Superfly, directed by Bill T. Jones).

He dabbled in drama during high school, but didn't become serious about acting until enrolled at Northeastern Illinois University, where he majored in theater arts. He left the university in his junior year after he attended a performance of David Mamet's \"The American Buffalo\" at the St. Nicholas Theater in Chicago. Inspired by the play, he enrolled in the theater's two-year theatrical training program in order to concentrate solely on acting. While visiting a friend in New York City, Pankow auditioned for, and won, a role in a PBS film entitled Great Performances: Life on the Mississippi (1980). He went on to perform in several off-Broadway productions including \"Scheherazade\", \"Aristocrats\", \"Italian American Reconciliation\", \"Hunting Scenes\", \"Ice Cream/Hot Fudge\" and the New York Shakespeare Festival's \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" and \"Henry VIII\". He subsequently made it to Broadway with \"Serious Money\", \"The Iceman Cometh\", and as Mozart in \"Amadeus\", one of his most notable roles to date. In recent years he has reprised the role of 'Stefano' in the runaway hit production of Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" in Central Park. Pankow has several motion pictures to his credit, including A Stranger Among Us (1992), Mortal Thoughts (1991), Talk Radio (1988), To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), and The Secret of My Succe$s (1987). On the television side, Pankow has guest starred on such series as Law & Order (1990), Spenser: For Hire (1985), and Miami Vice (1984). After several guest spots in the first season of Mad About You (1992), he was signed as a cast regular. Pankow is currently involved in developing projects for himself in the theater both as an actor and director. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking for his wife and their daughter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMDgyMzQ4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE3NzcyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0659601","name":"John Pankow","idIMDB":"nm0659601"},"actorId":"nm0659601","character":"John","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Zoe O'Grady","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3021880","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAzOTUwMjQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI4MDQ0MjE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Zoe O'Grady is an actress, known for Bride Wars (2009), The Rebound (2009) and Caught in the Middle (2013).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzAzOTUwMjQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI4MDQ0MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3021880","name":"Zoe O'Grady","idIMDB":"nm3021880"},"actorId":"nm3021880","character":"Young Liv","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0121870","main":true},{"actorName":"Shannon Ferber","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3238546","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Shannon Ferber is an actress, known for Bride Wars (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3238546","name":"Shannon Ferber","idIMDB":"nm3238546"},"actorId":"nm3238546","character":"Young Emma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0183530","main":true},{"actorName":"June Diane Raphael","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2053085","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NjI4NjU0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk3ODI5NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 January 1980","placeOfBirth":" Rockville Centre, Long Island, New York, USA","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"June Diane Raphael was born on January 4, 1980 in Rockville Centre, Long Island, New York, USA.
