His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one's back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable \"tough guy\" performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in \"Extremities\" on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized Farrah Fawcett), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include Kevin Costner's The Postman (1997) and Open Range (2003), plus Beverly Hills Cop (1984), We're No Angels (1989), Donnie Brasco (1997), No Way Home (1996), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has \"Welcome to Andromeda\", \"Deathwatch\", \"Marat/Sade\" and the afore-mentioned \"Extremities\" to his credit. Russo appeared opposite Johnny Depp in Roman Polanski's La neuvième porte (1999), and portrayed mobster \"Victor Mura\" in TV's short-lived, Falcone (2000), the following year.

Rossi was born in 1947 in Trenton, New Jersey and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Leo first began acting in community theater. Although often cast as mean, loutish and despicable characters (he's portrayed more than his fair share of made Mafia guys as well as a substantial number of cops and government agents), Rossi has shown on many occasions that he can play more appealing and sympathetic roles with equal skill and conviction. Leo was solid as crass'n'crude sexist pig \"Budd\" in Halloween II (1981). He has appeared in several movies for director Jonathan Kaplan: he was excellent as Bonnie Bedelia's insecure, but basically decent husband \"Jack Muldowney\" in the wonderful Heart Like a Wheel (1983) and memorably chilling as the vile jerk who cheers on Jodie Foster's barroom rape in the acclaimed Les accusés (1988). Moreover, Leo has acted in three pictures for director William Lustig: very likable as antsy mob witness \"Frank DeSalvo\" in Hit List (1989), extremely engaging as eager beaver rookie homicide detective \"Sam Dietz\" in Relentless (1989) (Rossi reprised this part in three sequels and even co-produced the last two entries), and really funny as crazed serial killer \"Turkell\" in Maniac Cop 2 (1990). More recently, Rossi had a nice sizable supporting role as Robert De Niro's evil cousin \"Carlo\" in the hit comedy Analyze This (1999). Among the TV shows Leo Rossi has done guest spots on are ER (1994), Frasier (1993), Murder, She Wrote (1984), Tour of Duty (1987), 21 Jump Street (1987), Cagney & Lacey (1981), T.J.
