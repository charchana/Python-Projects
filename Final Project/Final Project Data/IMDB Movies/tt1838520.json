Her surname comes from her mother's Italian grandfather. Thanks to her mother, Kaya grew up fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, as well as English. At the age of fourteen, she auditioned for Skins (2007), the debut series for new channel E4 that would become known for casting real teenagers like her, who had no professional acting experience, rather than experienced adult actors. She won the role of \"Effy Stonem\" and joined the show in January 2007. After an challenging debut in which she never spoke, Scodelario and Effy made quite an impression on viewers. At the forefront of many disasters, including stalkers, death, and sexual pressures, Effy became a fan favorite for her ability to resolve testing life situations while keeping her head above water. As the character and the role grew, Scodelario enjoyed depicting what she described as the realistic trials and challenges Effy faced with friendships, relationships, and adolescence. After two seasons of Skins (2007), the series endured an overhaul at the end of 2007. Feeling that most of the characters had run their course, the writers wrote out every character except Effy. This put significantly more pressure on Scodelario because it meant that she would be the most recognizable face for season three. As she waited for the new season of Skins (2007) to begin, she took advantage of her recent clout to seek out additional career opportunities. She joined the elite agency Models 1 and soon was featured as the cover model for SuperSuper Magazine. She also made her feature film debut with a role in the 2009 film Moon (2009), starring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut suffering from surreal encounters while on the moon. With a blossoming film career and her successful TV series to fall back on, Kaya Scodelario is certainly someone to watch.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk5NjE5NTczMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI0OTM0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2546012","name":"Kaya Scodelario","idIMDB":"nm2546012"},"actorId":"nm2546012","character":"Emanuel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0389041","main":true},{"actorName":"Jessica Biel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004754","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDY2NzMwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIxNTUxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 March 1982","placeOfBirth":" Ely, Minnesota, USA","birthName":"Jessica Claire Biel","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Jessica Biel, with her good looks and talent, has become one of Hollywood's most sought-out actresses. She was born in Ely, Minnesota, to Kimberly (Conroe) and Jonathan Edward Biel, who is a business consultant and GM worker. Biel was raised in Boulder, Colorado. She is of Hungarian Jewish, Danish, English, and German descent. As a child, Jessica initially pursued a career as a vocalist, performing in musical theater. Beginning at age nine, she starred in such productions as \"Annie,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" and \"Beauty and the Beast.\" A natural beauty, Jessica soon turned to modeling and commercial work by competing in The International Modeling and Talent Association's Annual Conference in 1994. Her television series acting debut, playing Mary Camden on the WB's #1-rated show, 7th Heaven (1996), helped her emerge as a breakout star. She then excited and terrified moviegoers with her portrayal of Erin, \"Leatherface's\" greatest nemesis to date, in New Line Cinema's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), a remake of the famous original. Having finished filming, Blade: Trinity (2004) in Vancouver with Wesley Snipes, Ryan Reynolds, and Kris Kristofferson, she transported her toned and trained body of a vampire hunter/killer to Australia to fill the uniform and project the integrity of one of filmdom's first female jet-fighter pilots in Columbia/Sony Pictures new film, Stealth (2005), starring Josh Lucas, Jamie Foxx, and Sam Shepherd, for director Rob Cohen. Jessica's film career began at age 14 when she played alongside Peter Fonda in his Golden Globe-winning performance in Ulee's Gold (1997). Her other film credits include I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998), Summer Catch (2001), Roger Avary's The Rules of Attraction (2002), and Cellular (2004), which stars Chris Evans, Kim Basinger, and William H. Macy. In her spare time, Biel is involved with charities such as Best Friends Animal Sanctuary and PETA. Her hobbies include ballet, soccer, running, yoga and hiking with her dog \"East.\" She resides in Los Angeles. In 2012, Jessica married actor and singer Justin Timberlake. The two have a son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDY2NzMwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIxNTUxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004754","name":"Jessica Biel","nicknames":["Jesse"],"idIMDB":"nm0004754"},"actorId":"nm0004754","character":"Linda","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0315573","main":true},{"actorName":"Frances O'Connor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0640323","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODE4NTY3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzYyODE2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 June 1967","placeOfBirth":" Wantage, Oxfordshire, England, UK","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Frances O'Connor was born on June 12, 1967 in Wantage, Oxfordshire, England.

He also spent several seasons doing theater in NY before making the move to Los Angeles. Once in LA, he landed parts in two feature films, Traffic (2000) and Behind Enemy Lines (2001). After those standout roles, he won the powerful role, opposite Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell in MGM's Hart's War (2002). In the years following, Jaeger has built an impressive television resume, including roles in such hits as ER (1994), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), The West Wing (1999), NYPD Blue (1993), Scrubs (2001), That's Life (2000) and Girls Club (2002).

Written and directed by Susannah Grant, writer of Erin Brockovich (2000) and In Her Shoes (2005), the film opened in January 2007. In addition to his film and small screen credits, Jaeger has also co-written and co-produced two short films. The first, \"Quiz Bowl\", caught the eye of actress Kate Bosworth (Superman Returns (2006)), who later agreed to star in his next short, Advantage Hart (2003). \"Advantage Hart\" had its premiere at The Hollywood Film Festival. Jaeger's directorial debut, the short Untold (2009), is a period piece set in his home state of Ohio. Samuel Heath Jaeger was born in Perrysburg, to LeAnne (Graening) and Charles Jaeger.
