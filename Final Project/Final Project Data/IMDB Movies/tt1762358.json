Seton was born in Sydney, Australia. He was raised in Sydney's Western Suburbs then moved with his family to Wombeyan Caves located in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales where he lived without electricity for a year and a half. Reading and telling stories by candle light with his three brothers sparked his interest in acting. His family moved back to Sydney where he attended St Ignatius College. He immersed himself in the theatre department and discovered a love for the Bard. In 1995 he won the Australian Young Shakespearean Artist of the year award and was presented the College Blue for Drama in 1996. At the same time he was competing in International Tae Kwon Do Tournaments and was the South Pacific Champion in 1995. He combined his loves in a unique sellout show called \"Tae Kwon Shakespeare\". This gained him recognition and he guest starred in BeastMaster, le dernier des survivants (1999) and The Lost World (2001). He co-starred with Lara Cox in The Dinner Party (2009) and moved to Los Angeles where he appeared on Fox Networks On the Lot (2007) and judges Garry Marshall, Michael Bay and Carrie Fisher commended him on an \"excellent performance\".
