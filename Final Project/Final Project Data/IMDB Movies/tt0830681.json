He landed a role and from that moment on lived, ate and drank the theater. For the next five years he went to every theater in Atlanta and auditioned for almost everything that came along. This included a TV pilot for The Catlins (1982) which led to a two year contract. He got a part in The Bear (1984), with Gary Busey and then a role in a TV movie called Poison Ivy (1985), with 'Michael J. Fox', 'Adam Baldwin' and Nancy McKeon. Work dried up until Brett started a fantastic run of luck in which he worked solidly thru the 90s.
