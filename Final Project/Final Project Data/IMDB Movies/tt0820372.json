She has posed for Playboy magazine and appeared in one of their videos, Playboy: Girls of the Internet. Gabriella was born in Los Angeles but grew up on the beaches of Northern California. She auditioned for fashion print work on a whim as a way to pay for veterinarian school. Her fashion print work led to runway modeling in Europe before she returned to California. Gabriella had always been fascinated with movies from when she was a little girl with Rita Hayworth being her favorite actress at the time. Her first major role was in a movie called Centerfold (later renamed Naked Ambition). After that, she would go on to appear in 18 features over the next two years. It was her appearance in the Nicolas Roeg drama, Full Body Massage, (as the younger flashback of Mimi Rogers' character, Nina) that drew the attention of film producers such as Curtis Hansen, and kept her steadily employed in a variety of movies. In her spare time Gabriella enjoys playing with animals, reading, and cooking with friends.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355588","name":"Gabriella Hall","idIMDB":"nm0355588"},"actorId":"nm0355588","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Lazar","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493677","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NDYyNDI3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODU3NDYzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR11,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 May 1946","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"John Edward Lazar","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"John La Zar was born and raised in San Francisco, California. He trained at the American Conservatory Theatre and has studied acting with Uta Hagen, Bill Ball, Jack Kosslyn, and Paul Shenar. La Zar was portraying the titular role in a University of Hawaii stage production of \"Caligula\" when he was approached by 20th Century Fox studio casting agent Phil Benjamin to audition for the part of deranged and debauched rock'n'roll music producer Ronnie 'Z-Man' Barzell in Russ Meyer's delightfully outrageous camp cult classic \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.\" John's wonderfully wild and eccentric performance as 'Z-Man' should have led to bigger and better things, but alas did not. A majority of La Zar's subsequent roles have been decidedly minor: funny as sleazy pimp Carl McKinney in Meyer's typically off-the-wall \"Supervixens,\" a Palestine general in the \"David & Goliath\" episode of \"Greatest Heroes of the Bible,\" a limousine driver in \"Eddie Presley,\" a warlock in \"Night of the Scarecrow,\" and a strip club patron in \"Stripteaser.\" However, on occasion John has landed a more substantial part; he's especially memorable as evil sorcerer Jarek in the enjoyably silly tongue-in-cheek sword and sorcery fantasy hoot \"Deathstalker II.\" La Zar had a recurring role as scientist Dr. Fez on the soft-core cable TV series \"Click.\" In addition to his regrettably sparse film and TV credits, John has acted in stage productions of such plays as \"The Crucible,\" \"Macbeth,\" \"Carnival,\" \"High Mass,\" \"No Exit,\" and \"Everyman.\" Outside of acting, La Zar is also a ballet dancer, master swordsman, and expert martial artist. He lives in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5NDYyNDI3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODU3NDYzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493677","name":"John Lazar","idIMDB":"nm0493677"},"actorId":"nm0493677","character":"Dr. Fez","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0112887","main":true},{"actorName":"Kim Sill","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206174","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNDcyODg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI0MTUwOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 December 1963","placeOfBirth":" Tifton, Georgia, USA","birthName":"Kimberly Dawn Dawson","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Kim Sill was born on December 8, 1963 in Tifton, Georgia, USA as Kimberly Dawn Dawson.
