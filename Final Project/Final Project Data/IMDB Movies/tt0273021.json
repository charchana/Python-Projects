He began his career when, studying politics and philosophy at York University (1992 - 1995), he got interested in amateur dramatics and traveled to the Edinburgh festival twice. A decision to raise funds to study at the prestigious Bristol Old Vic Theatre School resulted in an extra's job on a new film adaptation of the classic novel Jane Eyre. When director Franco Zeffirelli heard Richard was about to start drama school he gave him a line, his first on screen: \"Mr. Rochester, Mr. Rochester, your house sir!\" He then took a number of small roles in television and film before landing a larger role in the 1998 ITV drama The Life and Crimes of William Palmer (1998) and a super cameo turn in Justin Kerrigan's Human Traffic (1999) as \"Andy\" - a party goer engaged in some seriously \"deep\" debate on Star Wars and drugs culture with Danny Dyer's character \"Moff\". In 2000 Richard landed the two roles that would launch him into the limelight: \"Jeff\" in BBC2's inspired comedy series Coupling (2000) and \"John Ridd\" in the BBC's Christmas production of Lorna Doone (2000). Richard has trodden the boards in the West End, firstly at The Royal Court Theatre in Peter Gill's \"The York Realist\" and then alongside Gwyneth Paltrow in \"Proof\" at the Donmar Warehouse. Also \"Don Carlos\" in 2005 and \"The Lover/The Collection\" in 2008.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU5MDM2MTk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2MDM4OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185404","name":"Richard Coyle","idIMDB":"nm0185404"},"actorId":"nm0185404","character":"Trimmer McTavish","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Daniel Craig","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMjk4NDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyNjQzMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 March 1968","placeOfBirth":" Chester, Cheshire, England, UK","birthName":"Daniel Wroughton Craig","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces, who waited tables as a struggling teenage actor with the National Youth Theatre, went on to star as \"James Bond\" in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015). He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O' Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig is of English, as well as Welsh, Scottish, and Irish, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Live and Let Die (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club. At the age of 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as \"Agamemnon\" in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig, was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in La puissance de l'ange (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Road to Perdition (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Layer Cake (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray \"James Bond\", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munich (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool \"007\". He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as \"Bond\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMjk4NDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyNjQzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819","name":"Daniel Craig","idIMDB":"nm0185819"},"actorId":"nm0185819","character":"Guy Crouchback","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0123881","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0273021","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273021","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["3 hr 11 min (191 min) (2 parts)","3 hr 28 min (208 min) (2 parts) (Netherlands)"],"soundMix":["Stereo"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.5","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[{"award":"Royal Television Society, UK 2001","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won RTS Television Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Production Design - Drama","names":[{"name":"Ben Scott","id":"nm0778875","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Make Up Design - Drama","names":[{"name":"Anne Oldham","id":"nm0636463","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Music - Original Score","names":[{"name":"Nina Humphreys","id":"nm0402016","role":null}]}]},{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated RTS Television Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Sound - Drama","names":[{"name":"Richard Manton","id":"nm0544157","role":null},{"name":"Adrian Rhodes","id":"nm0722376","role":null},{"name":"Andy Kennedy","id":"nm0447905","role":null},{"name":"Andre Schmidt","id":"nm0772804","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"644","type":"TV Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0103588","name":"TalkBack Productions"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["based on novel"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 11:05:52"}}
