He is of mostly English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Everett grew up in privileged circumstances, but the wry, sometimes arrogant, intellectual was a rebel from the very beginning. At the age of seven, he was placed into the care of Benedictine monks at Ampleforth College where he trained classically on the piano. He was expelled from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London for clashing with his teachers and instead apprenticed himself at the avant-garde Glasgow Citizen's Theatre in Scotland, performing in such productions as 'Don Juan' and 'Heartbreak House'. In 1984 Everett successfully filmed a lead role in Another Country (1984), which he had performed earlier on stage and shot to international attention, becoming one of England's hottest new star. But again the wickedly sharp and suave rebel doused his own fire by clashing with the press and even with his own fans. In 1989 Everett openly declared his own homosexuality -- an announcement that could have mortally wounded his film career. Instead, over time, it seems to have had the opposite effect. His career revitalized as Julia Roberts' gay confidante in My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), and he has continued to impress notably in the classics area with Shakespeare in Love (1998) (as Christopher Marlowe), An Ideal Husband (1999) and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999) (as Oberon). Lately he has enhanced both films with his royal portrayals in To Kill a King (2003) and Stage Beauty (2004), and television with his effortlessly suave Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking (2004). His predilection for smug and smarmy villains of late such as the cartoonish Dr. Claw in Inspector Gadget (1999) has extended into voice animation with his \"unprincely\" Prince Charming character in Shrek 2 (2004). In making his landmark decision to \"come out\", Rupert becomes a living testament disproving the theory that a truly talented and successful romantic leading man cannot survive the career-killing stigma of being openly gay.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQzMDM2ODE3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDkxODE2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000391","name":"Rupert Everett","idIMDB":"nm0000391"},"actorId":"nm0000391","character":"Carnaby Fritton / Camilla Fritton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0103816","main":true},{"actorName":"Jodie Whittaker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2092886","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3ODQzOTU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1ODM2MzE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1982","placeOfBirth":" Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Jodie Auckland Whittaker","height":"5' 5¾\" (1.67 m)","bio":"Jodie Whittaker was born in 1982 in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England as Jodie Auckland Whittaker.

She was named 'Juno' after her parents took a visit to the Grand Canyon, during pregnancy, and found they were standing on a butte of Cape Final known as Juno Temple. She has English and Scottish ancestry. Her family moved to America, where she spent the first 4 years of her life. The family then moved back to England and settled in Somerset. At age 4, she decided she wanted to be an actor after her father showed her Belle et la Bête by Jean Cocteau. She attended Enmore Primary School in Somerset. It was during this time that her father cast her in his film Vigo: A Passion for Life (1998). However, her father ended up cutting her out of the film. Two years later, age 11, her father cast her in another of his films, Pandaemonium (2000). She became a weekly boarder at King's College boarding school in Taunton. She then moved on to Bedales boarding school in Hampshire to take her A-Levels, one of which was Drama. She left with a B and two C's. At age 15, she told her parents that she was serious about becoming an actor. Her mother saw a call for an open audition for Notes on a Scandal (2006), and Juno was successful in winning the role of Cate Blanchett's daughter. This was her big break and led to a role in another high profile film, Atonement (2007). She dyed her hair red to play Lola. In 2009, Juno moved to Los Angeles, partly to be with her boyfriend and partly for her acting career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NDU5OTY5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE5ODA5OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1017334","name":"Juno Temple","idIMDB":"nm1017334"},"actorId":"nm1017334","character":"Celia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0052381","main":true},{"actorName":"Antonia Bernath","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1553405","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY0OTQ5MzU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMxMzU4MjE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1980","placeOfBirth":" Westminster, London, England, UK","bio":"Antonia was born in England but was raised in Virginia, USA till she was 12.
