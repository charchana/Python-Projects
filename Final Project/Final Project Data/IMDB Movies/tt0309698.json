Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John's siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago's Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall's geek brigade in Sixteen Candles (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like The Sure Thing (1985) and Better Off Dead... (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything... (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in The Grifters (1990). The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins' Actors' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack's high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime's first feature was the sharply written comedy Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film's financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack's next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case. Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby's popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he's so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He's also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn't reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTAwMjYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxNTU1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131","name":"John Cusack","nicknames":["Johnny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000131"},"actorId":"nm0000131","character":"Ed","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008349","main":true},{"actorName":"Ray Liotta","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000501","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzM5MjUwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM2NDky._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 December 1954","placeOfBirth":" Newark, New Jersey, USA","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Intense is the word for Ray Liotta. He specializes in psychopathic characters who hide behind a cultivated charm. Even in his nice guy roles in Field of Dreams (1989) and Operation Dumbo Drop (1995), you get the impression that something is smoldering inside of him. Liotta maintains a steady stream of work, completing multiple projects per year. Liotta was born in Newark, New Jersey, and was adopted by Mary (Edgar), a township clerk, and Alfred Liotta, an auto parts store owner. He studied acting at the University of Miami, where he became friends with Steven Bauer (Scarface (1983), Thief of Hearts (1984)). He spent his first years acting in TV: Another World (1964), a TV movie and several short-lived series. He broke into movies with the black comedy Something Wild (1986), which garnered him rave reviews. Originally unable to get a reading, he was recommended for the part by Melanie Griffith (then married to Bauer). After the success of \"Something Wild\" he received more offers in the \"psycho\" vein, but refused them to avoid being typecast. Instead, he made \"little movies\" like Dominick and Eugene (1988) (which earned him standing as an actor's actor) and Field of Dreams (1989) (whose success still surprises him). When he heard that Martin Scorsese was casting Goodfellas (1990), he lobbied hard for the part of Henry Hill. The film's huge success brought him wide popularity and enabled him to get star billing in future films (Article 99 (1992), Obsession fatale (1992), Unforgettable (1996)).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzM5MjUwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM2NDky._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000501","name":"Ray Liotta","idIMDB":"nm0000501"},"actorId":"nm0000501","character":"Rhodes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008351","main":true},{"actorName":"Amanda Peet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001605","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3Nzk0NjgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI3NDE1Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 January 1972","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Amanda Peet was born and raised in New York City. She is the daughter of Penny (Levy), a social worker, and Charles Peet, a lawyer, and has an older sister. Her father was of mostly English and German ancestry, and her mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany, Russia, and Hungary). Peet's great-grandfathers were politician Samuel Levy and showbiz impresario S.L. Rothafel. Peet made an unconventional stage debut at the age of three, when she jumped onto the stage during a play. Yet, despite this early start, she later studied acting more as a hobby than anything else. She studied history at Columbia University, where a drama professor convinced her to audition for acting teacher Uta Hagen, with whom she later went on to study for a four-year period. During this time, she participated in the off-Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's \"Awake and Sing.\" She supported herself during the audition phase of her career by working as a waitress and with the residual checks she received from a Skittles candy commercial. Perseverance and hard work paid off, and, in 1995, she was cast in a guest-starring role on the hit series Law & Order (1990). Her feature film debut came in 1995 with the movie Animal Room (1995). For a while afterward, Amanda continued to find steady work but also found herself appearing in a depressingly large number of indie films that were never picked up for distribution. She did, however, meet her boyfriend Brian Van Holt on the set of indie movie Whipped (2000). Her turn as the ditzy hit-woman with the heart of gold in the hit comedy The Whole Nine Yards (2000), opposite Bruce Willis, took her from supporting role status to leading lady. That same year she was voted one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World by \"People\" Magazine.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3Nzk0NjgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI3NDE1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001605","name":"Amanda Peet","idIMDB":"nm0001605"},"actorId":"nm0001605","character":"Paris","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008352","main":true},{"actorName":"John Hawkes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370035","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODM2NTQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc5ODY1NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 September 1959","placeOfBirth":" Alexandria, Minnesota, USA","birthName":"John Marvin Perkins","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"John Hawkes was born John Marvin Perkins in Alexandria, Minnesota, to Patricia Jeanne (Olson) and Peter John Perkins, a farmer.

DuVall's teenage years presented her with many challenges. Her parents divorced when she was twelve, and, when her mother remarried, DuVall moved out because she did not feel at home in the newly-reconstituted family, dropping out of high school and getting her own apartment. An only child, she sought entertainment in movies and television programs, which she consumed voraciously, memorizing entire scenes from movies. Though a rather shy person, DuVall decided she wanted to be an actress, and returned to high school, this time the Los Angeles High School of the Arts. However, the rigors of independent living (she had to work to support herself) meant that she could spend little time in class, and, as a result, she fared poorly in the school. Nonetheless, DuVall had intensity, commitment and strong natural talent, and soon after graduating, the roles began to come, at first guest spots in television programs and small roles in small films. Soon her first major role came, in Robert Rodriguez's successful 1998 take on the alien-body-snatcher genre, The Faculty (1998), which featured many other up-and-coming young actors such as Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, as well as a strong cast of established adult performers. DuVall played Stokely, a bizarre, tough Goth Girl. This role was typical of DuVall's casting - the outsider, attractive though in an edgy and sometimes slightly disturbing way. (DuVall is pretty and can be glamorous, or can appear rough-around-the-edges, for a role.) Similar roles came in But I'm a Cheerleader (1999) as a tattooed lesbian and Girl, Interrupted (1999) as a mental patient. DuVall is a complex person - soft-spoken and friendly, yet tough and independent - and she ably lends this complexity to her characters, making her a popular casting choice. She continues to turn in strong performances in such productions as the ensemble thriller Identity (2003), the HBO Gen-X supernatural series La caravane de l'étrange (2003) and the critically-praised 21 Grams (2003). DuVall is a chain smoker and a close friend of director Jamie Babbit. She is no relation to veteran actors Robert Duvall or Shelley Duvall.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU0NDc3MTM4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY4Mzc1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0245112","name":"Clea DuVall","idIMDB":"nm0245112"},"actorId":"nm0245112","character":"Ginny","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0539306","main":true},{"actorName":"John C.

Well, as luck would have it, two great roles came along in two years. As Rub Squeers, Paul Newman's emotional work partner in Nobody's Fool (1994), he put in an excellent performance. However, this performance was nothing compared to the acting powerhouse which was Heavy (1995). In this tender indie film, also marking Liv Tyler's first proper film role, Vince practically carries the whole film, and does so with style. Watching him gradually lose grip of his life breaks your heart, and it is without doubt one of the most underrated performances of the 90s. Vince has not really had a film role to touch this since, but he has been in the cult hit crime show, Murder One: Diary of a Serial Killer (1997), as Clifford Banks. It was a rare opportunity for Vince to flex his acting muscles as a slightly different type of character. Vince undoubtedly has the ability to be a major star; he just needs to be given the opportunity.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NjAwNDE4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMzODQwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898546","name":"Pruitt Taylor Vince","idIMDB":"nm0898546"},"actorId":"nm0898546","character":"Malcolm Rivers","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008357","main":true},{"actorName":"Rebecca De Mornay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000360","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMjk0MzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU3ODgz._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 August 1959","placeOfBirth":" Santa Rosa, California, USA","birthName":"Rebecca Jane Pearch","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Rebecca De Mornay was born 1959 as Rebecca Jane Pearch in Santa Rosa, California. She is the daughter of Julie (Eagar) and Wally George (born George Walter Pearch), a television and radio commentator. Her paternal grandmother was child actress Eugenia Clinchard. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother married Richard De Mornay, who adopted her (Rebecca subsequently took his surname). Rebecca's paternal grandfather was English, and she also has German, French, and other English, ancestry. After Richard De Mornay's untimely death, Rebecca's mother moved her and her half-brother Peter from northern California to Europe, where she was raised primarily in England and Austria. Rebecca graduated \"summa cum laude\" from a German-speaking high school in the Austrian alps, and still speaks fluent German and French. She began her acting training in Los Angeles at Lee Strasberg's Institute, became an apprentice at Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Film Studio, and soon thereafter made her film debut in One from the Heart (1981). Her breakthrough came in the box office hit Risky Business (1983), in which she gave a seductive and critically acclaimed performance as a streetwise prostitute opposite a young Tom Cruise. She went on to international stardom with her portrayal of a chillingly twisted nanny in the hugely popular The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992). Other acclaimed film work includes Runaway Train (1985) (with Jon Voight), The Trip to Bountiful (1985) (with Geraldine Page), Backdraft (1991) (with Kurt Russell). Network television work includes the tour-de-force role of Arlie in the stellar Getting Out (1994) (based on Marsha Norman's play), the tragic title character in Dominick Dunne's An Inconvenient Woman (1991) (with Jason Robards), the remake of The Shining (1997) (produced by Stephen King), a multi-episode story arc about a cancer survivor on ER (1994) and Hallmark Hall of Fame's Night Ride Home (1999) (with Ellen Burstyn). On stage, she starred as Billie Dawn in \"Born Yesterday\" (1988) at the Pasadena Playhouse, as Charlotte Corday in \"Marat/Sade\" (1990) at the Williamstown Festival, and as Anna in \"Closer\" (2000) at the Mark Taper Forum. Rebecca's directing debut was with a segment of Showtime's Au-delà du réel - l'aventure continue (1995) starring John Savage and Frank Whaley. Rebecca currently resides in Los Angeles with sportscaster Patrick O'Neal, and their daughters, Sophia De Mornay-O'Neal and Veronica De Mornay-O'Neal.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMjk0MzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU3ODgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000360","name":"Rebecca De Mornay","idIMDB":"nm0000360"},"actorId":"nm0000360","character":"Caroline Suzanne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008355","main":true},{"actorName":"Carmen Argenziano","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0034492","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzdkZWJjNWUtODczNC00NGRhLTllN2QtMzU2N2NkZDI3OTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc3Njc5NDQ@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 October 1943","placeOfBirth":" Sharon, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Carmen Antimo Argenziano","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Carmen Argenziano was born on October 27, 1943 in Sharpsville, Pennsylvania, as Carmen Antimo Argenziano.

He was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on September 28, 1942, and had been working as a consultant, teaching senior executives how to improve their speaking skills, prior to starting an acting career relatively late in life. His connection was his wife, the veteran costume designer Milena Canonero, herself a winner of three Academy Awards and nominee for five more. He made his motion picture debut in the drama \"Birdy\", which was seen by enough people to effectively jump-start his career. One of his next few roles was one of his most infamous: the creepy Coach Schneider of \"A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge\". But the role that really got him noticed was as resistance leader George / Kuato in \"Total Recall\" (the role re-united him with Arnold Schwarzenegger, as he'd played a hit man in the comedy \"Twins\"). Other substantial film roles include a frightening homeless man terrorizing Bill Paxton in the movie \"The Vagrant\", Gordies' emotionally distant father in \"Stand By Me\", and General Owen in the movie \"Starship Troopers\", re-uniting him with \"Total Recall\" director Paul Verhoeven. He's done many TV series, including 'G vs. E', 'Wiseguy', 'The X-Files', 'Tales from the Crypt', 'Hill Street Blues', 'House', and 'Deadwood'. He's also appeared in commercials and done voice-over work. A solid, reliable actor with an authoritative presence, Bell is a natural for playing \"tough guy\" roles, although movies like \"Airheads\" show him to be able to play comedy equally well. He continues to add many credits to his resume, including the critically acclaimed \"Capote\", the prisoner of war drama \"Rescue Dawn\", and the family film \"Nancy Drew\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzODI4NzU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE2ODIwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068382","name":"Marshall Bell","idIMDB":"nm0068382"},"actorId":"nm0068382","character":"District Attorney","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Leila Kenzle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005087","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk5Nzg1NDA2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzYwMzY0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 July 1960","placeOfBirth":" Patchogue, Long Island, New York, USA","bio":"Leila Kenzle was born on July 16, 1960 in Patchogue, Long Island, New York, USA.
