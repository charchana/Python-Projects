In 1932, he joined a theatrical troupe and, before long, acted on stage in Berlin. After the war, he became a celebrated star of cabaret, an ensemble member of the 'Kabarett der Komiker'. In films from 1939, it took several years before his comic talent came to the fore. Stardom eventually arrived in the wake of Helmut Käutner's farce Fanfaren der Liebe (1951), in which the diminutive Thomalla appeared in drag as a member of a female orchestra. Thereafter, he remained consistently in demand for lightweight entertainments, which benefited from his considerable improvisational skills, quick wit and staccato delivery. His stock-in-trade screen personae were eccentric, befuddled and generally accident-prone bachelors, or out-of-their-depths fathers or husbands, who usually tended to fall victim to their own ineptitude. In addition to numerous 'Paukerfilme' and 'Klamotten' (bawdy comedies, which may, or may not, be 'old hat'), Thomalla also played his fair share of comic sidekicks or friends of the hero, a noteworthy example being Kara Ben Nemsi's loquacious, but intensely loyal manservant and companion Hadschi Halef Omar in Karl May's Die Sklavenkarawane (1958). From 1961, Thomalla devoted more and more time to appearing in television and to voice-over work. He starred in his own half-hourly TV show, Komische Geschichten mit Georg Thomalla (1961), in which he played an average Joe afflicted by middle-age angst and confronted by a variety of everyday problems. This was essentially a German derivation from the British series Hancock (1961). Though rarely seen in 'serious' roles, Thomalla did give at least one sensitive dramatic performance as a helpful truck driver in Käutner's East-West romance Sky Without Stars (1955).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0858412","name":"Georg Thomalla","idIMDB":"nm0858412"},"actorId":"nm0858412","character":"Paul","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gregor von Rezzori","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0902860","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 May 1914","placeOfBirth":" Czernowitz, Bukovina, Austria-Hungary [now Chernivtsi, Ukraine]","birthName":"Gregor d'Arezzo","bio":"Gregor von Rezzori was born on May 13, 1914 in Czernowitz, Bukovina, Austria-Hungary as Gregor d'Arezzo.

For several years, he was Germany's idea of stereotypically blithering English lords (Die seltsame Gräfin (1961), as the aptly named Lord Selwyn Moron), laconic butlers (Secret of the Red Orchid (1962)) or obtuse, clumsy second-string Scotland Yard photographers (Dead Eyes of London (1961), Front à la Scotland Yard (1962). Otherwise, Arent was patently reliable as droll, vaguely effete sidekicks and comic relief in westerns and adventure films based on the ever-popular writings of Karl May. He is fondly remembered as the mild-mannered, bumbling butterfly collector Castlepool in the 'Winnetou' trilogy, beginning with The Treasure of the Silver Lake (1962). To confound those who had him perpetually typecast, Arent also donned the black garb of villainy as a murderous monk for one of his last Edgar Wallace potboilers, The Sinister Monk (1965). He must have enjoyed this change of character, since he repeated the exercise: first (not too convincingly), playing a human trafficker masquerading as a priest in Le bossu de Londres (1966); then, as a knife-throwing killer in the English-German co-production Psycho-Circus (1966), which had the great Christopher Lee (for once) relegated to the role of the 'red herring'. Unlike most of his peers, Arent had little formal theatrical training. Instead, he began in cabaret, where he developed the character sketches and personae which would later make his name. Nor did he have any interest in forging a career on the legitimate stage. Films first saw him as a dramatic actor in minor supporting roles, his natural talent as a comedian not recognised until the end of the 1950's. After his hey-day in the 60's, his subsequent output was fairly unremarkable. For the most part, he fluttered around on the margins of youth-oriented low-brow pop-films. Some of his other pictures may have appealed to devotees of 'Heimatfilm' schmaltz. However, in the 80's, Arent acquired a new following with the television sketch show Harald und Eddi (1987). In conjunction with perennial audience favorite Harald Juhnke, he delighted audiences with his comedic versatility. Leaving the limelight in the 1990's, Arent then endured a series of financial and personal setbacks. Suffering from depression and increasingly afflicted by dementia, he died in May 2013 at the age of 88.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0034357","name":"Eddi Arent","idIMDB":"nm0034357"},"actorId":"nm0034357","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Margarete Haagen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0351776","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 November 1889","placeOfBirth":" Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany","bio":"Margarete Haagen was born on November 29, 1889 in Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany.
