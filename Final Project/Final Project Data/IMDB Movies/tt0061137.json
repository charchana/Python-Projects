This led to several small parts in movies before earning the lead role in the infamous 3D thriller Robot Monster (1953). The movie was bad but profitable, and Nader soon had a contract with Universal Pictures. Unfortunately, the studio already had on its roster such good-looking and athletic actors as Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis and Jeff Chandler, so Nader often found himself being cast in their leftovers, usually playing parts that emphasized his \"beefcake\" appeal. (At 6' 1\" and 180 pounds, Nader had the kind of physique fan magazines drooled over and unlike many of his colleagues, he frequently appeared with his chest hair intact.) However, he did enjoy a few good years in the mid-1950s, turning in a commendable performance in Away All Boats (1956) before his career began to decline. He tried his hand at three TV series and then relocated to Europe, where he enjoyed a modest revival in the late 1960s starring as \"Jerry Cotton\" in a series of West German films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4MTA0OTE1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYyNTEwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0618865","name":"George Nader","idIMDB":"nm0618865"},"actorId":"nm0618865","character":"Jerry Cotton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0093033","main":true},{"actorName":"Horst Frank","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290955","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ2YTQ5MjMtMDExMC00MTQyLTkxYTEtYmQwYmE2Y2EzZGQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 May 1929","placeOfBirth":" Lübeck [now Schleswig-Holstein], Germany","birthName":"Horst Bernhard Wilhelm Frank","bio":"The blond, steely-eyed bad guy of European westerns and potboilers was born in Lübeck, Germany, the son of a porcelain painter. Horst Frank financed his acting studies by working part-time as a babysitter and night watchman. He actually failed his final exams at the Musikhochschule Hamburg, but nonetheless managed to secure an acting position in his home town. For some time after, his work was primarily confined to small parts on stage and in radio. His first screen role saw him as a cowardly pilot in Der Stern von Afrika (1957). Frank then won a critic's award for his next role as member of a U-Boat crew in the war drama UB 55, corsaire de l'océan (1957). Of athletic, lithe build and owner of a somewhat cold, hypnotic gaze (with a voice to match), Frank soon found himself typecast to disturbingly good effect as psychotic murderers in German and international productions (The Black Panther of Ratana (1963), La jeune fille de Moorhof (1958), L'étau (1958)). Alternatively, he proved an ideal henchman for spaghetti westerns (Bullets Don't Argue (1964), Johnny Hamlet (1968) and Django, Prepare a Coffin (1968)). Frank didn't seem to mind turning out copies of the same negative in a seemingly endless gallery of ruthless killers and impassive assassins. He did so with relish well into the 1980's and 90's, enjoying guest spots on popular TV crime time shows like Tatort (1970) and Inspecteur Derrick (1974). If Horst Frank was in the cast, you knew pretty much from the start 'whodunnit'. Behind the menacing heavy, there was a family man and author of poems and chansons. In addition to his screen acting, Frank lent his voice to dubbing work (for the likes of fellow tough guys Jack Palance, Ernest Borgnine and Chuck Connors); and to radio, where he voiced Captain Nemo in \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"The Mysterious Island\". Likely because of his lack of work in major American or British productions, Frank never quite achieved the international recognition he undoubtedly deserved. He died quite suddenly in May 1999 of a brain hemorrhage, just short of his 70th birthday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ2YTQ5MjMtMDExMC00MTQyLTkxYTEtYmQwYmE2Y2EzZGQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290955","name":"Horst Frank","idIMDB":"nm0290955"},"actorId":"nm0290955","character":"Larry Link","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Heinz Weiss","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0919010","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 June 1921","placeOfBirth":" Stuttgart, Germany","bio":"Heinz Weiss was born on June 12, 1921 in Stuttgart, Germany.

One of his first voice works was dubbing Ben Johnson in Rio Grande (1950). Afterwards he spoke Rock Hudson, Paul Newman, Lex Barker, Michel Piccoli and Sean Connery in most of their movies. In some movies he was also the German voice of Clint Eastwood, Richard Harris, Kirk Douglas and Cary Grant. In addition to that he dubbed leading actors in many successful TV-Series, like William Shatner in Star Trek (1966), Patrick Macnee in The Avengers (1961) and Robert Culp in I Spy (1965). Hoffmann also worked as dialogue writer, dubbing director and talent scout (he discovered Thomas Danneberg in 1965). On screen he played minor as well as major roles and performed on stage in Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. In the 1970s he starred as Arnold Matofski in Sonderdezernat K1 (1972).
