His father is of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent, and his mother was of Irish ancestry (she converted to Judaism). It's not surprising that Ben has followed in his family's footsteps: his parents made no real effort to keep their son away from the Hollywood lifestyle and he grew up among the stars, wondering just why his parents were so popular. At a young age, he and his sister Amy Stiller would perform plays at home, wearing Amy's tights to perform Shakespeare. Ben also picked up an interest in being on the other side of the camera and, at age 10, began shooting films on his Super 8 camera. The plots were always simple: someone would pick on the shy, awkward Stiller...and then he would always get his revenge. This desire for revenge on the popular, good-looking people may have motivated his teen-angst opus Reality Bites (1994) later in his career. He both directed and performed in the film, which costarred Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke. Before he even got his start in Hollywood, Ben put in several consistently solid years in the theater. After dropping out of UCLA, he performed in the Tony Award winner, \"The House of Blue Leaves\". While working on the play, Stiller shot a short spoof of The Color of Money (1986) starring him (in the Tom Cruise role) and his American Playhouse: The House of Blue Leaves (1987) costar John Mahoney (in the Paul Newman role). The short film was so funny that Lorne Michaels purchased it and aired it on Saturday Night Live (1975). This led to Ben spending a year on the show in 1989. Ben made his big screen debut in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun (1987) in 1987. Demonstrating early on the multifaceted tone his career would take, he soon stepped behind the camera to direct Back to Brooklyn for MTV. The network was impressed and gave Stiller his own show, The Ben Stiller Show (1992). He recruited fellow offbeat comedians Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick and created a bitingly satirical show. MTV ended up passing on it, but it was picked up by Fox. Unfortunately, the show was a ratings miss. Stiller was soon out of work, although he did have the satisfaction of picking up an Emmy for the show after its cancellation. For a while, Ben had to settle for guest appearance work. While he was doing this, he saved up his cash and in the end was able to scrape enough together to make Reality Bites (1994), now a cult classic which is looked upon favorably by the generation it depicted. Ben continued to work steadily for a time, particularly in independent productions where he was more at ease. However, he never quite managed to catch a big break. His first big budget directing job was Jim Carrey's The Cable Guy (1996). Although many critics were impressed, Jim Carrey's fans were not. In 1998, There's Something About Mary (1998) had propelled Ben into the mainstream spotlight. With his wince-inducing turn in the Farrelly brothers' gross-out film, Ben really \"struck a nerve\" with mainstream America. Ben has starred in such hit movies as Keeping the Faith (2000) and Meet the Parents (2000). Ben excels at cerebral comedy, but he knows how to get down and lowbrow when he needs to, making him one of America's most popular performers.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDc3NDkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyNTQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001774","name":"Ben Stiller","idIMDB":"nm0001774"},"actorId":"nm0001774","character":"Walter Mitty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0047297","main":true},{"actorName":"Kristen Wiig","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1325419","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTA0MDA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMyMjA1NzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 August 1973","placeOfBirth":" Canandaigua, New York, USA","birthName":"Kristen Carroll Wiig","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Kristen Carroll Wiig was born on August 22, 1973 in Canandaigua, New York, to Laurie J.

Terence broke onto the scene in the Farrelly Brothers' \"Stuck on You.\" He's been seen on the small screen in such shows as \"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\", \"ER\", \" \"My Name is Earl,\" and \"Raising Hope.\" He lent his comedic skills to the YouTube sensation \"Jedi Gym\" and has been featured in a slew of national and international commercials for such iconic brands as Disneyland, Sprint, Nissan and Southwest Airlines and Direct TV.

Up next Terence will appear alongside such industry veterans as Ben Stiller and Beau Bridges in their upcoming features \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" and \"Rushlights.\" Terence was born and raised in Detroit's notoriously tough west side. At the age of 14 he was attacked by a neighborhood gang and wound up flatlining on the hospital table. Humor had its hand in his recovery and has since remained an integral part of his life. As an adult, Terence relocated to Los Angeles where he fortuitously met actor and filmmaker Benjamin Koldyke who cast him in his short \"Red Zone.\" A year later, Terence came home to a message on his answering machine from director Peter Farrelly saying he'd seen him in \"Red Zone\" and thought he'd be perfect for the movie he and his brother were doing. Terence promptly returned the call, nailed the audition and, before he knew it, found himself on set with Oscar alums Matt Damon, Greg Kinnear, Cher and Meryl Streep. He's since been seen in dozens of film and television roles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTY1OTEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM1MzIwMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385722","name":"Terence Bernie Hines","idIMDB":"nm0385722"},"actorId":"nm0385722","character":"Gary Mannheim","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Adam Scott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004395","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMjMzMDA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzcyNDY0NQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 April 1973","placeOfBirth":" Santa Cruz, California, USA","birthName":"Adam Paul Scott","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Adam Scott was born in Santa Cruz, California, the son of Anne and Douglas Scott.

Her mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and her father, Ira Owens Beaty, a professor of psychology and real estate agent, was from Virginia. Her brother, Warren Beatty, was born on March 30, 1937. Her ancestry includes English and Scottish. Shirley was the tallest in her ballet classes at the Washington School of Ballet. Just after she graduated from Washington-Lee High School, she packed her bags and headed for New York. While auditioning for Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Me and Juliet\", the producer kept mispronouncing her name. She then changed her name from Shirley MacLean Beaty to Shirley MacLaine. She later had a role in \"The Pajama Game\", as a member of the chorus and understudy to Carol Haney. A few months into the run, Shirley was going to leave the show for the lead role in \"Can-Can\" but ended up filling in for Haney, who had broken her ankle and could not perform. She would fill in for Carol, again, three months later, following another injury, the very night that movie producer Hal B. Wallis was in the audience. Wallis signed MacLaine to a five-year contract to Paramount Pictures. Three months later, she was off to shoot The Trouble with Harry (1955). She then took roles in Hot Spell (1958) and Around the World in Eighty Days (1956), completed not too long before her daughter, Sachi Parker (born Stephanie), was born. With Shirley's career on track, she played one of her most challenging roles: \"Ginny Moorhead\" in Some Came Running (1958), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She went on to do The Sheepman (1958) and The Matchmaker (1958). In 1960, she got her second Academy Award nomination for The Apartment (1960). Three years later, she received a third nomination for Irma la Douce (1963). In 1969, she brought her friend Bob Fosse from Broadway to direct her in Sweet Charity (1969), from which she got her \"signature\" song, \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\". After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made a documentary on China called The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir (1975), for which she received an Oscar nomination for best documentary. In 1977, she got her fourth Best Actress Oscar nomination for The Turning Point (1977). In 1979, she worked with Peter Sellers in Being There (1979), made shortly before his death. After 20 years in the film industry, she finally took home the Best Actress Oscar for Terms of Endearment (1983). After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made Madame Sousatzka (1988), a critical and financial hit that took top prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 1989, she starred with Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts in Steel Magnolias (1989).
