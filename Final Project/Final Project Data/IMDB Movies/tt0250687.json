His ancestry includes German, English, and Irish. He went to grade school with Drew Barrymore and attended Beverly Hills High School with Joshua John Miller and Branden Williams. It was Barrymore who introduced Breckin to her agent, after which he started doing commercials and the game show Child's Play (1982). After being accepted to California State University at Northridge, Breckin decided to put school on hold and pursue acting. He has always wanted to be a kindergarten teacher and may still do that in the future. Breckin was the drummer in the Streetwalking Cheetahs with his brother, Frank, which recorded a demo in 1995. He was the lead vocal on two songs, \"Carnival\" and \"Dave\". During 1995-1996, the band played about 10 gigs around Los Angeles. The Streetwalking Cheetahs' second album, \"Overdrive\" and their new album, \"Live on KXLU\", feature songs written when Breckin was still in the band. These songs include \"None of Your Business\", \"All I Want\", \"Peppermint\", \"Thought that Crosses My Mind\" and \"Turn Me Down\". After the Streetwalking Cheetahs, he started his own band, Bellyroom, with Seth Green and Alexander Martin, Dean Martin's grandson. They played a few gigs around Los Angeles in 1996. Breckin's friends include Ryan Phillippe, Josh Holland (USA High (1997)) and Seth Green. His best friend is Ryan Phillippe, with whom he starred in 54 (1998).

Gooding Junior","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Cuba Gooding Jr. was born on January 2, 1968, in The Bronx, New York. His mother, Shirley (Sullivan), was a backup singer for The Sweethearts. His father, Cuba Gooding, was the lead vocalist for the R&B group The Main Ingredient, which had a hit with the song \"Everybody Plays The Fool\". His paternal grandfather was from Barbados. Cuba's father moved the family to Los Angeles in 1972, only to leave them a few years later. Despite this setback, Cuba was able to maintain a positive outlook and overachieved throughout school. He attended four different high schools and was elected class president in three of them. While at high school, Cuba met and fell in love with Sara Kapfer, whom he later lived with for seven years before tying the knot in March 1994. Following high school, Cuba studied Japanese martial arts for three years before turning his focus toward acting. Early on, he landed guest starring roles on shows like Hill Street Blues (1981) and MacGyver (1985). His first major role was in the 1991 box office surprise Boyz n the Hood (1991). He followed this success with supporting roles in major films like A Few Good Men (1992), Lightning Jack (1994) and Outbreak (1995). In 1996, Cuba was cast as an arrogant but loyal football player in the Tom Cruise-Cameron Crowe film Jerry Maguire (1996). The film became a huge box office smash and earned Cuba an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His \"Show Me The Money\" line in the movie became a nationwide catchphrase. The role elevated him to superstar status, as many of Hollywood's top producers began to \"show him the money\" to appear in their films. Since Jerry Maguire (1996), Cuba has managed to keep busy with a wide range of roles alongside many of Hollywood's biggest stars. Most recently, he won critical support for his portrayal of a mentally handicapped man in the heartwarming film Radio (2003), another movie about football. In 2002, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He resides in Studio City, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMzk4NjQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzc3ODI4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000421","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr.","idIMDB":"nm0000421"},"actorId":"nm0000421","character":"Owen Templeton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010731","main":true},{"actorName":"Carrie Diamond","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1036443","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Carrie Diamond is an actress, known for Rat Race (2001).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1036443","name":"Carrie Diamond","idIMDB":"nm1036443"},"actorId":"nm1036443","character":"Casino Bartender","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Douglas Haase","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035460","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg5NDc1NDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUxNTQ4NA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Douglas Haase is an actor, known for Rat Race (2001), Daredevil (2003) and Any Given Sunday (1999).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg5NDc1NDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUxNTQ4NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035460","name":"Douglas Haase","idIMDB":"nm1035460"},"actorId":"nm1035460","character":"Guy at Bar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Myers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0616667","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 March 1959","placeOfBirth":" Miami, Florida, USA","birthName":"Christopher Patrick Myers","bio":"Chris Myers was born on March 28, 1959 in Miami, Florida, USA as Christopher Patrick Myers.

Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi's recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. She came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show as Moms Mabley. She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends were Ted Danson and Frank Langella. She was married three times and was once addicted to drugs. Goldberg first came to prominence with her starring role in The Color Purple (1985). She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies like Pie voleuse (1987), The Telephone (1988) and Jumpin' Jack Flash (1986). She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smash Ghost (1990). Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987). She admitted to being a huge fan of the original Star Trek (1966) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". Goldberg received another smash hit role in Sister Act (1992). Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and it was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, including Made in America (1993) and Soapdish (1991). Goldberg followed up to her success with Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit (1993), which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first. As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such as Eddie (1996) and The Associate (1996), and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such as The Deep End of the Ocean (1999) and How Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998). Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies include Rat Race (2001) and the quietly received Kingdom Come (2001). Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, including The Pagemaster (1994) and Captain Planet and the Planeteers (1990), as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (including Theodore Rex (1995)). Whoopi Goldberg is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had. Currently, Whoopi Goldberg is the center square in Hollywood Squares (1998) and frequently hosts the Academy Awards. She also is an author, with the book \"Book\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4ODgzNjQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzczNzc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000155","name":"Whoopi Goldberg","nicknames":["Da Whoop","Shuttlehead"],"idIMDB":"nm0000155"},"actorId":"nm0000155","character":"Vera Baker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010729","main":true},{"actorName":"Lanei Chapman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152435","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MjY2ODQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ5NTI3Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 January 1973","placeOfBirth":"","bio":"Lanei Chapman was born on January 23, 1973.
