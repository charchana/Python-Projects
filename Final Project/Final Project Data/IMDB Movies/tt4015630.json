A major, up-and-coming film star from the \"Camelot\" years straight through the turbulent era of the U.S.-Viet Nam War, he never quite reached international fame. His shining star may have suffered a power outage into the next decade, but he persevered quite well on T.V. and (especially) the stage in a career now surpassing five decades. Dullea, who was born in Cleveland, Ohio, is the son of two book-store owners, and he was raised in New York's Greenwich Village section. He graduated from George School in Pennsylvania and attended both Rutgers and San Francisco State before deciding to pursue summer stock and regional theatre. Attending the Neighborhood Playhouse, he made his New York City acting debut in a production of \"Sticks and Bones\" in 1956. His first big break came with the pilot program of the Route 66 (1960) series, and he proceeded to find other TV roles in Naked City (1958), Checkmate (1960) and various dramatic programs. Following stage work in \"Season of Choice\" (1959) and \"A Short Happy Life\" (1961), Dullea made an auspicious film debut in a leading role with The Hoodlum Priest (1961), playing a troubled street gang member who crosses paths with Don Murray's determined minister. The young actor's characters from then on seemed to walk a dangerous tight-rope of emotions, and his apparent versatility at such a young age led him to a number of other psychologically scarred portrayals. Tending to play men younger than he really was, none were more disturbed than his haphephobic adolescent David (Dullea was twenty-six at the time) in the deeply felt love story David and Lisa (1962). Paired beautifully with Janet Margolin's schizophrenic Lisa, Dullea won the Golden Globe Award for \"Most Promising Male Newcomer.\" In the World War II military drama The Thin Red Line (1964)he played an edgy, nervous-eyed private who is pushed to his murderous brink by a brutal sergeant on Guadacanal. In Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965) Dullea portrayed the incestuous brother of Carol Lynley, who may or may not figure into the disappearance of Lynley's child. Keir also costarred as the mysterious intruder who inserts an emotional wedge between gay lovers Anne Heywood and Sandy Dennis in the ground-breaking film about homosexuals, Le renard (1967). Topping that off, Dullea played the salacious Marquis De Sade himself in a relatively tame, internationally flavored production of De Sade (1969). The apex of his film career, however, came with his lead role in Stanley Kubrick's epic science-fiction film, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), as the astronaut Dr. David Bowman. In the realm of stage acting, Keir made his debut on Broadway in 1967 with \"Dr. Cook's Garden\" costarring Burl Ives, and Dullea won some \"flower power\" stardom two years later as a sensitive young blind man who attempted to wriggle free of his protective, overbearing mother. His character also pursues love with a free-spirited girl, played by Blythe Danner, in the play \"Butterflies Are Free.\" By the time the movie of this story was released in 1972 both stars had been replaced by Goldie Hawn and Edward Albert. Dullea next went abroad to seek film work in England and in Canada, but with lukewarm results. He continued to show his odd-man-out appeal on the Broadway stage as \"Brick\" in 1970, and in the Broadway revival of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" in 1974, acting along with Elizabeth Ashley as \"Maggie,\" and in the black comedy \"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead!\" one year later. In the years since then, Dullea has acted steadily on the stage in New York City, and in U.S. regional theatres, in productions of \"Sweet Prince,\" \"The Seagull\" and \"The Little Foxes,\"among others. His cinematic roles since 1970 have included another \"mysterious stranger\" in The Next One (1984), and he also reprised his \"David Bowman\" role in 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), the sequel to \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Dullea has had four wives: his first was actress Margot Bennett, and he and his third wife, Susie Fuller (whom he met during the British performances of \"Butterflies are Free\" in London), cofounded the Theater Artists Workshop of Westport in 1983. Dullea, Fuller and her two children resided in London for quite a while. After Fuller's death in 1998, Dullea married for the fourth time in 1999 to actress Mia Dillon, who is best known for portraying the character \"Babe\" in in the play, \"Crimes of the Heart\" in New York City. Just a few weeks later they appeared together in the play \"Deathtrap.\" Dullea has worked infrequently in television roles. Among his more recent work in movies has been the role of a senator in The Good Shepherd (2006), along with Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie, which was directed by Robert De Niro.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczODgxNDU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzQxOTI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001158","name":"Keir Dullea","idIMDB":"nm0001158"},"actorId":"nm0001158","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Vincent D'Onofrio","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000352","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTE2MDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUzMjcz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1959","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio was born on June 30, 1959 in Brooklyn, New York, to Phyllis, a restaurant manager and server, and Gene D'Onofrio, a theater production assistant and interior designer. He is of Italian descent and has two older sisters. He studied at the Actors Studio and the American Stanislavski Theatre. Vincent D'Onofrio is known as an \"actor's actor\". The wide variety of roles he has played and the quality of his work have earned him a reputation as a versatile talent. His first paid role was in Off-Broadway's \"This Property Is Condemned\". He continued appearing in plays and worked as a bouncer, a bodyguard and a delivery man. In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in \"Open Admissions\", followed by work in numerous other stage plays. In 2012, D'Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theater & Film Institute. As a film actor, D'Onofrio's career break came when he played a mentally unbalanced recruit in Full Metal Jacket (1987), directed by the renowned Stanley Kubrick. For this role D'Onofrio gained nearly 70 pounds. He had a major role in Dying Young (1991), and appeared prominently in the box-office smash Men in Black (1997) as the bad guy (Edgar \"The Bug\"). Other films of note in which he has appeared are Mystic Pizza (1988), JFK (1991), The Player (1992), Ed Wood (1994), The Cell (2000), The Break-Up (2006) and Jurassic World (2015). In 1996, D'Onofrio garnered critical acclaim along with co-star Renée Zellweger for The Whole Wide World (1996), which he helped produce. He also made a guest appearance in Homicide: Life on the Street: The Subway (1997), where he played an accident victim who could not be rescued and was destined to die. For this performance he won an Emmy nomination. In 2000, he both produced and starred in Steal This Movie (2000), a biopic of radical leader Abbie Hoffman. In 2001, D'Onofrio took the role which has likely given him his greatest public recognition: Det. Robert Goren, the lead character in the TV series Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001). Goren is based on Sherlock Holmes but, instead of relying upon physical evidence like Holmes, D'Onofrio's character focuses on psychology to identify the perpetrators, whom he often draws into confessing or yielding condemning evidence. He played the part for 10 years. In his career D'Onofrio's various film characters have included a priest, a bisexual former porn star, a hijacker, a serial killer, Orson Welles, a space alien, a 1960s radical leader, a pulp fiction writer, an ingenious police investigator and Stuart Smalley's dope-head brother. His on-screen love interests have included Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, Renée Zellweger, Marisa Tomei, Tracey Ullman, Rebecca De Mornay and Lili Taylor. One of his latest roles is in Marvel's Daredevil (2015) as Daredevil's nemesis, Wilson Fisk. He lives in Manhattan with his wife and children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTE2MDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUzMjcz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000352","name":"Vincent D'Onofrio","nicknames":["The Human Chameleon","Noffy"],"idIMDB":"nm0000352"},"actorId":"nm0000352","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Steven Spielberg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjAzNzE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTk0ODc0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 December 1946","placeOfBirth":" Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Steven Allan Spielberg","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Undoubtedly one of the most influential film personalities in the history of film, Steven Spielberg is perhaps Hollywood's best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. Spielberg has countless big-grossing, critically acclaimed credits to his name, as producer, director and writer. Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western Wagon Train (1957). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin' (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin' also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Duel (1971), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling's Night Gallery (1969), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969) and Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world. Spielberg's first major directorial effort was The Sugarland Express (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: Jaws (1975). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), and followed that effort with Used Cars (1980), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt Russell\\\\Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was Poltergeist (1982), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reece's Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\" and \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up \"Raiders\" with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as The Goonies (1985), and was the brains behind the little monsters in Gremlins (1984). He also produced the cartoon An American Tail (1986), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster Back to the Future (1985), which made Michael J. Fox an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book The Color Purple (1985), with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed Empire of the Sun (1987), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though. The late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed Always (1989) as well as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and Back to the Future Part II (1989). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Dad (1989), with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson, which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series Tiny Toon Adventures (1990), Animaniacs (1993), Pinky and the Brain (1995), Freakazoid! (1995), Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain (1998), Family Dog (1993) and Toonsylvania (1998). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as The Land Before Time (1988), We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993), Casper (1995) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of The Flintstones (1994), where he was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed Hook (1991) and produced such films as the cute fantasy Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller Arachnophobia (1990), Back to the Future Part III (1990) and Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed Jurassic Park (1993), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed Schindler's List (1993), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes. As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as The Mask of Zorro (1998), Men in Black (1997) and Deep Impact (1998). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic Amistad (1997), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: Saving Private Ryan (1998), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Shakespeare in Love (1998). Spielberg produced a series of films, including Evolution (2001), Hantise (1999) and Shrek (2001). he also produced two sequels to Jurassic Park (1993), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: Band of Brothers (2001), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director's chair for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics. Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series SeaQuest 2032 (1993), an anthology series entitled Amazing Stories (1985), created the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of ER (1994). Spielberg, if you haven't noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called Eyes of the Holocaust (2000). With all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjAzNzE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTk0ODc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229","name":"Steven Spielberg","idIMDB":"nm0000229"},"actorId":"nm0000229","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James B.

A budding jazz musician as well, he skipped college in favor of a move east to New York to study acting. Once there, he began performing with the Ark Theatre Company as both an actor and musician. Field subsequently won a role in Woody Allen's nostalgic Radio Days (1987). Then had an independent Spirit Award-nominated turn in'Victor Nunez (I)''s Sundance Film Festival Grand jury Prize-winner Ruby in Paradise (1993). He also starred in Nicole Holofcener's_Walking and Talking (1996)_ which won the Grand Special Prize at the Deauville Film Festival. Other credits include Scott Ziehl's_Broken Vessels (1998)_ in which Field starred and produced, and'Stanley Kubrick''s final masterpiece, Eyes Wide Shut (1999) in which he played the mysterious \"Nick Nightingale\". In 1999, Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Field has a deceptive facade of all-American clean-cut looks that allows him to suggest a wide range of emotions and thoughts behind such a regular-guy appearance; in \"Ruby in Paradise\" he expressed such uncommon decency and intelligence you had to wonder how Ashley Judd's hardscrabble Ruby could ever have considered letting him get away. In \"Eyes Wide Shut\" he's the likable med school dropout turned saloon piano player, and in Broken Vessels he's an increasingly raging sociopath. In all these roles Field has the precious gift of being able to surprise you and to command your attention on screen.\" However, it was precisely at this point in his career that Field decided to leave acting behind and try instead to make a name for himself as a writer/director. His first film When I Was a Boy (1993) was selected by the Film Society of Lincoln Center as part of their New Directors/New Films series and was shown at the Museum of Modern Art. His next film, Nonnie & Alex (1995) received both the Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival and the Best Film prize at the Aspen Film Festival. The film was honored with a special citation from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Field was honored with the Franklin J. Schaffner Award for Excellence from the AFI, one of the highest honors the institute ever bestows upon a filmmaker. In 2001, Field made his feature writing/directing debut with In the Bedroom (2001), an intensely emotional portrayal of the repercussions of family tragedy on a New England couple. The film received five Academy Award nominations, three Golden Globe nominations, and Field was named both Screenwriter and Director of the year by the National Board of Review. Internationally acclaimed by critics, the film was named Best Picture of the Year by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, New York Magazine, The New York Observer, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. In 2006, Field co-wrote and directed Little Children (2006). The film, starring Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, won numerous awards from the nation's top critics associations including writing awards for Field and Perrotta. The movie received three Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture of the Year, and was nominated for three Academy Awards.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1ODI1MzI3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0276062","name":"Todd Field","idIMDB":"nm0276062"},"actorId":"nm0276062","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt4015630","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4015630","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 24 min (84 min)"],"soundMix":["Stereo"],"color":["Color (Black & White and Color)"],"aspectRatio":["1.78 : 1 / (high definition)"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.5","filmingLocations":[{"location":"London, England, UK"}],"awards":[],"votes":"69","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0160228","name":"Light Source & Imagery"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:42:23"}}
