A native of New York City, Holt often claimed to have been born in Winchester, Virginia, where he grew up. The son of an Episcopal minister, he attended Trinity School in Manhattan, then the Virginia Military Institute, from which he was expelled for bad behavior. Giving up his vague hopes of becoming a lawyer, he went on the road, engaging in numerous occupations. He mined gold in Alaska, worked as both a railroad and a civil engineer, delivered mail, rode herd on cattle, and played parts in traveling stage productions. While looking for work as a surveyor in San Francisco in 1914, he volunteered to ride a horse over a cliff in a stunt for a film crew shooting in San Rafael. In gratitude, the director gave him a part in the film. Holt followed the movie people to Hollywood and began getting bits and stunt jobs in the many Westerns and serials being made there. He impressed a number of co-workers at Universal Pictures, among them Francis Ford and his brother John Ford, and Grace Cunard. Holt soon became a frequent supporting player in their films, and then a star in serials. A move to Paramount studios in 1917 cemented his leading man status, and he became one of the studio's great stars, particularly in a very successful series of Westerns based on the novels of Zane Grey. Talkies proved no problem for Holt, and his career thrived, although mostly in run-of-the-mill adventure films. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Holt entered the U.S. Army at the age of 54, serving at the request of General George C. Marshall as a horse buyer for the cavalry. Upon his return to pictures following the war, he alternated between character roles in major films such as John Ford's They Were Expendable (1945) and leading roles in minor Westerns. He made a cameo appearance in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) which starred his son Tim Holt. That same year father and son played father and son in a B-Western, The Arizona Ranger (1948). Less than three years later, on January 18, 1951, Holt died of a heart attack at the Los Angeles Veterans Hospital in Sawtelle, a couple of blocks west of the Los Angeles National Cemetery where he is now buried.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0OTIyNDU1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMTQ5Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0392442","name":"Jack Holt","idIMDB":"nm0392442"},"actorId":"nm0392442","character":"Bent Wade","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Betty Jewel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0422408","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5MTQ1N2EtNGFlNC00MDEyLWJjY2MtNTM5NjU2ZmYwNTZkL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 April 1899","placeOfBirth":" Omaha, Nebraska, USA","birthName":"Julia Baroni","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Betty Jewel was born on April 29, 1899 in Omaha, Nebraska, USA as Julia Baroni.

Davis given name was 'David Bryce Thomson.\" Born on Jan 17,1863 in Edinbough,Scotland. David's brother was character star 'Ernest Torrence' who was 15 years younger than David. Ernest was the first of the two to come to California and become actors. Educated in both England and Germany, David moved with equal ease from stage to screen in the early part of the 20th century. Following the completion of the classic silent films Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1913) with the legendary stage actress Minnie Maddern Fiske, and The Prisoner of Zenda (1913), however, David returned to focus on Broadway plays and enjoy life on a Mexican ranch. A steep reversal of fortunes aggravated a necessary return to Hollywood following World War I, and, fortunately for his fans, he stayed for nearly two decades. Playing a number of leads during his silent heyday, many of them men of influence, his portrayals of stern-faced villains may not have rivaled that of brother Ernest, but David made for quite a contemptible gent in a few. In his first sound picture, the historical drama Disraeli (1929), he played an austere-looking anti-Semitic head of the Bank of England whose refusal to finance the Suez canal results in action taken by Prime Minister Disraeli, played by George Arliss. David also went on to lend Arliss prime support in the comedy drama A Successful Calamity (1932), and in another biopic history lesson, Voltaire (1933). Come the advent of sound, his characters continued to prestigious characters (bankers, merchants, lawyers, and attorneys), but grew smaller in size until he faded out in unbilled parts, such as in The Dark Angel (1935) and Lost Horizon (1937). Comedy fans might remember David for his performance as Scots attorney Mr. Miggs in the Laurel and Hardy feature Bonnie Scotland (1935). His last roles included, Rulers of the Sea (1939) and Stanley and Livingstone (1939). David Torrence died Dec 26,1951 Beverly Hills, Ca. and is buried at the Inglewood Cemetery while others give 1951.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM3ZGU2ZGEtODJjZS00MzBhLTljYzItYmVjMDlhMGZlMzAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868456","name":"David Torrence","idIMDB":"nm0868456"},"actorId":"nm0868456","character":"Mark King","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tom Kennedy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448366","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk0OTk2ZjctNTdiZi00OGZjLWFhYWUtMDgzYjQ0ZWQ2Y2ViL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 July 1885","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"Once a boxer, brawny character actor Tom Kennedy began his film career early in the silent era.

Hoyt joined the acting fraternity through the recommendations of an uncle, who worked as dramatic editor for a Cleveland tabloid. Signed by theatrical producer George C. Tyler (1868-1946), he began on stage (earning $10 per week), playing up to ten different parts. He made his Hollywood debut in 1916 with Universal. Short, balding and usually bespectacled, he managed to forge a 30-year career by playing a succession of 'little men', be they mild-mannered professors, henpecked husbands or easily intimidated minor officials. Looking perpetually befuddled was Hoyt's stock-in-trade. He was particularly effective as Professor Summerlee in The Lost World (1925) (directed by his younger brother Harry O. Hoyt), as the confused motel owner of It Happened One Night (1934) and as Mayor Tillinghast in The Great McGinty (1940). The better part of Hoyt's screen career, however, consisted of uncredited bits. For his last seven years in the business (1940-47), he was regularly employed as a member of Preston Sturges personal entourage of stock players at Paramount.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398446","name":"Arthur Hoyt","idIMDB":"nm0398446"},"actorId":"nm0398446","character":"King's Secretary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0018185","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018185","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 5 min (65 min)"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["1,815.69 m (6 reels) (USA)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0047533","name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["based on novel"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 07:33:00"}}
