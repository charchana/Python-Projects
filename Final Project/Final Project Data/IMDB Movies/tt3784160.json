And up on the walls, generation after generation has pushed the limits of climbing, vying amongst each other for supremacy on Yosemite's cliffs. \"Valley Uprising\" is the riveting, unforgettable tale of this bold rock climbing tradition in Yosemite National Park: half a century of struggle against the laws of gravity -- and the laws of the land.","simplePlot":"In the shady campgrounds of Yosemite valley, climbers carved out a counterculture lifestyle of dumpster-diving and wild parties that clashed with the conservative values of the National ...

He is a graduate of St. Louis' Washington University, where he majored in history and literature. He was a co-founder of the comedy improvisational group Mama's Pot Roast and trained initially with the Actors' Studio in New York. Such off-Broadway productions included Horton Foote's \"Laura Dennis\" and John Cameron Mitchell's \"Kingdom of Earth.\" He made his screen debut in Tim Robbins' Dead Man Walking (1995) and was given more sizable roles in Desert Blue (1998) and The Man in the Iron Mask (1998), as the ill-fated son of the Musketeer Athos, played by John Malkovich. Peter then started gracing the art-house circuit, making a violent, searing impression as a homophobic killer in Boys Don't Cry (1999) starring two-time Oscar-winner Hilary Swank as a trans-gendered teen. Other impressionable offbeat roles for Peter that have thrilled critics from coast to coast include Shattered Glass (2003), which earned him a slew of awards including the prestigious National Society of Film Critics Award. Prior to that, he showed off his versatility with portrayals ranging from a Russian nuclear reactor officer in K-19: The Widowmaker (2002) to a drug addict in The Salton Sea (2002). Other heralded performances in Garden State (2004) and Kinsey (2004) only prove that, at this rate, it is only a matter of time before the Oscars come rapping on Sarsgaard's door.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0Mjg0NzE2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE1MTkxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0765597","name":"Peter Sarsgaard","idIMDB":"nm0765597"},"actorId":"nm0765597","character":"Narrator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alex Honnold","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3658958","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Alex Honnold is known for his work on Valley Uprising (2014), A Better Life: An Exploration of Joy & Meaning in a World Without God (2015) and Progression (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3658958","name":"Alex Honnold","idIMDB":"nm3658958"},"actorId":"nm3658958","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yvon Chouinard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3171359","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Yvon Chouinard is known for his work on 180° South (2010), Valley Uprising (2014) and DamNation (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3171359","name":"Yvon Chouinard","idIMDB":"nm3171359"},"actorId":"nm3171359","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Royal Robbins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3829969","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 February 1935","placeOfBirth":" Point Pleasant, West Virginia, USA","bio":"Royal Robbins was born on February 3, 1935 in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, USA.

By 1980 she gained notice for a first ascent on a 5.12c climb near Telluride. In 1990 she became the first woman to climb 5.14. By then she had been on the competitive World Cup circuit for five years, which she continued to do until burning out in 1992. She's won more matches than she can remember--two dozen, maybe 30. What stunned the climbing world (although if anyone could do it, Hill could) was her success in freeing The Nose in 1993 over the course of four days, finishing a project no one else had managed in 30 years. To \"free\" a route you must climb only the rock, and only with your hands and feet. Although Hill could rest at relay stations and had a climbing partner to catch her when she fell, she led every pitch and managed to climb sections that previously had been ascended only with \"aid\" - that is, by hanging and climbing on equipment placed in the rock. She went back in '94 and did the same route, free, in 23 hours. Last year, on a North Face expedition to remote Kyrgyzstan, she and Alex Lowe free-climbed two huge walls known as The Bird and The Bastille. (Lowe is featured in a current North Face print advertisement, standing next to a yellow tent pitched on a tiny piece of snow at the top of The Bird, and Hill is pictured in another ad showing the same peak.)","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1036562","name":"Lynn Hill","idIMDB":"nm1036562"},"actorId":"nm1036562","character":"Herself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dean Potter","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2552345","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"Dean Spalding Potter","height":"6' 5\" (1.96 m)","bio":"Dean Potter was born as Dean Spalding Potter.
