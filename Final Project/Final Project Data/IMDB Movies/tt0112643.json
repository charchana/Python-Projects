He grew up in Lompoc, California with a plethora of siblings both older and younger. He attended the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts in Santa Maria, and the Professional Actor's Training Program at the University of Washington in Seattle. He spent about four years in regional theater performing at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, the Arizona Theatre Company in Tucson, the California Shakespearean Festival, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa among others. In 1980 he moved to Los Angeles, where he lives with his family. As a horror film leading actor, Combs is probably best known for portraying Herbert West in the cult horror film Re-Animator (1985). Re-Animator was based on H.P. Lovecraft's famous novel brought together by Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, the producer and financier of the film. Combs stayed in the realm of cult films with both Gordon and Yuzna to return when making From Beyond (1986), and Bride of Re-Animator (1989) also from Lovecraft novels. He has also been in some supporting roles in _Pit and the Pendulum, The (1990) (V)_, the strange FBI Agent with Michael J. Fox in Fantômes contre fantômes (1996), I Still Know What You Did Last Summer (1998) and the remake of the William Castle thriller, House on Haunted Hill (1999).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3Njg1NDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk4Nzg5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001062","name":"Jeffrey Combs","idIMDB":"nm0001062"},"actorId":"nm0001062","character":"John Reilly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0175061","main":true},{"actorName":"Barbara Crampton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186225","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY2NzMzNDY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzY5MTAyMDI@._V1_UY44_CR10,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 December 1958","placeOfBirth":" Levittown, Long Island, New York, USA","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Gorgeous, talented and charismatic blonde actress Barbara Crampton was born on December 27, 1958 in Levittown, Long Island, New York and raised in Vermont. Because her father was a carnie, Barbara spent her childhood summers traveling the country with the carnival. Crampton first began acting in school plays in 7th grade and studied acting in high school. She earned a BA in Theater Arts from Castleton State College. Following graduation, Crampton portrayed \"Cordelia\" in an American Theater of Actors production of \"King Lear\" in New York. Barbara then moved to Los Angeles and made her TV debut with a recurring role on the popular daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives (1965). She had a brief, but memorable role as Craig Wasson's unfaithful girlfriend, \"Carol\", in Brian De Palma's Body Double (1984) and was funny as the bubble-headed \"Chrissie\" in the crudely amusing comedy, Fraternity Vacation (1985). Barbara achieved her greatest enduring cult popularity as sweet college coed \"Megan Halsey\" in Stuart Gordon's terrific Re-Animator (1985). She gave an excellent performance as the ambitious, but prim and repressed \"Dr. Katherine McMichaels\" in the equally fine From Beyond (1986). Crampton was quite engaging as the perky \"Suzie Lynn\" in the fun Chopping Mall (1986) and typically solid as the unhappy \"Susan Reilly\" in Castle Freak (1995). Barbara had recurring roles on the daytime television soap operas Guiding Light (1952), The Young and the Restless (1973) (Crampton won a Soap Opera Digest Award for her acting on this show) and Amour, gloire et beauté (1987). Among the TV shows Crampton has done guest spots on are The Nanny (1993), Pacific Blue (1996), Party of Five (1994), Hotel (1983) and Santa Barbara (1984). Her hobbies include skiing, yoga, horseback riding, running, working out with weights and shopping for antiques at flea markets. Barbara Crampton lives right outside of San Francisco with her husband, Robert Bleckman, and their two children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY2NzMzNDY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzY5MTAyMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186225","name":"Barbara Crampton","idIMDB":"nm0186225"},"actorId":"nm0186225","character":"Susan Reilly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0175062","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Fuller","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0298268","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Nzc2MzI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzAyMzg2MjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Jonathan Fuller is a native of Birmingham, Alabama and one of the first alumnus from the Alabama School of Fine Arts.
