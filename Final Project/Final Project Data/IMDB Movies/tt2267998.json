His mother, Chris Anne (née Boldt), is a school teacher, and his father, Timothy Byers Affleck, is a social worker; the two are divorced. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, \"Géza\", is after a family friend. Affleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including Hands of a Stranger (1987) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Dazed and Confused (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1997) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Good Will Hunting (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Good Will Hunting (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly. Affleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Changing Lanes (2002), The Sum of All Fears (2002), and Daredevil (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Gigli (2003) and Surviving Christmas (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Smokin' Aces (2006), He's Just Not That Into You (2009), State of Play (2009), and Extract (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Gone Baby Gone (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win). In 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Gone Girl (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), briefly reprised the character in Suicide Squad (2016), and will do so again in Justice League (2017), and other sequels. Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in 2005. The couple has three children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MzIxMTk0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU5NjA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255","name":"Ben Affleck","idIMDB":"nm0000255"},"actorId":"nm0000255","character":"Nick Dunne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0397488","main":true},{"actorName":"Rosamund Pike","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0683253","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MjIxMzA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwNzU0NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 January 1979","placeOfBirth":" Hammersmith, London, England, UK","birthName":"Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Pike","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Born on January 27, 1979 in London, England, actress Rosamund Mary Elizabeth Pike is the only child of a classical violinist mother, Caroline (Friend), and an opera singer father, Julian Pike.

His parents, Sheila Gail (Scott) and Ronald Gene Harris, were lawyers and ran a restaurant. He grew up in Ruidoso, New Mexico, a small town 120 miles south of Albuquerque, where he first took up acting in the fourth grade. While tagging along with his older brother of 3 years, Harris won the part of Toto in a school production of The Wizard of Oz (1939). His parents moved the family to Albuquerque in 1988, the same year that Harris made his film debut in two movies: Purple People Eater (1988) and Clara's Heart (1988), which starred Whoopi Goldberg. A year later, when Neil was 16, he landed the lead role in Steven Bochco's television series about a teen prodigy doctor at a local hospital, Doogie Howser, M.D. (1989), which launched Harris into teen-heartthrob status. The series lasted1989-1993 and earned him a People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Series (1990) and a Golden Globe Nomination (1990). Harris attended the same high school as Freddie Prinze Jr., La Cueva High School in Albuquerque. Neil acted on stage in a few plays while there, one of which was his senior play, Fiddler on the Roof (1971), in which he portrayed Lazar Wolf the butcher (1991). When \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" stopped production in 1993, Harris took up stage acting, which he had always wanted to do. After a string of made-for-television movies, Harris acted in his first big screen roles in nine years, Starship Troopers (1997) with Casper Van Dien and then The Proposition (1998). In July 1997, Harris accepted the role of Mark Cohen for the Los Angeles production of the beloved musical, Rent (2005). His performance in \"Rent\" garnered him a Drama-League Award in 1997. He continued in the musical, to rave reviews, until January 1998. He later reprised the role for six nights in his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in December 1998. In 1999, Harris returned to television in the short-lived sitcom Stark Raving Mad (1999), with Tony Shalhoub. He was also in the big-screen projects The Next Best Thing (2000) and Undercover Brother (2002), and he can be heard as the voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the newest animated Spider-Man (2003) series. Harris has continued his stage work, making his Broadway debut in 2001 in \"Proof.\" He has also appeared on stage in \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Cabaret,\" Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in Concert (2001), and, most recently, \"Assassins.\" In 2005, Harris returned to the small screen in a guest-starring role on Numb3rs (2005) and a starring role in the sitcom How I Met Your Mother (2005).

In 1991, he was working an office job, when he saw an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show (1986) discussing the therapeutic nature of writing. This inspired him to begin writing and he worked through his bad experiences by writing letters to himself. He adapted his letters into a play, \"I Know I've Changed\", about domestic abuse. Unfortunately, after renting a theater in Atlanta to put on the play, he failed to attract audiences. He took on a series of odd jobs and found himself living in his car. But, in 1998, he was given a second chance to stage his play and, this time, he was more business-savvy with his marketing. The play was sold-out and drew attention from investors.

Everyone's favorite \"Sister\" was born Sela Ann Ward, on July 11, 1956, in Meridian, Mississippi. Sela's parents were Annie Kate (Boswell) and Granberry Holland Ward, Jr., an electrical engineer; the three younger children in the family are Jenna (1957), Berry (1959) and Brock (1961). \"Sela\" is a Hebrew word that means \"rock, boulder, cliff.\" Sela graduated from the University of Alabama in 1977, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in art and advertising; Sela was also a cheerleader for the Crimson Tide football team, a Homecoming Queen and a member of the Chi Omega sorority. Sela moved to New York to work for an advertising agency. Responding to a friend's suggestion that she was tall (5'7\") and pretty enough to try modeling, Sela began a highly successful career with the Wilhelmina Agency. Sela's first gig was in the Pepsi advertising department, and her first commercial was for Maybelline. After appearing in 20 national TV commercials, Sela moved to L.A. and got her first TV role in Emerald Point N.A.S. (1983); she dated tall costar Richard Dean Anderson for 3 years (which is much longer than the TV series lasted). Sela's movie break came by appearing with Burt Reynolds in the film The Man Who Loved Women (1983), and by now her acting career was established. But perhaps Sela is best known for starring in the TV series Sisters (1991), which ran for 6 seasons. The series was a big hit with women, and if the males in the audience stuck around after the steamy (literally) opening sauna sequence, they too would discover a series with fascinating writing and story plots, with Sela as \"Teddy\"-- in the fashion industry she began her first company, which she wanted to call Teddy Wear. In 1992 and 1994, Sela got the Golden Globe nomination for best lead actress in a drama series; in 1994, she won an Emmy Award and, in 1996, the Screen Actors Guild Award. During the series' run, Sela married Howard Sherman (May 23, 1992 - present). They had two children: Austin Ward (May 13, 1994), Anabella Raye (May 30, 1998). Still very much a pretty woman, Sela appeared in Runaway Bride (1999) as Pretty Bar Woman. In 2000, Sela won her 2nd Emmy award, this time for work in Once and Again (1999).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4NjYzNDAwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzMwMjA2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000688","name":"Sela Ward","idIMDB":"nm0000688"},"actorId":"nm0000688","character":"Sharon Schieber","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0478384","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2267998","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2267998","business":{"budget":{"money":"$61,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$37,513,109","country":"USA","day":"05","month":"10","year":"2014","remarks":"3,014 Screens"},{"money":"HUF 39,167,770","country":"Hungary","day":"05","month":"10","year":"2014","remarks":""},{"money":"$3,202,261","country":"Russia","day":"05","month":"10","year":"2014","remarks":"1,049 Screens"}],"gross":[{"money":"$167,735,396","country":"USA","day":"08","month":"02","year":"2015","remarks":""},{"money":"$167,590,676","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"01","year":"2015","remarks":""},{"money":"$37,513,109","country":"USA","day":"05","month":"10","year":"2014","remarks":""},{"money":"$338,819,589","country":"Worldwide","day":"12","month":"12","year":"2014","remarks":""},{"money":"$843,673","country":"Portugal","day":"12","month":"12","year":"2014","remarks":""},{"money":"€4,206,655","country":"Spain","day":"02","month":"11","year":"2014","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":[{"money":"$33,073","country":"USA","day":"08","month":"02","year":"2015","remarks":"73 Screens"},{"money":"$99,617","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"01","year":"2015","remarks":"145 Screens"},{"money":"$37,513,109","country":"USA","day":"05","month":"10","year":"2014","remarks":"3,014 Screens"}],"admissions":[{"money":"294,924","country":"Netherlands","day":"31","month":"12","year":"2014","remarks":""}],"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[null,null],"copyrightHolder":"Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Regency Entertainment (USA), Inc. and TSG Entertainment Finance LLC in the U.S. only;
