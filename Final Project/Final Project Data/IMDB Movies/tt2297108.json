Moving between 14 different schools from California to Hawaii, ending in Las Vegas, Tony was always the new kid in school. Due to the need to continually introduce himself, Tony naturally became an outgoing and witty person, which consistently put him in the center of attention. Whether animatedly reenacting a story about a past school to his friends in the cafeteria, or impeccably drifting inches between light poles and cars before e-braking into his spot in the parking lot; when you met Tony, you were not likely to forget him. Tony loved engaging people into his stories and plots, and later realized he had a natural talent for stage, which was for him like telling a story in the cafeteria. However, despite the natural talent of this young man, his aspirations to pursue his passion of acting were hindered by the upheavals of an inconsistent place to call \"home.\" Entering his freshman year of high school, Tony took a stand against his inconsistencies, and enrolled in acting classes to focus on his passion. This however was a short lived commitment, as Tony was forced to move to Las Vegas during his senior year of high school, unwillingly removing him from his acting classes and training. Once in Las Vegas, and starting to \"grow-up,\" Tony embodied the entrepreneurial and independent spirit he had grown up around in his family, and moved out of his loving parent's house at age 17. Tony began his \"professional life\" managing multiple cell phone accessory stores, until he purchased the company for himself, all before he was 20. With his life following the familiar successful path of his business savvy father, Tony realized he was successful, however not passionate about his work; as his passion was still pursuing a career in acting and that dream was slipping away. So, in 2005 Tony sold his company, packed his life up and moved to Hollywood. It took a few trials in Los Angeles before he made a final and permanent plunge into Hollywood when his hard work began to bring to fruition his dreams. Since being in Hollywood, Tony studied at Howard Fine, completed Improvisation at Groundings, and studied stunts at XMA World Headquarters. His natural talents and desire to learn brought in a fairly consistent string of work including parts in Spiderman 3, episodes on Entourage and Nip/Tuck and several smaller appearances. Still a new actor to Hollywood he still finds himself with streaks of down time in Hollywood, where he enjoys taking those times to engage in classes, international opportunities, as well as returning back \"home\" to Las Vegas to try and capture some luck, and bring it back to California with him.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTIwMTIyODk2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM0MzQ0NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2283025","name":"Tony Besson","nicknames":["Hollywood","Ynot"],"idIMDB":"nm2283025"},"actorId":"nm2283025","character":"Dave","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hayley Derryberry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3082812","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTAzOTEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM3MDAwMTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Hayley Derryberry is known for her work on Frank (2014), Rabid Love (2013) and Making Time (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTAzOTEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM3MDAwMTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3082812","name":"Hayley Derryberry","idIMDB":"nm3082812"},"actorId":"nm3082812","character":"Sarah","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chance Harlem Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3091288","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Chance Harlem Jr. is known for his work on Charlene (2014), Cat (2016) and Unlawful Justice (2017).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3091288","name":"Chance Harlem Jr.","idIMDB":"nm3091288"},"actorId":"nm3091288","character":"Earl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mike Holley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1658924","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NDg3MzM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE3MDc5NjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Mike Holley is known for his work on Angie Tribeca (2016), Miss Stevens (2016) and Grey's Anatomy (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NDg3MzM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE3MDc5NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1658924","name":"Mike Holley","idIMDB":"nm1658924"},"actorId":"nm1658924","character":"Mike","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jennifer Robyn Jacobs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4166408","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EzNTFjZDEtODM3Yy00Nzg3LTg1NjUtYzQ0NGEzOThkN2I0L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA5ODUwMDQ@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 3½\" (1.61 m)","bio":"Jennifer Robyn Jacobs is a Los Angeles based actress.
