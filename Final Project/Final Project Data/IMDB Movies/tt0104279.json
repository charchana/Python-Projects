He also benefited from the Federal Theatre Project, funded by the Works Progress Administration after the onset of the Great Depression. During World War II, Dan helped entertain troops as a member of the U.S. Army Special Services, subsequently making his first appearance on Broadway as a marine in 'Christopher Blake'. He began acting on the small screen during the 1950's, appearing in anything from anthology series, to comedies, to crime drama. His motion picture debut did not eventuate until 1963, when he portrayed a priest in Lilies of the Field (1963). For the best part of his screen career, Dan portrayed an assortment of clergymen and cops, almost invariably honest, hard-working types. Internationally, he became best known as Telly Savalas's nervous NYPD boss, Captain Frank McNeil, during all five seasons of Kojak (1973); and as Virgil Starkwell's (Woody Allen's) psychiatrist in the hilarious Take the Money and Run (1969). Dan Frazer was a Member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNDM4NTI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ3Nzg3MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0292498","name":"Dan Frazer","idIMDB":"nm0292498"},"actorId":"nm0292498","character":"President","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Reathel Bean","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0063804","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 August 1942","placeOfBirth":" Missouri, USA","bio":"Reathel Bean was born on August 24, 1942 in Missouri, USA.
