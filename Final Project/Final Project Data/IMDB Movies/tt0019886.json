Samaniego Siqueiros, a prosperous dentist. Ramon and his family moved to Los Angeles in 1913, as refugees from the Mexican Revolution. After stints as a ballet dancer, piano teacher and singing waiter, he became a film extra in 1917. For five years he remained an extra until director Rex Ingram cast him as Rupert in The Prisoner of Zenda (1922). He was cast with Lewis Stone and Ingram's wife, Alice Terry (Ingram was also the person who suggested that he change his name to Novarro). He worked with Ingram in his next four films and was again teamed with Terry in the successful Scaramouche (1923). Novarro's rising popularity among female moviegoers resulted in his being billed as the \"New Valentino\". In 1925 he appeared in his most famous role, as the title character in Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925), and later co-starred with Norma Shearer in The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1927). His first talking picture was Call of the Flesh (1930), where he sang and danced the tango. He continued to appear in musicals, but his popularity was slipping. He starred with Greta Garbo in the successful Mata Hari (1931), but his career began to fade fast. In 1935 he left MGM and appeared on Broadway in a show that quickly flopped. His later career, when he was able to find work in films, consisted mostly of cameos. On October 30th, 1968, Ramon Novarro was savagely beaten in his North Hollywood home by two young hustlers. They had heard - in error - that he had thousands of dollars locked away somewhere in his home. They never found any money, and Ramon was discovered dead the next day by his servant.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1OTc5MTAwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzEwNTQ2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003895","name":"Ramon Novarro","nicknames":["The Latin Lover"],"idIMDB":"nm0003895"},"actorId":"nm0003895","character":"Tommy Winslow","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0498834","main":true},{"actorName":"Ralph Graves","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0336339","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRhMzZlMjEtMmQzOC00MGZiLTkxM2EtZWMwMTdmY2JjMDA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 January 1900","placeOfBirth":" Cleveland, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Ralph Horsburgh","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Ralph Graves was born on January 23, 1900 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA as Ralph Horsburgh.

She was best known for starring in The Broadway Melody (1929), the first sound film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Her leading men included the likes of John Gilbert, Clark Gable, Buster Keaton and Robert Montgomery. Only in her late teens when stardom beckoned, Anita had a huge following that earned her record amounts of fan mail, but she was seldom given lead roles, most often playing second lead, perhaps due to her youthful inexperience as an actress. She was a charming, much-loved screen personality but by 1932 MGM seemed to lose interest in her career despite impressive work in such films as Night Court (1932) and Skyscraper Souls (1932), and before the year was out her contract was not renewed; she slipped off into \"B\" stardom in films at Columbia, Universal and even more minor studios. She retired from the screen in 1936, making a return 25 years later in The Runaway (1961) with Cesar Romero, and she lived quietly out of the limelight for over a half century. In the 1990s the now widowed star was rediscovered by the media, which enjoyed her light-humored journeys down memory lane about her career, MGM, the silent and early talkie eras and the stars she knew, earning the actress a devoted cult of young fans and a few brief appearances in ultra-low-budget films of the 1990s.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDIxODc1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjAyMjI2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0656105","name":"Anita Page","nicknames":["The Girl With the Most Beautiful Face in Hollywood"],"idIMDB":"nm0656105"},"actorId":"nm0656105","character":"Anita Hastings","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0019886","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019886","business":{"budget":{"money":"$385,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":"Copyright MCMXXIX in U.S.A. by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (on print); Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures; 16 January 1929; LP37 (in copyright registry)"},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 40 min (100 min)","1 hr 27 min (87 min) (Turner library print) (USA)"],"soundMix":["Mono (MovieTone) (musical score and sound effects)","Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["2,756.61 m (11 reels)"],"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.7","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Hotel del Coronado - 1500 Orange Avenue, Coronado, California, USA"}],"rated":"PASSED","awards":[],"votes":"200","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0016037","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["united states naval academy","swimming","suicide","seaplane","san diego california","romantic rivalry","rescue","rainstorm","radio operator","practical joke","airplane crash","physical examination","pensacola florida","pacific ocean","navigator","mother daughter relationship","midshipmen","hotel","hospital","honolulu hawaii","graduation","friendship","flare","fire","expulsion","drunkenness","doctor","crash injury","bridge card game","beach","aviator","aviation","annapolis maryland","aircraft carrier","admiral"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.1","serverTime":"2017/04/15 19:49:04"}}
