His first complete film project was the ultra-low budget student film \"Brother John.\" As a young graduate of film school Dutcher poured everything he had into making his first feature-length film, the romantic comedy \"Girl Crazy.\" Although \"Girl Crazy\" was never screened theatrically, Dutcher did sell the picture to HBO, and was able to recoup his expenses. In 1997 Dutcher directed \"Eliza and I\", a play-like film based adapted from the play by BYU professor/actress/playwright Elizabeth J. Hansen, which was shown on public television and is available on video. Although he knew what he wanted to do, and he was certain he had the skill and experience to be able to do so, it took Dutcher three years to raise enough money to make a feature film about Latter-day Saints. Eventually Dutcher raised enough money to commence filming. \"God's Army\" was made with a budget of $300,000, a paltry sum by today's movie-making standards. But after it was released in Utah it became the second-highest grossing film in the state for that year. \"God's Army\" went on to be shown in theaters all over the country. It ended up grossing over $2.6 million in U.S. box office sales, and then sold over $2.5 million in videos and DVDs in the first year of video release. With the critical and financial success of \"God's Army\", Dutcher was easily able to raise money for this next film project. \"Brigham City\" opened in Utah theaters on April 6, 2001. It eventually played in theaters around the country. Critics generally considered it an even better film than \"God's Army.\" But its darker subject matter (the plot revolves around the sheriff's search for a serial killer), as well as its PG-13 rating seemed to keep some movie-goers away. On April 19 2001, just two weeks after the release of \"Brigham City\", anticipation was high as newspaper and TV reporters crowded the Bombay Room in Salt Lake City's Hotel Monaco. It was here that Dutcher announced the subject of his next film. He would make a movie about Joseph Smith, Jr., the first prophet and founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE0ODYzODQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3Nzc3NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244756","name":"Richard Dutcher","nicknames":["Father of Mormon Cinema"],"idIMDB":"nm0244756"},"actorId":"nm0244756","character":"Sheldon Lombard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joseph James","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3732492","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NTMxMjk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ1OTk0NjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Joseph James is a 32nd Degree Freemason and has spent almost a decade progressing through various Masonic organizations including the Shriners, The York Rite, Gul Reazee Grotto and The Scottish Rite.
