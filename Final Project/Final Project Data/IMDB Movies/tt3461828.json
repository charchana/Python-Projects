His lavish lifestyle, penchant for danger and carefree attitude has gotten him attention around the world as an international playboy. Bilzerian, 32, is a regular on the high-stakes poker scene, playing in private games with the rich and famous where every hand is more than most people's yearly salary. He has played in games where the minimum buy-in has been millions of dollars. Bilzerian is a relentless gambler who makes some of the most outrageous bets that are regularly the talk of the gambling world. From swimming across an alligator infested lake or jumping off a 90-foot cliff to simply betting on a random person's opinion or the flip of a coin, Bilzerian will take almost any wager. He made headlines when he competed in what has to have been the highest-stakes drag race in history, winning $385,000 at the Las Vegas Speedway. Bilzerian was driving a 1965 A/C Cobra and beat a 2011 Ferrari 458, which was considered at the time to be one of the fastest cars in the world. As an actor and stuntman, Bilzerian's credits include \"Olympus Has Fallen,\" starring Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman, as well as three films to be released in 2014:\"Lone Survivor,\" starring Mark Wahlberg; \"The Equalizer,\" starring Denzel Washington; and \"The Other Woman,\" starring Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton. True to his nature, Bilzerian spends his free time doing extreme sports around the world as well as training MMA, scuba diving, mountain biking, snowmobiling and racing cars. Bilzerian was born and raised in Tampa, Florida. Along with his brother Adam, Bilzerian invests in and manages business interests across a wide array of industries, including real estate, oil and entertainment.

Bilzerian left college after achieving significant financial success and focused his time on funding start up companies. Bilzerian divides his time between homes in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Diego.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwOTA3OTAwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ2NzI4NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3626447","name":"Dan Bilzerian","idIMDB":"nm3626447"},"actorId":"nm3626447","character":"Cordray","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt3461828","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3461828","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 36 min (96 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["Redcode RAW"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"4.4","filmingLocations":[{"location":"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA"}],"rated":"R","awards":[],"votes":"899","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0250136","name":"Lleju Productions"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["martial arts","espionage","shipping container","female nudity","stripper","private detective","woman punches a man","cooking competition","uzi","revenge","desert eagle","power armor","scorpion tattoo","sex montage","character's point of view camera shot","bribing the police","upskirt","nudity","breasts","scantily clad female","cleavage","split screen","reference to batman","reference to iron man","female assassin","sex scene","sequel","cajun","reference to jj abrams","shootout","shot in the forehead","nude fight","nude with a gun","murder","bare chested male","female rear nudity","female frontal nudity","military base","soldier","strip club","new orleans louisiana","midget","wedding reception","airboat","alligator","no opening credits","bayou","russian","senator","flashback","restaurant","brooklyn new york city","younger version of character","blood splatter","mini skirt","lingerie","blonde","black panties","red panties","blue panties","panties","nipples visible through clothing","title at the end","chinese","falling to death","exploding helicopter","interracial sex","severed hand","shot in the head","shot in the leg","cocaine","stabbed in the leg","stabbed in the hand","ninja","masked man","subtitled scene","shot in the eye","nude man murdered","nude woman murdered","shot to death","shot in the chest","pistol","stabbed to death","stabbed in the chest","competition","gala","professor","university","chef","corpse","tattoo","tattoo on hand","coroner","shuriken","speed dating","investigation","slow motion scene","555 phone number"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/13 19:16:26"}}
