Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on frontman Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public.","simplePlot":"The story of four young men from the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey who came together to form the iconic 1960s rock group The Four Seasons.","actors":[{"actorName":"Vincent Piazza","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1842344","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0Mjg3ODUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4MjY2Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR12,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1976","placeOfBirth":" Middle Village, Queens, New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Vincent Piazza was born on May 25, 1976 in Middle Village, Queens, New York City, New York, USA.

He won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in The Deer Hunter (1978), and has been seen in mostly supporting roles, often portraying psychologically unstable characters, though that generalization would not do justice to Walken's depth and breadth of performances. Walken was born in Astoria, Queens, to Rosalie (Russell), a Scottish immigrant, and Paul Walken, a German immigrant who ran Walken's Bakery. He learnt his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University & ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\". Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in Me and My Brother (1969), before appearing alongside Sean Connery in the sleeper heist movie The Anderson Tapes (1971). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of Diane Keaton suicidal younger brother in Annie Hall (1977), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying The Deer Hunter (1978). Walken was lured back by The Deer Hunter (1978) director Michael Cimino for a role in the financially disastrous western Heaven's Gate (1980), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in Pennies from Heaven (1981), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the Stephen King inspired The Dead Zone (1983) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure A View to a Kill (1985). Looking at many of Walken's other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in Biloxi Blues (1988), Wayne's World 2 (1993), Joe Dirt (2001), Mousehunt (1997) and America's Sweethearts (2001). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4ODUyNDQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODk2MTYz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000686","name":"Christopher Walken","nicknames":["Chris","Ronnie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000686"},"actorId":"nm0000686","character":"Gyp DeCarlo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0449523","main":true},{"actorName":"Kathrine Narducci","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0621393","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNzU1NjY3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ5NjA3NzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" East Harlem, New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 5½\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Kathrine Narducci was born on November 22, 1965 in East Harlem, New York City, New York, USA.

McGill, Jr. His brother Patrick was born in 1976. Mike grew up in the Fox River Valley and graduated from Appleton East High School in 1991. He attended The University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point from 1991 to 1993, when he took a break from his studies and enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve. He attended Basic Training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and A.I.T. at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He transferred to The University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh upon his return, where he graduated in 1995 with a degree in Radio/TV/Film. Mike belonged to the 432nd Civil Affairs Battalion in Green Bay, Wisconsin. His Army Reserve Unit was one of the first to be activated for Operation Joint Endeavor after the Dayton Peace Accord was signed. He spent January through July 1996 stationed overseas in Durdevik, Bosnia-Herzegovina. After his tour was over, Mike found work in the production department for WLUK-TV 11, the FOX affiliate in Green Bay, Wisconsin. His duties included running the audio board during the newscasts and inserting local commercial breaks in-between programs. One of the perks that came along with the job was getting paid to witness The Green Bay Packers march towards their Super Bowl XXXI victory over the New England Patriots. Fittingly, Mike's first full day as a resident of Los Angeles was April 1st, 1998 (April Fool's Day). His first TV program appearance was a small role as \"Babe Ruth\" in a flashback on an episode of Touched by an Angel (1994). He lives with his wife Amy, their son Jake and their dog Elvis in the San Fernando Valley, where he continues to further his acting career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NjA5NjA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODE2ODgy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1042946","name":"Michael Patrick McGill","nicknames":["Mo"],"idIMDB":"nm1042946"},"actorId":"nm1042946","character":"Officer Mike","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacqueline Mazarella","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1334901","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODUwNDY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA3MDA1Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Jacqueline Mazarella was born in New Jersey, USA.

He graduated with honors from San Francisco State University's Creative Arts Department and also attended the renowned American Conservatory Theatre, where he studied acting under Annette Bening. He has done much feature and television principle work, commercials and stage performances over the years. He got his start in film in San Francisco as an unfortunate nemesis to Dirty Harry, in \"The Dead Pool\" with Clint Eastwood. Soon thereafter an opportunity arose to traverse the country with an unusual theatrical company- for the next year Scott performed on makeshift stages in our nation's correctional institutions playing for appreciative audiences of prison inmates. With the constant touring and pressures of working inside prisons becoming less attractive, Scott moved to Hollywood in the late-nineties. He subsequently landed the starring role in the award-winning short film \"The Bicyclist.\" He then landed a lead role as head of the \"Fremen\" in the cult CD-ROM sensation \"Dune/Emperor,\" based on the Frank Herbert sci-fi classic. He had a principle role on the \"X-Files\" (in an episode written and directed by Gillian Anderson) and recurred as \"Agent Douglas\" on the ABC series \"Alias.\" He has appeared on HBO's \"Carnivale\" and was seen in the short-lived series, \"Threat Matrix,\" also on ABC. He had supporting roles in \"Everything Put Together\" starring Rada Mitchell (Helmed by famed director Marc Forster) and also in the cult film \"The Girl in the Cadillac.\" Scott then had an open-ended run on the NBC Daytime Soap, \"Passions\" until cancellation. He appeared as a nemesis to Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer in \"24\" on Fox and as a government agent in the final season of \"Sleeper Cell\" on Showtime. Scott had a guest-star run as Detective Kaplan on the final season of \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\" and recent roles on \"The Mentalist,\" \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Extant\" (opposite Halle Berry), the new \"Arrested Development\" for Netflix, a memorable guest star role on \"Days of Our Lives,\" \"American Crime,\" as the Ghost of Steve Jobs on \"My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,\" and more. Scott recently completed supporting roles in the features \"Spreading Darkness\" opposite Eric Roberts, as the \"Tall Man\" in the horror hit \"Bound to Vengeance\" and in yet-to-be released films such as the action pic \"Cockroaches\" as Harry, \"The Student\" (as Phil Van Sickle), and, most recently, as the lead vampire Pepin in \"Black Violet.\" Having come full-circle from his very first film, Scott had a terrific supporting role under the direction of Clint Eastwood in his movie \"Jersey Boys.\" His audio book (as narrator/producer) \"Living the Science of Mind\" is now available world-wide, along with his audio/visual Apple & Android apps for Centers for Spiritual Living. Scott also has three scripts of his own in various stages of development.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MjQ3NTgwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA4OTk4MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0888559","name":"Scott Vance","idIMDB":"nm0888559"},"actorId":"nm0888559","character":"Detective #1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Rankin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0710292","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MDIzNjgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY2Njc0NQ@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Steve Rankin was born in Eureka, Illinois, USA.
