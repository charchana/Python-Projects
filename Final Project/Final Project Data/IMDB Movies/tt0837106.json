He became a star in his teens through the title role in the TV-series Bombi Bitt och jag (1968). Between the years 1972-88 he was employed at The Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, where he participated in \"Vita rum\" (1988), August Strindberg's \"Ett drömspel\" (1986) and \"Mäster Olof\" (1988). Simultaneously Skarsgård did outstanding film roles, notably in The Simple-Minded Murderer (1982) by Hans Alfredson and with Fred Ward in American Playhouse: Noon Wine (1985). The fantastic performance gave him both a well-earned Guldbagge and Silver Berlin Bear. He portrayed the Skagen-painter Sören Kröyer in Hip Hip Hurrah! (1987) and the Swedish ambassador Raoul Wallenberg in Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg (1990), both directed by Kjell Grede.

Skarsgård did his first (but small) role in an big American film with The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). The role of Captain Tupolev in The Hunt for Red October (1990) was at supposed to be biggest part in a Hollywood-film, but unfortunately it was cut down. His breakthrough instead came with Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves (1996) opposite newcomer Emily Watson. After that Skarsgård got several supporting roles in American films, such as in My Son the Fanatic (1997), Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting (1997) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NDUzOTY0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYxODE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001745","name":"Stellan Skarsgård","nicknames":["Skarzie"],"idIMDB":"nm0001745"},"actorId":"nm0001745","character":"Birger Brosa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0049539","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Nyqvist","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0638824","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MDM4MTg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTExOTcwNw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 November 1960","placeOfBirth":" Stockholm, Stockholms län, Sweden","birthName":"Rolf Åke Mikael Nyqvist","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born Rolf Åke Mikael Nyqvist in Stockholm, Sweden, it wasn't until he was over a year old when he was finally adopted from the orphanage he had been given to. His father was a lawyer and his mother a writer. It wasn't until he had his first child that he decided to seek out his biological parents. After a long journey, he met his biological mother who is Swedish and is now close to his biological father who is Italian and a pharmacist. Acting wasn't always originally on the agenda for Nyqvist. A career in hockey was desired until an injury lead to an early retirement. At the age of 17, Nyqvist went to Omaha, Nebraska in America as an exchange student for a year. This is where his passion for acting first sparked. He took his first acting classes and played amongst other roles, a part in a school version of the drama Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller. However, upon returning to Sweden he got accepted into Ballet school but after one year gave it up insisting he was too \"stiff\" and twirls and twists were not for him. An ex-girlfriend suggested to try theatre instead and at 19 years old, he was accepted into the Swedish Academic School of Drama in Malmö. He then went onto work mainly in theatre but also had several parts in film productions. He became well known for his role as police officer Banck in the first series of Beck films made in 1997. His big breakthrough in European cinema came three years later, as he starred as Rolf, an alcoholic and abusive husband, in a film by Lucas Moodysson called Together. This role landed him his first Guldbagge nomination (Best Supporting Actor) and won him the Best Actor award at the Gijón International Film Festival. The accolades, awards and nominations flowed on from there. In 2002, Nyqvist played the leading man in the Swedish romantic comedy-drama, The Guy in the Grave Next Door directed by Kjell Sundvall and based on the novel of the same name written by Catherine Mazetti. He won a Best Actor Guldbagge award for his performance. The following year, Nyqvist starred as the leading role in the As It Is in Heaven which was Academy Award nominated for Best Foreign Film and his performance as an internationally renowned, struggling conductor earned Nyqvist his second nomination for a Best Actor Guldbagge award. In 2006, he was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Guldbagge award for his role in the film, Mother of Mine. Over the next few years he went on to star in several other films and plays as part of the Royal Dramatic Theatre. A notable role that Nyqvist portrayed was that of Swedish ambassador Harald Edelstam in the film the Black Pimpernel. Edelstam was a hero that saved several lives from execution in Chile during and after the military coupe in September 1973. In 2008, it was announced that Nyqvist was chosen to star as Mikael Blomkvist of the literary phenomenon, the Millenium Trilogy written by Stieg Larsson. It was long speculated by Scandinavian tabloids that fellow Swedish actor, Mikael Persbrandt could be chosen for the role of Blomkvist until Oplev claimed that 'he would not have been right for the role.' Oplev needed 'a humanist with his heart in the right place, a Swedish teddy bear whom women would feel safe in his arms...a man who respects women, regardless of what type they are.' Nyqvist's capabilities as an actor and his public persona scored him the role. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and its sequels, the Girl who Played with Fire and the Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest were released throughout 2009 throughout Europe and in the following year, throughout the rest of the world. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has garnered international critical acclaim. Oplev, Rapace (who starred as Lisbeth Salander, female protagonist of the trilogy) and Nyqvist all gained international recognition Nyqvist has said that his role as Blomkvist 'put him on the map internationally.' He has recently finished filming The Chinese Man based on the novel The Man from Beijing by well-known Swedish crime writer Henning Mankell, and Abduction directed by John Singleton. There has been speculation and talk from Mankell that Nyqvist would be his first choice to play Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme who was assassinated in 1986. Nyqvist is currently filming Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and is reportedly starring as the lead male villain of the film. Nyqvist is married to set designer, Catharina Ehrnrooth and has two children Ellen (born in 1991) and Arthur (born in 1996).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MDM4MTg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTExOTcwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0638824","name":"Michael Nyqvist","nicknames":["Micke"],"idIMDB":"nm0638824"},"actorId":"nm0638824","character":"Magnus Folkesson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0055267","main":true},{"actorName":"Mirja Turestedt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1316067","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 September 1972","placeOfBirth":"","bio":"Mirja Turestedt graduated from The National Academy of Music and Drama in Sweden in 2002.

He was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, to a German mother and a Spanish businessman father. From the classical theatre stage (Paris Conservatoire, L'Ecole des Amandiers) in works ranging from Shakespeare to Chekhov, Perez became an instant romantic idol after pairing opposite slightly older femme stars Jacqueline Bisset in La maison de jade (1988) and Catherine Deneuve in the Oscar-winning film Indochine (1992). His breakthrough role, however, came as the callow, vacuous lover \"Christian\" opposite Gérard Depardieu's Cyrano de Bergerac (1990). The film is considered these days the definitive version of the Edmond Rostand classic. With this European success, the lithe, moody heartthrob branched out internationally, finally making his American film debut in The Crow: City of Angels (1996), taking over the vengeful title role from the late Brandon Lee who was accidentally killed in the original. The sequel proved crashingly dull and the U.S. has been surprisingly unreceptive to Perez ever since. This may be in part due to his subsequent American movies, which have included the passionless I Dreamed of Africa (2000), Bride of the Wind (2001) and Queen of the Damned (2002) with the late musical star Aaliyah. Perez has been married to model/actress Karine Silla since 1998 and they have three children, including one set of twins). Sylla also has a child by Perez's ex-co-star Gérard Depardieu. In Europe, however, Perez is an art-house favorite.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMDI4MDQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzkyMjM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001641","name":"Vincent Perez","idIMDB":"nm0001641"},"actorId":"nm0001641","character":"Broder Guilbert","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0244798","main":true},{"actorName":"Julia Dufvenius","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0240766","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MzQ2MDUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU1NzI3._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 October 1975","placeOfBirth":"","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Julia Dufvenius was born on October 8, 1975.
