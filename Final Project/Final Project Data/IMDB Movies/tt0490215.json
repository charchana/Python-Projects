When he was three, he moved to Surrey, U.K., with his parents and older brother. He is of English and Polish-Jewish heritage. Andrew was raised in a middle class family, and attended a private school, the City of London Freemen's School. He began acting in youth theatre productions while he was still at school. At age 19, he went to the Central School of Speech and Drama. His first professional roles were on the stage and in 2005 he made his TV debut in the Channel 4 teen series Sugar Rush (2005) in the UK. More TV work followed (reaching a wider UK audience in a two-part story in the third season of Doctor Who (2005)), as well as a number of movie appearances. Garfield played Eduardo in The Social Network (2010) and Tommy in Never Let Me Go (2010), two films that brought him to full international attention. That same year, he was cast as the title character in the reboot of the Spider-Man film franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). He reprised the role in the sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), before passing off the torch to Tom Holland. Resuming his work in drama films, Garfield starred in Ramin Bahrani's 99 Homes (2014), with Michael Shannon, Mel Gibson's Tu ne tueras point (2016), about real-life Seventh Day Adventist war hero Desmond Doss, and Martin Scorsese's Silence (2016), opposite Adam Driver, playing Jesuit priests. His upcoming films include the Andy Serkis-directed drama Breathe (2017), where Garfield plays an adventurous man paralyzed by polio, and David Robert Mitchell's noir thriller Under the Silver Lake (2017).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MjI2OTk1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY1NzM4MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1940449","name":"Andrew Garfield","nicknames":["Andy"],"idIMDB":"nm1940449"},"actorId":"nm1940449","character":"Rodrigues","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0513213","main":true},{"actorName":"Adam Driver","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3485845","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0OTA0NjU0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzNjk3Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 November 1983","placeOfBirth":" San Diego, California, USA","birthName":"Adam Douglas Driver","height":"6' 2½\" (1.89 m)","bio":"Adam Douglas Driver was born in San Diego, California.

His stepfather is a Baptist minister. His ancestry includes English, as well as Dutch, German, Irish, and Scottish. Driver was raised in Mishawaka after his parents' divorce, attending Mishawaka High School, where he appeared in plays. After 9/11, he enlisted in the Marines, serving for more than two years before being medically discharged after he suffered an injury, which prevented him from being deployed. Driver attended the University of Indianapolis (for a year) and then transferred to study drama at Juilliard in New York, graduating in 2009. He began acting in plays, appearing on Broadway, before being cast in Lena Dunham's series Girls (2012), as her character's love interest, Adam Sackler. The role gained him attention, and he subsequently began a robust film career, appearing in small roles in J.

Antrim, Northern Ireland, UK","birthName":"William John Neeson","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Liam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, UK, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, truck driver, assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role. Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including The Bounty (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984), The Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1993), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindler's List (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor. Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Taken (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Clash of the Titans (2010) and The A-Team (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown (2011), The Grey (2011), Battleship (2012) and Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel La colère des Titans (2012). Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MTQ3NzU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE3Mjg0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553","name":"Liam Neeson","idIMDB":"nm0000553"},"actorId":"nm0000553","character":"Ferreira","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0513212","main":true},{"actorName":"Tadanobu Asano","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038355","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MzM5MTk5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTcxMTY1MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 November 1973","placeOfBirth":" Yokohama, Japan","birthName":"Tadanobu Satô","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Asano Tadanobu is a Japanese film actor. His father, an actors' agent, suggested he take on what became his first role, in the TV show \"Kimpachi Sensei,\" at the age of 16. His film debut was in the 1990 Swimming Upstream (Bataashi kingyo (1990)), though his first major critical success was in Shunji Iwai's Fried Dragon Fish (1993). His first critical success in the West was in Hirokazu Koreeda's Maborosi (1995), in which he played a man who inexplicably throws himself in front of a train, widowing his wife and orphaning his infant son. His best known works internationally are the samurai films Gohatto (1999) and The Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi (2003). It was on the set of Iwai's Picnic (1996) that he met and fell in love with J-Pop idol Chara. They married soon after learning she was pregnant with their first child, Sumire. While best known for characters who are psychologically offbeat, if not downright psychotic (e.g. Kakihara in Ichi the Killer (2001)), Asano has been described by those who know him as a down-to-earth family man. He has directed commercial TV spots for Chara. Hesistant to identify himself as an actor, he most readily describes himself as a vocalist, referring to Mach 1.67, the band he has with director Gakuryû Ishii. He's also an artist, and sometimes works as a model, most notably for the Japanese designers Takeo Kikuchi and Jun Takahashi.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MzM5MTk5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTcxMTY1MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038355","name":"Tadanobu Asano","idIMDB":"nm0038355"},"actorId":"nm0038355","character":"Interpreter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0513215","main":true},{"actorName":"Ciarán Hinds","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001354","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyNjM0MzU0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIxMzg1MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 February 1953","placeOfBirth":" Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Ciaran Hinds was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland on February 9, 1953. He was one of five children and the only son. His father was a doctor who hoped to have Ciaran follow in his footsteps, but that was not to be. It was his mother Moya, an amateur actress, who was the real influence behind his decision to become an actor. Though he did enroll in Law at Queens' University of Belfast, he left that in order to train in acting at RADA. He began his stage career at the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre as a pantomime horse in the production of \"Cinderella\". Staying with the company for several years, he starred in a number of productions, including playing the lead roles in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" and \"Faust\". His stage career has included working with The Field Day Company and a number of world tours. He has starred in a number of productions with the Royal Shakespeare Company, including a world tour in the title role of \"Richard III\". Hinds' film career began in 1981 in the movie Excalibur (1981), which boasted a cast rich in talented actors including Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne and Patrick Stewart. In-between his movie work, he's amassed a large number of television credits. Playing such classic characters as \"Mr. Rochester\" in Jane Eyre (1997), and \"Captain Wentworth\" in Screen Two: Persuasion (1995) has increased his popularity and most definitely given him much increased recognition. As for his personal life, you won't be likely to see his name in the weekly tabloids. He likes to keep his private life private. It is known that he is in a long-term, committed relationship with a French-Vietnamese actress named Hélène Patarot and they have a daughter together and live in Paris. He is in very high demand and his reputation as a quality, professional actor is sure to keep him busy for as long as he chooses.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyNjM0MzU0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIxMzg1MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001354","name":"Ciarán Hinds","idIMDB":"nm0001354"},"actorId":"nm0001354","character":"Father Valignano","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0526786","main":true},{"actorName":"Issei Ogata","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0644521","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDkzYjNjOGItYTg4NC00Yzg2LWI0MGYtNTQ2MDI5NmQwY2FiL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 February 1952","placeOfBirth":" Fukuoka, Japan","birthName":"Kazushige Ogata","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Issei Ogata was born on February 22, 1952 in Fukuoka, Japan as Kazushige Ogata.
