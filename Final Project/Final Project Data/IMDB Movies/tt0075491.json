To kick off his mid-life career change, Jones attended Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama in Kent, England, on a scholarship. He then worked in repertory theater, later joining up with the Royal Shakespeare Company and gaining recognition as an actor of exceptional cleverness, intelligence and perception. His theatrical film debut came in 1967 in Peter Brook's critically acclaimed, Marat/Sade (1967). Two years later, Jones made his mark on the acting world playing \"Claudius\" in the six-part television miniseries, The Caesars (1968). Based on this performance, he was named \"The World's Best Television Actor of the Year\" at the Monte-Carlo TV Festival in 1969. Also, around this time, Jones gave one of his most touching film performances, that of the \"monster\" in Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969), in which he displayed pathos reminiscent of Boris Karloff's monster. Critical acclaim led Jones to more prominent roles in television, e.g., The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976), Children of the Stones (1977), and Pennies from Heaven (1978), as well as in film, e.g., The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970), Antony and Cleopatra (1972), All Creatures Great and Small (1975) and Zulu Dawn (1979). Jones achieved international recognition as a film actor after appearing in such Hollywood films as Clint Eastwood's Firefox (1982) and David Lynch's The Elephant Man (1980), Dune (1984) and Wild at Heart (1990). Arguably one of his most endearing roles was the frequently drunk reporter \"Orlando\" in Federico Fellini's And the Ship Sails On (1983). His theatrical acting has been especially well-suited for literary drama, e.g., Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), Nicholas Nickleby (1977), Silas Marner (1985), Screen One: Adam Bede (1992), David Copperfield (2000) and The Count of Monte Cristo (2002). Jones' eccentric, twitchy portrayals, often bordering on caricature, although sometimes criticized, have nevertheless ensured his international recognition and popularity as a character actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNjc3MTQxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2ODgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428086","name":"Freddie Jones","idIMDB":"nm0428086"},"actorId":"nm0428086","character":" Dai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0104650","main":true},{"actorName":"John Woodnutt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940407","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 March 1924","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"John Woodnutt was a serious, gaunt-faced character actor with extensive stage experience. He made his professional acting debut at the Oxford Playhouse at the age of 18. He also performed Shakespearean roles at the Open Air Theatre at London's Regent's Park. He had a long string of television credits to his name, most often in coldly authoritarian, military or aristocratic roles. Early in his career, he appeared in adventure serials and swashbucklers for BBC television. A versatile actor who was willing to appear under monster makeup and rubber suits, he was later seen in four different installments of Doctor Who (1963) between 1970 and 1981 opposite Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940407","name":"John Woodnutt","idIMDB":"nm0940407"},"actorId":"nm0940407","character":" Link","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peggy Ann Wood","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0939933","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 June 1912","placeOfBirth":" Chiswick, London, England, UK","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Peggy Ann Wood was born on June 14, 1912 in Chiswick, London, England.
