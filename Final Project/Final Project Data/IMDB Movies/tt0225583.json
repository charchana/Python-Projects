Méliès was an especially prolific innovator in the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color. His films include A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films. Méliès died of cancer on 21 January 1938 at the age of 76. In 2016, a Méliès film long thought lost, A Wager Between Two Magicians, was discovered in a Czechoslovak film archive.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNzM5MzEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3NzMyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0617588","name":"Georges Méliès","idIMDB":"nm0617588"},"actorId":"nm0617588","character":"The Man","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0039322","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0225583","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0225583","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 min"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["39.62 m"],"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.9","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"374","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0023239","name":"Georges Méliès"},{"idCompany":"co0015284","name":"Star-Film"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["inn","traveler","hat","bed","sleeplessness","trick film","fast motion scene","undressing","trousers","shirt","removing trousers","magic","magic spell","bowler hat","bedroom"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 02:48:34"}}
