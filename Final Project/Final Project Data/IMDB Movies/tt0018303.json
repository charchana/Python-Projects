He became a popular and successful rodeo star, winning national championships. In 1914, after touring the U.S. in a Wild West show, he came to Hollywood and got work as a stuntman. He had a handsome, stalwart quality that, along with his skills as a cowhand, quickly gained him the attention of producers and studios. Born John Stone, he changed his name to Hartford Hoxie and then to Art Hoxie when producer Anthony J. Xydias of Sunset Productions signed him for a series of low-budget Westerns. By 1921 Hoxie was successful enough to catch the eye of Universal Pictures, which hired him away and placed in him in more prestigious westerns. Although not a star of the magnitude of Douglas Fairbanks or Charles Chaplin, Hoxie was a prominent name among western stars. His career faded quickly after sound, as even though he looked the part of a cowboy, his skills did not extend to sounding like one (he could barely read). He continued to appear, albeit in smaller roles, well into the 1930s, when he left Hollywood to star in his own western-style circus. By the end of the 1930s he had retired to a ranch in Oklahoma, where he lived out his days in obscurity. He died in Kansas in 1965 at the age of 80. He was survived by his brother, lesser-known cowboy actor Al Hoxie.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQ5NjJiYjYtZDQ0YS00OTNmLWJlZDEtODAwZGFmN2NiN2ZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0398300","name":"Jack Hoxie","idIMDB":"nm0398300"},"actorId":"nm0398300","character":"Hank Kinney","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dorothy Gulliver","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0347827","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNjYjMyZWEtYTY3OS00MzdlLTgyN2UtYjgwYTdiOWE4YWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 September 1908","placeOfBirth":" Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","birthName":"Dorothy Kathleen Gulliver","height":"5' 2\" (1.57 m)","bio":"As an avid movie fan, Dorothy got her chance to go to Hollywood when she won a Salt Lake City beauty contest sponsored by Universal Pictures. Signed by Universal after her successful screen test, Dorothy became one of the many contract actors working in small bit parts. She became well known due to her roles in series and serial movies from 'College Love (1929)' to 'The Last Frontier (1932)'. Dorothy appeared in a number of low budget Westerns such as 'In Old Cheyenne (1931)' and 'The Fighting Marshal (1932)'. Over the years that she appeared in Westerns, she worked with actors such as Jack Hoxie, Hoot Gibson, Wild Bill Elliott and John Wayne. By 1933, Dorothy found that her roles had become so small that in the film 'King Kong (1933)', she would be credited as \"Girl\". For the rest of the decade, she appeared in but a handful of films which were mostly 'B' movie Westerns. After that, she left films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNjYjMyZWEtYTY3OS00MzdlLTgyN2UtYjgwYTdiOWE4YWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0347827","name":"Dorothy Gulliver","idIMDB":"nm0347827"},"actorId":"nm0347827","character":"Ruth Buxley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"C.E.
