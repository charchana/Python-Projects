He had English, Irish, and Welsh ancestry. Alan had an older brother David, a younger brother Michael and a younger sister Sheila. When Alan was 8 years old, his father died. He attended Latymer Upper School on a scholarship. He studied Graphic Design at Chelsea College of Art and Design, where he met Rima Horton, who would later become his life partner. After three years at Chelsea College, Rickman did graduate studies at the Royal College of Art. He opened a successful graphics design business, Graphiti, with friends and ran it for several years before his love of theatre led him to seek an audition with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). At the relatively late age of 26, Rickman received a scholarship to RADA, which started a professional acting career that has lasted nearly 40 years, a career which has spanned stage, screen and television and lapped over into directing, as well. Rickman first came to the attention of American audiences as \"Vicomte de Valmont\" in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" on Broadway in 1987 (he was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in the role). Denied the role in the film version of the show, Rickman instead made his first movie appearance opposite Bruce Willis in Die Hard (1988) as the villain, \"Hans Gruber\". Rickman's take on the urbane villain set the standard for screen villains for decades to come. Though often cited as being a master of playing villains, Rickman actually played a wide variety of characters, such as the romantic cello-playing ghost \"Jamie\" in Anthony Minghella's Truly Madly Deeply (1990) and the noble \"Colonel Brandon\" of Sense and Sensibility (1995). He treated audiences to his comedic abilities with films like Dogma (1999), Galaxy Quest (1999) and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), and roles like \"Dr. Alfred Blalock\" in Something the Lord Made (2004) and \"Alex Hughes\" in Snow Cake (2006), showcase his ability to play ordinary men in extraordinary situations. Rickman even conquered the daunting task of singing a part in a Stephen Sondheim musical as he took on the part of \"Judge Turpin\" in the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007). In 2001, Rickman introduced himself to a whole new, and younger, generation of fans by taking on the role of \"Severus Snape\" in the movie versions of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). He continued to play the role through the eighth and last movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNTc4MTg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY2MjkxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000614","name":"Alan Rickman","idIMDB":"nm0000614"},"actorId":"nm0000614","character":"Steven Spurrier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0092925","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-Michel Richaud","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724833","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNzc3Mzk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAxMDgwMzE@._V1_UY44_CR10,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1971","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Jean-Michel F.

He is of Dutch (mother) and English, Northern Irish, and Scottish (father) descent. After high school, Bill went into a building construction program at SUNY Delhi in New York. He transferred to State University of New York College at Oneonta where he received his BA in Theater. He received both his MFA in Theater/Directing and an honorary PHD from University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching Directing at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, one of Bill's students was the soon-to-be film director John Dahl, who later cast Mr. Pullman in \"The Last Seduction\". Moving to New York City, he worked with Kathy Bates in the acclaimed stage production of \"Curse of the Starving Class\". However, it was his first work in three strikingly diverse films that brought him to the attention of his audience: \"Ruthless People\" with Danny DeVito and Bette Milder, the Mel Brooks hit \"Spaceballs\" and the Oscar-nominated (and winner for Best Actress Gina Davis) \"The Accidental Tourist\". Still attracted to the art and study of building construction, Bill has designed and/or restored three \"barns\": In Montana, he converted a 1933 barn at his ranch into his family home. In Los Angeles, he built a Truss barn in the style of LA's 1910 fruit storage barns. In western New York State, he restored a '3-bay' barn that sometimes serves as a community center near his hometown of Hornell, New York. Focused more on neighborhoods than show business-based charities and societies, Pullman has defined himself by his work with his local communities. He works to bridge communities of Los Angeles through his board work with Cornerstone Theater. Pullman continues to work with his neighbors who formed \"Concerned Citizens Montana\" to secure a place at the table regarding the national need for a smart grid for energy transmission. He also works with the local university (Alfred University, New York) as well as supports local health services (\"The Pullman Women's Health and Birthing Center\" at St James Hospital, Hornell, NY). Pullman is also an MS Society Ambassador. Based in Los Angeles, New York City and Western Montana, Pullman is married to the dancer, Tamara Hurwitz Pullman, and they have three children, daughter singer/songwriter Maesa Rae, and multi-talented sons Jack and Lewis.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0Mzk2MDEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTczMDQzNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000597","name":"Bill Pullman","idIMDB":"nm0000597"},"actorId":"nm0000597","character":"Jim Barrett","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0092926","main":true},{"actorName":"Kirk Baily","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047663","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NTYxNjQ0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMyMjE1MzE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 September 1952","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"Kirk Baily was born on September 9, 1952 in New York City, New York, USA.
