Hart lived for a while in the Dakota Territory, then worked as a postal clerk in New York City. In 1888 he began to study acting. In 1899 he created the role of Messala in \"Ben-Hur\", and received excellent reviews for his lead part in \"The Virginian\" (1907). His first film was a two-reeler, His Hour of Manhood (1914). In 1915 he signed a contract with Thomas H. Ince and joined Ince's Triangle Film Company. Two years later he followed Ince to Famous Players-Lasky and received a very lucrative contract from Adolph Zukor. His career began to dwindle in the early 1920s due to the publicity surrounding a paternity suit against him, which was eventually dismissed. He made his last film, Tumbleweeds (1925), for United Artists and retired to a ranch in Newhall, CA. By that time audiences were more interested in the antics of a Tom Mix or Hoot Gibson than the Victorian moralizing of Hart. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, NY.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0MzczMTYzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTcyNzM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0366586","name":"William S.
