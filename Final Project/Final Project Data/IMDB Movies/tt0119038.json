Perhaps best known for work in farcical comedies, the tall, handsome actor has appeared in some of France's more outrageous films over the course of his prolific career. Born in Paris on November 24, 1952, Lhermitte began his career as one of the founding members of the comedy troupe Le Splendid. Among the troupe's other founders were Patrice Leconte, Josiane Balasko, and Michel Blanc, all of whom Lhermitte would collaborate with on future films. After his film debut in Bertrand Blier's Les Valseuses (1974) and a supporting role in Bertrand Tavernier's Que La Fête Commence... (1975), Lhermitte had his first screen collaboration with his Le Splendid colleagues, co-writing and acting in Leconte's Les Bronzés (1978). A farcical satire about a group of French tourists vacationing in Africa, the film proved to be phenomenally popular in France, inspiring a sequel the next year and a dedicated cult following. Lhermitte subsequently made his mark starring in a number of comedies, including Les Hommes Preferent les Grosses (1981) with Balasko, Jean-Loup Hubert's L'Année Prochaine...Si Tout Va Bien (1981) with Isabelle Adjani, and Blier's La Femme De Mon Pote (1983). He maintained a prolific work schedule throughout the '80s and '90s, continuing to play the romantic lead in comedies of every possible variety for a diverse array of directors. Lhermitte also continued to collaborate with his Le Splendid colleagues, starring in Leconte's 1993 Tango as a man intent on murdering his wife after she leaves him, and alongside Balasko in Grosse Fatigue, a comedy that featured Michel Blanc both directing and acting in a double role. In 1998, Lhermitte had one of his greatest successes to date as one of the stars of Francis Veber's Le Dîner de Cons. A witty comedy of manners, it featured the actor in top form as an arrogant publisher put in his place by the seemingly moronic man (Jacques Villeret) he has invited to his weekly dinner of idiots. One of the most popular films to be released in France in years, it was a phenomenal hit with critics and audiences alike. In addition to acting, Lhermitte has continued to work as a screenwriter and producer. In 1994, he wrote, produced, and starred in the children's comedy Un Indien dans la Ville; three years later he served as the associate producer for its American remake, Jungle 2 Jungle. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi Children: Victor Lhermitte, Louise Lhermitte, Astree Lhermitte-Soka Father: Andre Lhermitte","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTA0NzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ4MzAz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0508293","name":"Thierry Lhermitte","idIMDB":"nm0508293"},"actorId":"nm0508293","character":"Pierre Brochant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0217503","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacques Villeret","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898317","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 February 1951","placeOfBirth":" Tours, Indre-et-Loire, France","birthName":"Jacky Boufroura","height":"5' 5¼\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Jacques Villeret was born on February 6, 1951 in Tours, Indre-et-Loire, France as Jacky Boufroura.

His father was a commercial director in important carmanufacturor. His mother owned a sewing atelier. But it was because of his grandmother, a real movie passionate, that Francis was captivated by cinema. His heroes on the big screen were John Wayne, Gary Cooper and Steve McQueen. Aged 15 he decided to become an actor and studied Dramatic Art at the Cours François Florent. Some years later, Francis Huster was to become a teacher at Florent himself. Maruschka Detmers and his lifepartner Cristiana Réali were some of his pupils. In 1968 Huster went to the National Conservatory. Three years later in 1971, winning a couple of prices in the process, he entered the famous Comédie Française. From then on Huster plays some important roles like Lorenzaccio, Don Juan and Guy Blas. In the same period (1970) he also played his first movie, La faute de l'Abbé Mouret, directed by Georges Franju. After 10 years he decided in 1981 to leave the Comédie Française in order to be more then just an old young romantic type. Only the cinema will be his next metier. His goal was to become a big star so he could play the big roles. First he played 'Qu'est-ce qui fait courir David ?' in 1981. He starred in 'La femme publique', directed by Andrzej Zulawski. Further movies he played in were 'L'amour braque', 'Equateur' (directed by Serge Gainsbourg in 1983), 'Orphée moderne' and 'Parking' in 1984. In 1986 he directed his first movie 'On a volé Charlie Spencer'. In 1997, 'Le dîner de cons', directed by Francis Veber, was a big hit.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404091","name":"Francis Huster","idIMDB":"nm0404091"},"actorId":"nm0404091","character":"Juste Leblanc","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Daniel Prévost","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0699545","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 October 1939","placeOfBirth":" Garches, Hauts-de-Seine, France","bio":"Daniel Prévost was born on October 20, 1939 in Garches, Hauts-de-Seine, France.
