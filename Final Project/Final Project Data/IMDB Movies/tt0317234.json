Jang Seung-up (1843-1897), also called Owon, focusing on the years 1882 to 1897, when Korea was in political upheaval, caught between China and Japan, the conservative dynasty dying, and peasant revolt at hand. Jang, born poor, has genius; a merchant, Kim, becomes his patron, finding him a teacher. Jang must convince others that a commoner can have talent, then move beyond his ability to copy old masters and find his own style. He's bedeviled by a temper and alcohol, arguments with patrons as he seeks commissions, and relationships with kisaeng, particularly Mae-hyang, that start and stop. It's the life of a restless spirit producing great art.","simplePlot":"In a time of political and social unrest in nineteenth-century Korea, an uncouth, self-taught painter explores his natural talent amidst the repressive world around him.","actors":[{"actorName":"Min-sik Choi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0158856","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg4MDM3NDA0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODExMzMyMjE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 January 1962","placeOfBirth":" Seoul, South Korea","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Choi Min-shik first made a name for himself in theater before breaking into the film world with a role in Park Chong-won's acclaimed film 'Our Twisted Hero' (1992).
