From a young age he had the urge to perform and eventually got his start in the music, playing the drums. By the age of 15 Rick was doing national tours with elite organizations DCI and WGI. After several hard years within the music industry and many bumps in the road, Rick sought after new creative outlets and eventually took a shot in the dark with his first acting class. Rick is now known for his portrayals of the lead characters 'Diego Campos' on season 2 of the 5X Emmy nominated hit Hulu series 'East Los High', 'Luis' on the award winning viral series 'Bubala Please', and 'David Flores' on the independent feature film 'I Am Gangster' that has shocked audiences across the globe. You can also catch him weekly as a host on 'Curious Radio', the comedic enlightenment podcast available on iTunes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGRhNWJhMGEtZDRmOC00YmY0LTkzMTUtMzZjMmIzNWI2OTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE5Nzc1Mjc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5145138","name":"Rick Mancia","idIMDB":"nm5145138"},"actorId":"nm5145138","character":"Graffiti Artist","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrew Walke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3659231","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Andrew Walke is an actor, known for Graffiti Area (2014) and If Not Now When (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3659231","name":"Andrew Walke","idIMDB":"nm3659231"},"actorId":"nm3659231","character":"Graffiti Artist / Friend","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt3796026","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3796026","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":null,"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.1","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"9","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0313004","name":"Independent Films"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:04:58"}}
