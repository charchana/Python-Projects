However, the breakthrough role in Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless (1960) made him one of the key figures in the French New Wave. Since mid-60s he completely switched to commercial mainstream pictures and became a big comedy and action star in France. Following the example of Alain Delon he founded his own production company Cerito named after his grandmother's maiden name. In 1989 he was awarded Cesar for his performance in Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté (1988) . Recently he returned to stage performing in the Theatre Marigny in Paris. He still appears in the movies but not so often as before preferring mostly dramatic roles. The president of France distinguished him with order of Legion of Honour. Belmondo has daughter Florence and son Paul. His elder daughter Patricia died in a fire in 1994. None of his children became actors though you could have seen his son Paul in the episodic role in Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté (1988).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MTAwNDUxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI0MDgzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000901","name":"Jean-Paul Belmondo","nicknames":["Bebel"],"idIMDB":"nm0000901"},"actorId":"nm0000901","character":"Sam Lion","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Anconina","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025857","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNzYzMzA1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDA4NjE0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 January 1953","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Richard Anconina was born on January 28, 1953 in Paris, France.

He left home at age 16 to take dramatic arts classes under the guidance of Louis Jouvet. After a long apprenticeship in extra films parts beginning in 1941, he finally earned leading roles in 1949 and went on to mesmerize audiences in such films as Rendez-vous de juillet (1949), Le Plaisir (1952), Napoleon (1955), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Testament of Orpheus (1960) and many more. It's generally considered, however, that he squandered his talent and could have accomplished much more. His personal life was a mess. The turbulent Gelin lived a highrollercoaster life with stormy relationships that led to suicide attempts and a long battle with alcohol and drugs. One son, Pascal Gelin, died at the age of 14 months when he accidentally swallowed pills in 1957. In 1999, another son, Xavier Gélin, lost his battle with cancer. He was married three times. His daughter, actress Maria Schneider, however, was the product of his liasion with French model Christine Marie Schneider, whom he never married.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMjA5NjEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA3MjI5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004625","name":"Daniel Gélin","idIMDB":"nm0004625"},"actorId":"nm0004625","character":"Pierrot Duvivier, père de Al","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alexis Gruss","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1148974","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Alexis Gruss is an actor and writer, known for Empreintes (2007), Vivement dimanche (1998) and Thé ou café (1996).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1148974","name":"Alexis Gruss","idIMDB":"nm1148974"},"actorId":"nm1148974","character":"Monsieur Loyal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicolas Mallet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1152780","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nicolas Mallet is an actor, known for Itinéraire d'un enfant gâté (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1152780","name":"Nicolas Mallet","idIMDB":"nm1152780"},"actorId":"nm1152780","character":"Sam à 3 ans","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0095386","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095386","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":[{"money":"3,254,100 (France)","country":"","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},{"money":"27,676","country":"West","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null}],"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 hr 5 min (125 min)","2 hr (120 min) (West Germany)"],"soundMix":["70 mm 6-Track (70 mm prints)","Dolby (35 mm prints)"],"color":["Color (Eastmancolor)"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.1","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany"}],"rated":"TOUS PUBLICS","awards":[{"award":"Chicago International Film Festival 1989","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Gold Hugo","categories":[{"category":"Best Feature","names":[{"name":"Claude Lelouch","id":"nm0500988","role":"director"}]}]}]},{"award":"César Awards, France 1989","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won César","categories":[{"category":"Best Actor (Meilleur acteur)","names":[{"name":"Jean-Paul Belmondo","id":"nm0000901","role":null}]}]},{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated César","categories":[{"category":"Best Actor (Meilleur acteur)","names":[{"name":"Richard Anconina","id":"nm0025857","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Music (Meilleure musique)","names":[{"name":"Francis Lai","id":"nm0006162","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"1,532","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0031937","name":"Les Films 13"},{"idCompany":"co0054517","name":"Cerito Films"},{"idCompany":"co0079764","name":"TF1 Films Production"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["1980s","title appears in writing","song in title","song","father daughter reunion","gay","computer","hotel","fired employee","camera","africa","paris france","shit","cleaning","father daughter relationship","wheelchair","safari","singapore","funeral","orphan","midlife crisis","lifeboat","reunion","reference to al capone","marriage proposal","gas station","hotel room","alcatraz island","assumed dead","disappearing act","yacht","victoria falls","abandoned child","lion","circus"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 08:22:17"}}
