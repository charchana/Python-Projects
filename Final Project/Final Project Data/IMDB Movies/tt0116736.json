During this year she became interested in acting and decided that this was her future. Back in Sweden, she got a role in a TV-series but her first application to become a student at the Royal Dramatic Theatre was rejected. Acting lessons for 'Margreth Weivers' made the third attempt successfull. After her studies she worked both at the Royal Dramatic Theatre and Stockholm's City Theatre. She made her breakthrough with 1939 (1989). Colin Nutley saw her face on a poster for Les femmes sur le toit (1989) and cast her for his movie BlackJack (1990).
