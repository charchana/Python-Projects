The amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to riches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia (Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise. Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Stay Hungry (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy The Villain (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie The Jayne Mansfield Story (1980). What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan the Barbarian (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan the Destroyer (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - The Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller The Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), Predator (1987), The Running Man (1987) and Red Heat (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Twins (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular Total Recall (1990) and \"feel good\" Kindergarten Cop (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners. Remarkably, his next film Last Action Hero (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller True Lies (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Jingle All the Way (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Eraser (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of End of Days (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale The 6th Day (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Collateral Damage (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception. It was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date. Schwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children. In October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce. Schwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to The Rundown (2003), Around the World in 80 Days (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in The Expendables 2 (2012), The Last Stand (2013), Escape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator Genisys (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MDc4NzUyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQyMTc5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","nicknames":["Arnie","Austrian Oak","Conan the Republican","Styrian Oak","The Governator","The Running Man","Conan the Governor","The Machine"],"idIMDB":"nm0000216"},"actorId":"nm0000216","character":"Terminator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000931","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Biehn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000299","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2OTI1MTEyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM5NTQ4NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 July 1956","placeOfBirth":" Anniston, Alabama, USA","birthName":"Michael Connell Biehn","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Michael Connell Biehn was born on July 31, 1956 in Anniston, Alabama, to Marcia (Connell) and Don Biehn, a lawyer.

Born in 1939 in Los Angeles, he lived there in his early years before moving with his family to Los Angeles' Watts district. He showed early promise as a student at Manual Arts High School, earning distinction with several performance awards. As a senior, he earned his first professional acting job and extended his theatrical education with a two-year scholarship to the University of Portland in Oregon. Subsequent scholarships led to his studies at Stanford and Los Angeles City College, among other colleges. He left U.C.L.A. just six credits short of his Bachelor's degree. Paul's first big break came in 1964 when actor/director Burgess Meredith gave him a role in Le Roi Jones' controversial one-act play \"The Dutchman and the Toilet\". Director Meredith cast him again four years in \"The Latent Heterosexual\" with Zero Mostel. Although he won a contract at Columbia Pictures in 1966 and built up his on-camera career with a succession of television credits, he continued to focus on the legitimate stage. A member of the Stanford Repertory Theatre, he concentrated on both classic and contemporary plays. In 1969, Paul joined the Inner City Cultural Center Theatre in Los Angeles for two years, which offered a drama program for high school students. In the late 1960s, Paul redirected himself back to performing on television and in films with guest work in more than 40 series on the small screen, including a boyfriend role on the first season of the landmark black sitcom Julia (1968) starring Diahann Carroll. In films, he was given a featured role in the Sidney Poitier film The Lost Man (1969), and earned comparable roles in R.P.M. (1970) and Brother John (1971) before major stardom occurred. 1972 proved to be a banner year for Paul after winning the male lead opposite Cicely Tyson in the touching classic film Sounder (1972). His towering performance as a sharecropper who is imprisoned and tortured for stealing a ham for his impoverished family earned him an Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\" -- the third black actor (Sidney Poitier and James Earl Jones preceded him) to receive such an honor at the time. From there a host of films and quality television roles began arriving on his doorstep. In minimovies, Paul portrayed various historical/entertainment giants including Thurgood Marshall, Don King and baseball's Roy Campanella, and was Emmy-nominated for his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. in King (1978) with Sounder co-star Cicely Tyson as wife Coretta. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he earned solid distinction in such prestige projects as Backstairs at the White House (1979), Roots: The Next Generations (1979) (another Emmy nomination), The Sophisticated Gents (1981), The Blue and the Gray (1982), Sister, Sister (1982), James Baldwin's American Playhouse: Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), Under Siege (1986) and The Women of Brewster Place (1989). Although the big screen did not offer the same consistent quality following his breakthrough with Sounder, he nevertheless turned in strong roles in Conrack (1974), Huckleberry Finn (1974), A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich (1978) (again with Ms. Tyson), Damnation Alley (1977), Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) and White Dog (1982). Paul never achieved the promise of a Sidney Poitier-like stardom and his roles diminished in size. Relegated to character roles, he still appeared in such quality television as Breathing Lessons (1994), although he was not the major focus. After two nominations, he finally won the Emmy for a guest performance as a judge on Picket Fences (1992). Paul's showier work at this period of time included the film Catfish in Black Bean Sauce (1999) and a surprise cross-dressing cameo as Aunt Matilda in Relax... It's Just Sex (1998). On stage, he graced such productions as \"Richard III\" (at New York's Lincoln Center Theatre), \"Othello\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"The Seagull\", \"A Few Good Men\", \"Happy Endings\" and \"Checkmates\", which became his sole Broadway credit. Paul also served as Artist in Residence at the University of Hawaii and subsequently at the University of California at Santa Barbara. In his final years, he narrated the A&E crime series City Confidential (1998), appeared as a teacher in a television adaptation of his earlier success The Wonderful World of Disney: Sounder (2003), and enjoyed a recurring role as Sam for many years on the series Touched by an Angel (1994). Suffering from obesity and diabetes in later life, Paul Winfield passed away from a heart attack at age 64 in 2004, and was survived by a sister, Patricia. His longtime companion of 30 years, set designer and architect Charles Gillan Jr. predeceased him by two years.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MDUxMjk1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTUwNDM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934902","name":"Paul Winfield","idIMDB":"nm0934902"},"actorId":"nm0934902","character":"Lieutenant Ed Traxler","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000958","main":true},{"actorName":"Lance Henriksen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000448","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkwOTMyMDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4NTUyMg@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 May 1940","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Lance James Henriksen","height":"5' 10¼\" (1.79 m)","bio":"An intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (The X-Files (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\". Henriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien: Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra. James Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), then used him again in The Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Mort ou vif (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998). In addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkwOTMyMDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4NTUyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000448","name":"Lance Henriksen","idIMDB":"nm0000448"},"actorId":"nm0000448","character":"Detective Hal Vukovich","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000939","main":true},{"actorName":"Rick Rossovich","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001685","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2NDMwMzg1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY4Nzg5Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 August 1957","placeOfBirth":" Palo Alto, California, USA","birthName":"Frederic Enrico Rossovich","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Rick Rossovich, considered one of the nicest people to work with, is also a devoted family man.

She was born on February 10, 1958 in Burbank, California, the daughter of Eric, a scientist, and Rita, an operetta singer. Bess was raised in Woodland Hills, California, and was a competitive ice skater as a pre-teen. At age 13, she began studying drama with Austrian actor Francis Lederer. She attended William Howard Taft High School and starred in multiple theater productions and was also active in summer productions and drama competitions with other San Fernando Valley actors Mare Winningham, Val Kilmer and Kevin Spacey. At age 18, Bess was cast in the San Francisco production of \"The Great American Backstage Musical\". British actor Anthony Andrews saw Bess in the production and decided to produce the show in London and brought her over as the sole American in the show. After returning from England, Bess became interested in aerobics and because of her dance and musical background, she quickly became one of the most popular instructors in Brentwood, California. It was there that she came to the attention of the director who was developing an exercise show :20 Minute Workout (1982). The show was filmed entirely in Toronto, Canada and Bess is often credited for putting TV aerobics on the map. Even though the show was only produced for two seasons, the program ran in international syndication for over 10 years. Bess was cast as Sarah Connor's roommate Ginger Ventura in The Terminator (1984), in which she performed her own stunts in the film. Bess continued to work in theater throughout her career, performing in a various Los Angeles productions, including Charles Busch's \"Psycho Beach Party\". In August 2010, she gave an interview to the Terminator Fans website in which she confirms that she has attended the occasional Comic-Con convention (Burbank and Chicago).

He settled in Los Angeles in the mid-1950s, where he was noticed by producer/director Roger Corman, who cast him in most of his low-budget films, usually playing unlikeable sorts, such as a vacuum-cleaner salesman in Not of This Earth (1957). His most memorable role would have to be that of the mentally unstable, busboy/beatnik artist Walter Paisley, whose clay sculptures are suspiciously lifelike in A Bucket of Blood (1959) (a rare starring role for him), and he is also fondly remembered for his supporting role as the flower-eating Vurson Fouch in Corman's legendary The Little Shop of Horrors (1960). Miller spent the next 20 years working in Corman productions, and starting in the late 1970s was often cast in films by director Joe Dante, appearing in credited and uncredited walk-on bits as quirky chatterboxes, and stole every scene he appeared in. He has played many variations on his famous Walter Paisley role, such as a diner owner (Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)) or a janitor (Chopping Mall (1986)). One of his best bits is the funny occult-bookshop owner in The Howling (1981). Being short (so he never played a romantic lead or a threatening villain) with wavy hair, long sideburns, a pointed nose and a face as trustworthy as a used-car dealer's, he was, and is to this day, an immediately recognizable character actor whose one-scene appearances in countless movies and TV shows guarantee audience applause.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDM1OTY4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ3NDcyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588241","name":"Dick Miller","idIMDB":"nm0588241"},"actorId":"nm0588241","character":"Pawn Shop Clerk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0382665","main":true},{"actorName":"Shawn Schepps","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0770974","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 July 1961","placeOfBirth":" USA","bio":"Shawn Schepps was born on July 25, 1961 in the USA.

He was the son of Mary Lou (Gray) and John Lane Paxton, a businessman and actor (as John Paxton). Bill moved to Los Angeles, California at age eighteen, where he found work in the film industry as a set dresser for Roger Corman's New World Pictures. He made his film debut in the Corman film Crazy Mama (1975), directed by Jonathan Demme. Moving to New York, Paxton studied acting under Stella Adler at New York University. After landing a small role in Stripes (1981), he found steady work in low-budget films and television. He also directed, wrote and produced award-winning short films including Fish Heads (1980), which aired on Saturday Night Live (1975). His first appearance in a James Cameron film was a small role in The Terminator (1984), followed by his very memorable performance as Private Hudson in Aliens (1986) and as the nomadic vampire Severen in Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark (1987). Bill also appeared in John Hughes' Weird Science (1985), as Wyatt Donnelly's sadistic older brother Chet. Although he continued to work steadily in film and television, his big break did not come until his lead role in the critically acclaimed film-noir One False Move (1992). This quickly led to strong supporting roles as Wyatt Earp's naive younger brother Morgan in Tombstone (1993) and as Fred Haise, one of the three astronauts, in Apollo 13 (1995), as well as in James Cameron's offering True Lies (1994). Bill died on February 25, 2017, in Los Angeles, from complications following heart surgery. He was 61.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2NTQwOTAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNjYwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000200","name":"Bill Paxton","nicknames":["Wild Bill","Knuckles"],"idIMDB":"nm0000200"},"actorId":"nm0000200","character":"Punk Leader","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000936","main":true},{"actorName":"Brad Rearden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714087","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Brad Rearden is an actor, known for The Terminator (1984), A Family Upside Down (1978) and The Silent Scream (1979).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0714087","name":"Brad Rearden","idIMDB":"nm0714087"},"actorId":"nm0714087","character":"Punk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0474054","main":true},{"actorName":"Brian Thompson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0859921","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MDExNzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc2NDYyNA@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 August 1959","placeOfBirth":" Ellensburg, Washington, USA","birthName":"Brian Thompson","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Brian Earl Thompson was born on August 28, 1959 in Ellensburg, Washington. Raised on the Columbia River in Longview, he learned the value of academics and athletics, as the son of two teachers and the second of six siblings. His interest in acting was first sparked during his senior year of high school with the role of the Russian ballet instructor, Boris Kolenkhov, in the comedy \"You Can't Take it With You\". Under the pretense of attending Central Washington University to play football and study business management, he quietly auditioned for every available play, treading the boards for a dozen school productions, from musicals and operas to the more lighthearted fare of Neil Simon. Earning a scholarship to the University of California-Irvine, he sailed through a three-year Master of Fine Arts program, learning from such theatrical luminaries as playwright Edward Albee, Robert Cohen and Jerzy Grotoswski, and supplementing his education through work with the Colorado Shakespeare Festival. He began to audition theatrically before graduation, and by that time, he had his SAG card, an agent and five professional credits, including James Cameron's The Terminator (1984), where he and Bill Paxton's clothes were forcibly removed by a naked Arnold Schwarzenegger. About a year after Arnold took Brian's clothes, Sylvester Stallone wanted a hack at Brian as well. After seven auditions and a screen test, Brian earned the right to get impaled on a meat hook, then burned alive, Stallone's Cobra (1986). This began a string of credits that has left Thompson in and around some of Hollywood's biggest and most projects. Brian has tackled two superhero roles as well: first, Conan the Librarian (1999), starring red in the title role, a PBS special to encourage kids to read. He also earned critical acclaim playing the larger-than-life role of Hercules in Jason and the Argonauts (2000). Probably the first role that demanded use of his classical background as well as his 6' 3\" muscled frame. Brian says that no gym can claim him as a member, and that his physique is kept honed by years of windsurfing and kitesurfing. Taking a curiously \"musical\" approach to his craft, the actor continually seeks fresh rhythms for each new role. Brian verifies his well-rounded nature with a resume that lists such special skills as martial arts (black belt Hapkido), piano and sushi rolling. He currently resides at home with his son Jordan and daughter Daphne.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MDExNzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc2NDYyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0859921","name":"Brian Thompson","idIMDB":"nm0859921"},"actorId":"nm0859921","character":"Punk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0474054","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0088247","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247","business":{"budget":{"money":"$6,400,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$4,020,663","country":"USA","day":"28","month":"10","year":"1984","remarks":"1,005 Screens"}],"gross":[{"money":"$38,371,200","country":"USA","day":"27","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":""},{"money":"$37,778,146","country":"USA","day":"20","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":""},{"money":"$37,168,698","country":"USA","day":"13","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":""},{"money":"$35,016,088","country":"USA","day":"06","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":""},{"money":"$34,004,606","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$32,838,673","country":"USA","day":"16","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$31,318,775","country":"USA","day":"09","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$29,113,732","country":"USA","day":"02","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$25,220,233","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$18,925,483","country":"USA","day":"18","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$14,504,576","country":"USA","day":"11","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$9,780,393","country":"USA","day":"04","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$4,020,663","country":"USA","day":"28","month":"10","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$1,314,997 (UK)","country":"","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},{"money":"$40,000,000 (Worldwide)","country":"except","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},{"money":"$436,055 (Germany)","country":"","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null},{"money":"€1,928,803","country":"Spain","day":"20","month":"12","year":"2002","remarks":""},{"money":"SEK","country":"2,690,178","day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":null}],"weekendGross":[{"money":"$352,169","country":"USA","day":"27","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":"408 Screens"},{"money":"$377,785","country":"USA","day":"20","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":"533 Screens"},{"money":"$521,060","country":"USA","day":"13","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":"595 Screens"},{"money":"$702,042","country":"USA","day":"06","month":"01","year":"1985","remarks":"643 Screens"},{"money":"$722,260","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":"551 Screens"},{"money":"$955,973","country":"USA","day":"16","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":"938 Screens"},{"money":"$1,439,000","country":"USA","day":"09","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$2,975,716","country":"USA","day":"02","month":"12","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$3,934,127","country":"USA","day":"25","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$2,848,258","country":"USA","day":"18","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":""},{"money":"$3,191,628","country":"USA","day":"11","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":"960 Screens"},{"money":"$4,219,463","country":"USA","day":"04","month":"11","year":"1984","remarks":"1,112 Screens"},{"money":"$4,020,663","country":"USA","day":"28","month":"10","year":"1984","remarks":"1,005 Screens"}],"admissions":[{"money":"1,212,966","country":"Spain","day":"20","month":"12","year":"2002","remarks":""}],"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"08","month":"02","year":"1984","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"12","month":"05","year":"1984","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":"Copyright ©1984 Cinema'84, A Greenberg Brothers Partnership.
