He is the son of Harriet T. (Koch), a psychiatric nurse, and Edwin A. Carell, an electrical engineer. His mother is of Polish descent and his father is of Italian and German ancestry (Steve's grandfather had changed the surname from \"Caroselli\" to \"Carrell\"). He was educated at The Fenn School, an all-boys private school in Concord, Massachusetts, then at Middlesex School in Concord. After graduating from Denison University in Granville, Ohio, he moved to Chicago where he taught an improvisational comedy class and performed with The Second City troupe, alongside Stephen Colbert. Carell made his film debut as \"Tesio\" in Curly Sue (1991). In 1996, he became a cast member of The Dana Carvey Show (1996), and provided the voice for Gary, opposite Colbert in \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\". This animated short series produced by Robert Smigel continued on Saturday Night Live (1975), but Carell has joked that he auditioned for SNL and lost the job to Will Ferrell. Carell made a number of guest appearances on such shows as Come to Papa (2004), Just Shoot Me! (1997), and Watching Ellie (2002), before landing a regular stint as a correspondent on The Daily Show (1996) from 1999 until 2005. Carell played Evan Baxter opposite Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty (2003), and Uncle Arthur opposite Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell in Bewitched (2005). He broke out as a leading man after starring in the summer box-office hit The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), which he also co-wrote; the film was chosen as one of the Top Ten movies of 2006 by the American Film Institute. He next starred in the critically acclaimed Little Miss Sunshine (2006), an indie dark comedy which became a surprise hit and earned four Oscar nominations, and won two (Best Supporting Actor for Alan Arkin and Best Screenplay for Michael Arndt). In 2007, Carell reprised his role as Evan Baxter, filling Jim Carrey's leading-man shoes as a politician asked by God to build a giant ark in Evan Almighty (2007), the second installment of the \"Almighty\" franchise, co-starring Lauren Graham and Morgan Freeman. In 2008, he re-united with Jim Carrey in the highly successful animation hit Horton Hears a Who! (2008), then appeared as Agent Maxwell Smart in the popular comedy Get Smart (2008). Throughout this time, Carell maintained a successful career in television, starring as Michael Scott in the American remake of the Britain's existential comedy, The Office (2005). He received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in Television Comedy for this leading role in 2006, and earned both Emmy and Golden Globe nominations each consecutive show until he departed in 2011. In 2010, Carell announced he was leaving \"The Office\" to concentrate on his film career, and has made steady appearance in such films as Date Night (2010), Despicable Me (2010), Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), and Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012). Carell's most recent roles are the comedies Despicable Me 2 (2013), Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013), and Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (2014), and the drama Foxcatcher (2014). Steve Carell has been enjoying a happy family life with his wife, actress Nancy Carell, whom he met when she was a student in an improv class he was teaching at The Second City comedy troupe in Chicago. The couple have two children, daughter Elisabeth (born in May 2001), and son John (born in June 2004). Steve Carell lives with his family in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMjkzNzA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyNjU3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136797","name":"Steve Carell","idIMDB":"nm0136797"},"actorId":"nm0136797","character":"John du Pont","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0288596","main":true},{"actorName":"Channing Tatum","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1475594","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4OTI3Mzg2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAxNTU3OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 April 1980","placeOfBirth":" Cullman, Alabama, USA","birthName":"Channing Matthew Tatum","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Channing Tatum was born in a small town, Cullman, Alabama, 50 miles north of Birmingham. He is the son of Kay (Faust), an airline worker, and Glenn Matthew Tatum, who worked in construction. Growing up, he was full of energy and somewhat troublesome, so his parents decided to enroll him in different sports such as track and field, baseball, soccer, and football to keep him out of trouble. In the ninth grade he was sent to Catholic school. It was there that he discovered his passion for football and his hopes became centered on earning an athletic college scholarship. Channing's goal was finally met, and in his senior year in high school, he was recruited and earned a full athletic college scholarship to a school in West Virginia. Tatum is also skilled in Kung Fu and in Gor-Chor Kung Fu, a form of martial arts, in which he has earned belts. Channing later left college and, in the meantime, worked as a construction worker, a stripper, a mortgage broker and salesman. He has modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch, Nautica, Gap, Aeropostale, Emporio Armani, and has been featured in television commercials for American Eagle, Pepsi, and some very popular Mountain Dew commercials.

His father's ancestry is Italian, and his mother is of half French-Canadian and half Italian descent. Mark moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he lived out most of his teenage years. Following high school, Mark moved with his family to San Diego and soon migrated north, eventually settling in Los Angeles. He took classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory and subsequently co-founded the Orpheus Theatre Company, an Equity-Waiver establishment, where he worked in nearly every capacity. From acting, writing, directing and producing to running the lights and building sets while building his resume. Bartending for nearly nine years to make ends meet and ready to give it all up, a chance meeting and resulting collaboration with playwright/screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan changed everything. Ruffalo won NY success in Lonergan's play \"This Is Our Youth\", which led to the male lead in Lonergan's film You Can Count on Me (2000), playing the ne'er-do-well brother of Laura Linney. The performance drew rave reviews and invited comparisons to an early Marlon Brando. Notable roles in The Last Castle (2001), XX/XY (2002), and Windtalkers (2002) followed, although in 2002 Ruffalo was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor. Though the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery led to a period of partial facial paralysis, from which he fully recovered. In 2003, Ruffalo scored leading roles alongside two popular female stars, playing a police detective opposite Meg Ryan in In the Cut (2003) and the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow in the comedy View from the Top (2003). Though both films were high-profile box office disappointments, Ruffalo went on to four notable (if highly disparate) films in 2004 - We Don't Live Here Anymore (2004), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), 13 Going on 30 (2004), and Collateral (2004) - which solidified his ability to be both a popular leading man and an acclaimed ensemble player in either comedy or drama. After 2004, Ruffalo was consistently at work, with leads in popular Hollywood films and independent productions that continued to solidify him as one of film's most consistently strong actors: Just Like Heaven (2005), Les fous du roi (2006), Zodiac (2007), Reservation Road (2007), and The Brothers Bloom (2008). In 2010 Ruffalo achieved something of a breakthrough, by directing the indie film Sympathy for Delicious (2010), which won him the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and co-starring as the sperm-donor father to lesbian couple Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in The Kids Are All Right (2010). His role in the idiosyncratic domestic comedy/drama earned him Academy Award, Independent Spirit Award, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actor. High-profile roles in Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island (2010) and 'Kenneth Longeran''s long-delayed Margaret (2011) followed before Ruffalo's appearance as Dr. Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, in Joss Whedon's blockbuster The Avengers (2012). Garnering highly positive reviews for a role in which actors Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not find success in previous films made Ruffalo a box office star in addition to a critically-acclaimed actor. He is expected to reprise the role in the upcoming 2015 sequel, and reunited with former co-star Gywneth Paltrow in the sex-addiction comedy-drama Thanks for Sharing (2012); Ruffalo also will take the lead in Ryan Murphy's adaptation of Larry Kramer's AIDS-drama play The Normal Heart (2014). Ruffalo has been married to actress Sunrise Coigney since 2000; the couple have three children, a son and two daughters.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MjMwNjAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyNDg1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0749263","name":"Mark Ruffalo","idIMDB":"nm0749263"},"actorId":"nm0749263","character":"David Schultz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0288595","main":true},{"actorName":"Sienna Miller","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1092227","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2MjYyNjk3MjVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDIxOTkwNjI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 December 1981","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Sienna Rose Miller","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Sienna Rose Diana Miller was born in New York City, but was raised in London, England. Her father, Edwin \"Ed\" Miller, who is American-born, is an investment banker and a dealer in Modern Chinese paintings. Her mother, Josephine \"Jo\" Miller, was a South African model and a personal assistant to David Bowie; she went on to manage the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York City, and then became a yoga instructor. Sienna has one older sister, Savannah Miller. The family moved to Chelsea, London, when Sienna was 18-months-old. Sienna spent her weekends horse riding at her godmother's farmhouse in Wiltshire. When Sienna was age 6, her parents got divorced. Sienna and Savannah moved to Parsons Green with their mother, who was also being treated for breast cancer. Sienna's father remarried three times and moved to the Virgin Islands. At age 8, she moved away to Heathfield boarding school in Ascot, where she enjoyed playing Lacrosse and acting. Sienna went back to New York City, when she turned 18, and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. Following this, she traveled, modeled, did theater and took small roles in films. She landed a role as a flirtatious model in a BBC sitcom, Bedtime (2001). Her breakout film role was as Daniel Craig's love interest in Matthew Vaughn's Layer Cake (2004). Sienna's film credits include Alfie (2004) (Susan Sarandon, Jude Law), Casanova (2005) (Heath Ledger), Factory Girl (2006) (Hayden Christensen, Guy Pearce) and Interview (2007) (Steve Buscemi). She received a British Independent Film Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Edge of Love (2008), in which she performed opposite fellow British actress Keira Knightley, with whom she formed a great friendship. In the same year, she was also nominated for the BAFTA Orange Rising Star award and, in 2006, was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her role as Katya in Interview (2007). Sienna has also carved out a notable theatre career, with credits including the role of Celia in the Young Vic production of \"As You Like It\" - her theatrical West End debut - opposite Helen McCrory and Dominic West, and the Broadway production of Patrick Marber's \"After Miss Julie\", in which she played opposite Jonny Lee Miller. Sienna's most recent stage performance was in Terence Rattigan's critically-acclaimed \"Flare Path\", directed by Sir Trevor Nunn, held at London's Theatre Royal Haymarket.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2MjYyNjk3MjVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDIxOTkwNjI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1092227","name":"Sienna Miller","idIMDB":"nm1092227"},"actorId":"nm1092227","character":"Nancy Schultz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0443161","main":true},{"actorName":"Vanessa Redgrave","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000603","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MjE0OTgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3ODMwMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 January 1937","placeOfBirth":" Greenwich, London, England, UK","height":"5' 11\" (1.81 m)","bio":"On January 30, 1937, renowned theatre actor Michael Redgrave was performing in a production of Hamlet in London. During the curtain call, the show's lead, Laurence Olivier, announced to the audience: \"tonight a great actress was born\". This was in reference to his co-star's newborn daughter, Vanessa Redgrave. Vanessa was born in Greenwich, London, to Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, both thespians. Three quarters of a century after her birth (despite numerous ups and down) this rather forward expectation has definitely been lived up to with an acclaimed actress that has won (among many others) an Academy Award, two Emmys, two Golden Globes, two Cannes Best Actress awards, a Tony, a Screen Actors Guild award, a Laurence Olivier theatre award and a BAFTA fellowship. Growing up with such celebrated theatrical parents, great expectations were put on both herself, her brother Corin Redgrave and sister Lynn Redgrave at an early age. Shooting up early and finally reaching a height just short of 6 foot, Redgrave initially had plans to dance and perform ballet as a profession. However she settled on acting and entered the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1954 and four years later made her West End debut. In the decade of the 1960s she developed and progressed to become one of the most noted young stars of the English stage and then film. Performances on the London stage included the classics: 'A Touch of Sun', 'Coriolanus', 'A Midsummer's Night Dream', 'All's Well that Ends Well', 'As You Like It', 'The Lady from the Sea', 'The Seagull' and many others. By the mid 1960s, she had booked various film roles and matured into a striking beauty with a slim, tall frame and attractive face. In 1966 she made her big screen debut as the beautiful ex-wife of a madman in an Oscar nominated performance in the oddball comedy Morgan! (1966), as well as the enigmatic woman in a public park in desperate need of a photographer's negatives in the iconic Blow-Up (1966) and briefly appeared in an unspoken part of Anne Boleyn in the Best Picture winner of the year A Man for All Seasons (1966). She managed to originate the title role in \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" the same year on the London stage (which was then adapted for the big screen a few years later, but Maggie Smith was cast instead and managed to win an Oscar for her performance). Her follow up work saw her play the lead in the box office hit adaptation Camelot (1967), a film popular with audiences but dismissed by critics, and her second Academy Award nominated performance as Isadora Duncan in the critically praised Isadora (1968). Her rise in popularity on film also coincided with her public political involvement, she was one of the lead faces in protesting against the Vietnam war and lead a famous march on the US embassy, was arrested during a Ban-the-Bomb demonstration, publicly supported Yasar Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and fought for various other human rights and particularly left wing causes. Despite her admirably independent qualities, most of her political beliefs weren't largely supported by the public. In 1971 after 3 films back to back, Redgrave suffered a miscarriage (it would have been her fourth, after Natasha Richardson, Joely Richardson and Carlo Gabriel Nero) and a break up with her then partner and father of her son, Franco Nero. This was around the same time her equally political brother Corin introduced her to the Workers Revolutionary Party, a group who aimed to destroy capitalism and abolish the monarchy. Her film career began to suffer and take the back seat as she became more involved with the party, twice unsuccessfully attempting to run as a party member for parliament, only obtaining a very small percentage of votes. In terms of her film career at the time, she was given probably the smallest part in the huge ensemble who-dunnit hit, Murder on the Orient Express (1974) and given another thankless small part as Lola Deveraux in the Sherlock Holmes adventure The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976). After a celebrated Broadway debut, she created further controversy in 1977 with her involvement in two films, firstly in Julia (1977) where she acted opposite Jane Fonda as a woman fighting Nazi oppression and narrated and featured in the documentary The Palestinian (1977) where she famously danced holding a Kalashnikov rifle. She publicly stated her condemnation of what she termed \"Zionist hudlums\", which outraged Jewish groups and as a result a screening of her documentary was bombed and Redgrave was personally threatened by the Jewish Defense League (JDL). Julia (1977) happened to be a huge critical success and Redgrave herself was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, but Jewish support groups demanded her nomination to be dropped and at the event of the Academy Awards burned effigies of Redgrave and protested and picketed. Redgrave was forced to enter the event via a rear entrance to avoid harm and when she won the award she famously remarked on the frenzy causes as \"Zionist hoodlums\" which caused the audience to audibly gasp and boo. The speech reached newspapers the next morning and her reputation was further damaged. It came as a surprise when CBS hired her for the part of real life Nazi camp survivor Fania Fenelon in Playing for Time (1980), despite more controversy and protesting (Fenelon herself didn't even want Redgrave to portray her) she won an Emmy for the part and the film was one of the highest rating programs of the year. Her follow up film work to her Oscar had been mostly low key but successful, performances in films such as Yanks (1979), Agatha (1979), The Bostonians (1984), Wetherby (1985) and Prick Up Your Ears (1987) further cemented her reputation as a fine actress and she received various accolades and nominations. However mainly in the 1980s, she focused on TV films and high budget mini-series as well as theatre in both London and New York. She made headlines in 1984 when she sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra for $5 million for wrongful cancellation of her contract because of her politics (she also stated her salary was significantly reduced in Agatha (1979) for the same reason). She became more mainstream in the 1990s where she appeared in a string of high profile films but the parts often underused Redgrave's abilities or they were small cameos/5-minute parts. Highlights included Howards End (1992), Little Odessa (1994), Mission: Impossible (1996) and Cradle Will Rock (1999), as well as her leading lady parts in A Month by the Lake (1995) and Mrs Dalloway (1997). In 2003 she finally won the coveted Tony award for her performance in 'The Long Day's Journey Into Night' and followed up with another two Tony nominated performances on Broadway, her one woman show 'The Year of Magical Thinking' in 2007 and 'Driving Miss Daisy' in 2010 which not only was extended due to high demand, but was also transferred to the West End for an additional three months in 2011. Vanessa continues to lend her name to causes and has been notable for donating huge amounts of her own money for her various beliefs. She has publicly opposed the war in Iraq, campaigned for the closure of Guantanamo Bay, supported the rights of gays and lesbians as well as AIDs research and many other issues. She released her autobiography in 1993 and a few years later she was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She also famously declined the invitation to be made a Dame for her services as an actress. Many have wondered the possible heights her career could have reached if it wasn't for her outspoken views, but being a celebrity and the artificial lifestyle usually attached doesn't seem to interest Redgrave in the slightest. Vanessa has worked with all three of her children professionally on numerous occasions (her eldest daughter, Natasha Richardson tragically died at the age of 45 due to a skiing accident) and in her mid 70s she still works regularly on television, film and theatre, delivering time and time again great performances.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MjE0OTgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3ODMwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000603","name":"Vanessa Redgrave","idIMDB":"nm0000603"},"actorId":"nm0000603","character":"Jean du Pont","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anthony Michael Hall","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MjM2MjAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2NjQwNA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 April 1968","placeOfBirth":" West Roxbury, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Anthony Michael Hall was born in West Roxbury, Massachusetts. His parents are Mercedes Hall, an actress-blues and jazz singer, and Larry Hall, who owned an auto body shop. His stepfather is a show-business manager. His sister, Mary Christian, is also a performer. He has Irish and Italian ancestry. Hall's given name was Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall, but he adopted the Anthony Michael moniker upon finding that another Michael Hall was already a member of the Screen Actors' Guild. Hall began acting in commercials at the age of seven, and his breakthrough role was as Rusty Griswold in National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) alongside Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Following the success of National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Hall entered the defining period of his career, starring in three John Hughes classics: Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985) and Weird Science (1985). Wanting to avoid being typecast, Hall turned down roles in two subsequent 1986 Hughes films, Pretty in Pink (1986) and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). His early television credits include the Emmy Award-winning \"The Gold Bug\", in which he played the young Edgar Allan Poe, as well as the TV movie Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (1982), and specials \"The Body Human\" and \"Orphans, Waifs and Wards\". On stage, he appeared in the Lincoln Center Festival's production of \"St. Joan of the Microphone\". Following a one-year stint on Saturday Night Live (1975), excessive drinking and partying threatened to sidetrack Hall's career. However, he was able to regain control and has been sober since 1990, the year he played the role of Jim in Edward Scissorhands (1990). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, he starred as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in the television movie Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999). Since that time, Hall has focused on television work, including an 81-episode run on Stephen King's The Dead Zone (2002), but has managed to take on film projects as well, including the role of Mike Engel in The Dark Knight (2008). In addition to acting, Hall has also pursued his musical talents, as songwriter and lead singer of his band, Hall of Mirrors, which was formed in 1998. Hall helps at-risk youth via the Anthony Michael Hall Literacy Club and lives in Los Angeles, Caifornia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MjM2MjAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2NjQwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309","name":"Anthony Michael Hall","idIMDB":"nm0001309"},"actorId":"nm0001309","character":"Jack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Guy Boyd","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0101777","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcwMzU4MzM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM2MDg0ODE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 April 1943","placeOfBirth":" Du Quoin, Illinois, USA","bio":"Guy Boyd has been a reliable and renowned supporting actor since his film debut in Between the Lines (1977).

He got a part in The Bear (1984), with Gary Busey and then a role in a TV movie called Poison Ivy (1985), with 'Michael J. Fox', 'Adam Baldwin' and Nancy McKeon. Work dried up until Brett started a fantastic run of luck in which he worked solidly thru the 90s. He played in due TV shows such as I'll Fly Away (1991), In the Heat of the Night (1988), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), and many more. Theatrical Films included Forrest Gump (1994), Edward Scissorhands (1990), Kalifornia (1993), Passenger 57 (1992), From the Earth to the Moon (1998), The Waterboy (1998) and most recently as a co-star in Remember the Titans (2000) in which he played Coach Tyrell opposite Denzel Washington and 'Will Patton'. Brett has a guest appearance on the television show, Sheena (2000). The episode, 'Stranded in the Jungle' will be shown in 2002. Brett has over 75 credits for TV and Film, and at least that many credits for the stage. He has become a Councilor at Large with SAG to get more closely involved with the unusual politics and negotiations with producers in LA and NY.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY5NDU2MjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQyNTQwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723365","name":"Brett Rice","idIMDB":"nm0723365"},"actorId":"nm0723365","character":"Fred Cole","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jackson Frazer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5370784","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE2NDc3MjYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE2NTE5NzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Jackson Frazer was born in Pittsburgh in 2006.

She began acting shortly thereafter at the age of 4. Samara was called upon to attend her first audition ever in front of long-time casting director, Donna Belajac, who immediately recognized young Samara's unique talent. That first audition led to her being cast alongside Steve Carrell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo in the highly critically-acclaimed-Oscar-nominated feature film, Foxcatcher (2014) directed by Bennett Miller (Capote, Moneyball). Samara continued her feature film career when she was cast and sent to Pittsburgh, PA to shoot The Last Witch Hunter (2015), starring Vin Diesel and Elijah Wood, as well as the Oscar-nominated feature film Concussion (2015), starring Will Smith, Luke Wilson, and Alec Baldwin. Samara continued pursuing her acting career in the south, but decided to dip her toes in the Los Angeles waters in 2016, which proved to be quite successful. Within mere weeks of arrival, she signed with a top agency and within 3 weeks, landed a supporting role as Bee Mullins in the upcoming horror sequel, Annabelle 2 (2017), alongside Miranda Otto and Anthony LaPaglia, directed by David Sandberg (Lights Out), and produced by James Wan (The Conjuring 1 & 2, Insidious, Furious 7).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgzY2VlMTMtMmZjYi00YTY4LTlkYWUtZjk0ZGEzOGQyNWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzczNTA4NTM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5343317","name":"Samara Lee","idIMDB":"nm5343317"},"actorId":"nm5343317","character":"Danielle Schultz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Francis J.
