At the age of 15 he was forced to leave school in order to earn a living so he could support his mother and younger brother, Thomas Tuttle. His music background got him work with comedy teams and a burlesque orchestra and, finally, his own band. At age 18 he moved to Hollywood, California. He eventually ended up working at Fox studios. He became an apprentice to Jack Dawn, head of makeup at Twentieth-Century Pictures. Seven months later Twentieth Century closed down for the summer in 1934 and Bill went to MGM to continue his apprenticeship. Fox hired Bill as a makeup artist after seeing the work he had done at MGM. He worked on three films for Fox before returning to MGM, and made it his home for 35 years. For eight years he worked as an assistant to Jack Dawn (by then head makeup artist at MGM) and, after Jack retired, he became the head of the department for over 20 years. William Tuttle and Charles H. Schram both worked on The Time Machine (1960). Bill had taken a trip to the San Diego Zoo and got the idea to use the fur of an East African species of monkey for the fur of the Morlocks. He won an honorary Oscar in April 1965 for his work on George Pal's 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (1964). He has taught at the USC film school and created his own line of cosmetics, Custom Color Cosmetics.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878369","name":"William Tuttle","nicknames":["King of the Duplictators"],"idIMDB":"nm0878369"},"actorId":"nm0878369","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wayne Thomas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0859640","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 August 1931","placeOfBirth":" Oakland, California, USA","birthName":"Michael Wayne Thomas","bio":"Wayne Thomas was born on August 13, 1931 in Oakland, California, USA as Michael Wayne Thomas.
