As a child, she & her parents moved to San Francisco, California, where she graduated from high school in 1923. She then moved to Los Angeles where she enrolled in a secretarial school. She got a job at a shoe store for the princely sum of $18 per week. However, since L.A. was the land of stars and studios, she wanted to try her hand at acting. She managed to land unbilled bit parts in several feature films and comedy shorts. She bided her time, believing \"Good things come to those who wait.\" She didn't have to wait too long, either. In 1926, at the age of 20, she turned in a superb performance as Anna Burger in The Johnstown Flood (1926). The Hollywood moguls knew they had a top star on their hands and cast her in several other leading roles that year, including The Shamrock Handicap (1926), The Blue Eagle (1926), The Midnight Kiss (1926) and The Return of Peter Grimm (1926). The next year she turned in acclaimed performances in two classic films, 7th Heaven (1927) and Sunrise (1927). Based on the strength of those two films plus Street Angel (1928), Janet received the very first Academy Award for best actress. This was the first and only time an actress won the Oscar for multiple roles. When \"talkies\" replaced silent films, Janet was one of the few who made a successful transition, not only because of her great acting ability but for her charming voice as well. Without a doubt, Janet had already lived a true rags-to-riches story. Throughout the mid-1930s she was the top drawing star at theaters. She turned in grand performances in several otherwise undistinguished films. Then came A Star Is Born (1937). She was very convincing as Vicki Lester (aka Esther Blodgett), struggling actress trying for the big time. Told by the receptionist at Central casting \"You know what your chances are? One in a hundred thousand,\" Esther/Vicki replies, \"But maybe--I'm that one.\" For her outstanding performance she was nominated for another Oscar, but lost to Luise Rainer's performance in The Good Earth (1937), her second in as many tries. After appearing in The Young in Heart (1938), Janet didn't appear in another film until 1957's Bernardine (1957). Her last performance was in a Broadway version of Harold and Maude. Although the play was a flop, Janet's performance salvaged it to any degree - she still had what it took to entertain the public. On September 14, 1984, Janet passed away from pneumonia in Palm Springs, California, at the age of 77.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzE4Nzk0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjg0NzU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0310980","name":"Janet Gaynor","nicknames":["Lolly"],"idIMDB":"nm0310980"},"actorId":"nm0310980","character":"Molly Carr","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0496240","main":true},{"actorName":"Charles Farrell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268190","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMDIyNTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTMzMjM2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 August 1900","placeOfBirth":" Onset Bay, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Charles David Farrell","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Popular Hollywood leading man of late silents and early talkies.

It's easy to tell she was a favorite in the 1930s. In addition to having acting talent and screen presence, she could sing and dance, which made her fantastic in musical comedies on stage and screen. In her early career, she was teamed up with Thelma White, another popular performer and actress, and together they became a popular singing and dancing duo known as the \"White Sisters\".","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925175","name":"Marjorie White","idIMDB":"nm0925175"},"actorId":"nm0925175","character":"Bea Nichols","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"El Brendel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0107151","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ODM2MTc1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxMTIyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 March 1890","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Elmer Goodfellow Brendel","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"El Brendel was born on March 25, 1890 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA as Elmer Goodfellow Brendel.

A former beauty contest winner, she began in show business as a nightclub singer and songwriter. Possessed of a strong, bluesy voice, she drifted towards the musical stage, eventually appearing in both the Broadway and screen versions of the musical Sunnyside Up (1929). She was also cast to good effect alongside Sue Carol in Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 (1929). Billed as 'Sharon Lynn', she had a few more minor leads in the late 1920s, then, after joining Fox, found herself relegated to the supporting cast. Even adding the extra 'e' to her surname didn't help. For the remainder of the 1930's, Sharon Lynne played assorted 'other women', 'fickle dancers', and the like. Her last effective role was as Lola Marcel, an excellent menace to Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, in Way Out West (1937). Finding decent roles ever harder to come by, Sharon had quit the movies by the end of the decade. She was married twice, first to Benjamin Glazer, an associate producer at Paramount; secondly to John Sershen, a Beverly Hills businessman. At the time of her death in 1963, she was known as Sharon Glazer Sershen.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDc0NzUyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE3ODY3MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528800","name":"Sharon Lynn","idIMDB":"nm0528800"},"actorId":"nm0528800","character":"Jane Worth","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Frank Richardson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0724542","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 September 1898","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","bio":"Frank Richardson was born on September 6, 1898 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.
