She spent her childhood running around in the woods - until she did her first play at the age of 11. Lisa studied in the conservatory program at Carnegie Mellon University, where she graduated with honors and won the Thomas Auclair Memorial Scholarship Award for Most Promising Student Actor. She went on to study in Moscow and performed in fringe theatre in London before relocating to Los Angeles. She is best known for her roles as a series regular in three network series and for her extensive work in network television and independent film. She lives in Los Angeles. In 1998, she was cast as a series regular in the short-lived UPN's western drama Legacy (1998), alongside Brett Cullen, Melissa Leo and Tony Hale. She was then a series regular in FOX's FreakyLinks (2000) alongside Ethan Embry (her love interest), Eric Balfour, and Erika Christensen. She then continued playing guest roles in The Practice: Concealing Evidence (2003), Las Vegas: The Family Jewels (2004), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Bloodlines (2004), Monk: Mr. Monk and the Game Show (2004), Without a Trace: End Game (2005), and Strong Medicine: Clinical Risk (2005). Another regular role came in Shaun Cassidy's ABC sci-fi television series Invasion (2005), alongside William Fichtner, Eddie Cibrian (who played her fiancé), and Alexis Dziena. Unfortunately that series ended, like \"Legacy\" and \"FreakyLinks\", after the first season. After \"Invasion\", she continued playing guest roles. In 2007, she had recurring roles on Journeyman (2007) opposite Kevin McKidd and Reed Diamond as Dr. Theresa Sanchez, and on CSI: Miami (2002) as Kathleen Newberry. Other roles include in The 4400: Try the Pie (2007), Moonlight: Out of the Past (2007), Shark: One Hit Wonder (2008), The Mentalist: Miss Red (2009), NCIS: Child's Play (2009), and Scandal: Boom Goes the Dynamite (2013). She also appeared in two episodes of Halt and Catch Fire (2014). She has appeared in movies as well. In the romantic comedy Elsa & Fred (2014) she acted alongside Christopher Plummer and Shirley MacLaine, in A Magic Christmas (2014) alongside Jonathan Silverman and Burt Reynolds, and the lead in Only God Can (2015). She also has a lead in Strange Nature (2017), alongside Stephen Tobolowsky and John Hennigan. Her past feature film appearances include playing the lead in McCartney's Genes (2008), starring in the short film Pirates (2003) directed by Eric McCormack, in Carolina (2003) alongside Julia Stiles and Shirley MacLaine, and in Beat (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland and Courtney Love.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3NTIyNzU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjkwMzg1MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792209","name":"Lisa Sheridan","idIMDB":"nm0792209"},"actorId":"nm0792209","character":"Woman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2209330","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209330","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["16 min"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.4","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Athens, Georgia, USA"}],"awards":[],"votes":"8","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0139975","name":"Whitestone Motion Pictures"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:55:55"}}
