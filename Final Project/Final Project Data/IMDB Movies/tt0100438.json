Jeff says, \"Pemberton looks more like a back lot at Disney than a suburb in Southern New Jersey\". Celentano began his career as an actor while living on the east coast. Today, he is fast becoming one of the freshest new directors in Hollywood. The actor, turned writer-director has managed to effectively combine comedy, drama and action with his own personalized style. At 21, the New Jersey native left the Garden State moving to New York. There he became interested in acting, studying with legendary acting coach Stella Adler and later became a long-time student of Sanford Meisner at The Neighborhood Playhouse. As an actor, Jeff went by his mother's maiden name, Weston. He guest starred on numerous television shows from Magnum, P.I. (1980) to Dynasty (1981) and also twenty feature films including The New Age (1994) directed by Academy Award winning writer Michael Tolkin. He also was cast in Robert Altman's hit film, The Player (1992). It was during this time with Altman on set of \"The Player\" that Jeff became increasingly interested in becoming a director. He and Altman became close. Robert Altman's advice to Jeff is carried with him to all of his work today. Fascinated by the behind-the-scenes aspects of filmmaking and hopes of one day becoming a director himself, Celentano's first venture was in theatre. He co-directed and produced the South African Play \"Soweto's Burning\" at the Hudson Backstage. The critically acclaimed production earned the Los Angeles Times \"Pick of the Weekend\" for five consecutive weeks. Jeff then made his writing and directing debut with the short film Dickwad (1994) - a fast paced farce about a man's bizarre journey home from work on his only day off in seventeen years. The short, which took Celentano just less than a week to make, garnered the Gold Prize for Best Original Comedy at The Houston Film Festival, and Best Comedy Short at The Philadelphia International Film Festival. After touring the festival circuit \"Dickwad\" was brought by Showtime and the Sundance channel. The strong buzz from the film led to enormous attention from the studio and the signing with ICM. From that success Jeff received private funding to head up his own production company, \"Periscope Pictures\". His first feature under the Periscope banners (which he also co-wrote) was Under the Hula Moon (1995). This picture starred Stephen Baldwin, Emily Lloyd and Chris Penn. \"Under the Hula Moon\" is a romantic comedy, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1995 and had much with European film festivals. It premiered at The Hamburg Film Festival in Germany becoming a hit with audiences there. Hula moon was later released in theaters across the U.S. Jeff's next project was Gunshy (1998), a high-impact drama (written by Larry Gross who also wrote 48 Hrs. (1982), Streets of Fire (1984) and The Game (1997)). Gunshy's story centers around the relationship between a down-and-out journalist (William Petersen), an Irish mobster (Michael Wincott) and the girl they both love (Diane Lane). Jeff's determination, passion and attention to detail paid off once more. He won \"Best Director Award\" with \"Gunshy\", the top honor presented at The Atlantic City International Film Festival. Gunshy aced the competition with the audience favoring a simpler, more emotionally charged tale to the bigger studio entries like Brian De Palma's film Snake Eyes (1998). In total, Jeff has received 5 awards in his short career as a Director. Jeff has completed directing two films in Russia. The later, Say It in Russian (2007) a romantic thriller that stars Faye Dunaway, Rade Serbedzija, Musetta Vander and Steven Brand. Jeff recently wrapped Breaking Point (2009) a crime/drama starring Academy Award nominee, Tom Berenger, Armand Assante, and Busta Rhymes. He currently has several projects in the pipeline including a film at Sony Pictures and several independent projects. Jeff is also the Drama Director at The Performer's Academy located in Orange County, California. There Jeff oversees as well as teaches acting to children, teens, and adults. The school provides students with the opportunity to work with film directors, producers, working actors and can be seen by agents on a weekly basis. His contacts in the entertainment industry have allowed the school to flourish as a training academy - while providing agents the ability to scout and potentially represent new talent. Jeff's influences and favorite directors are The Coen Brothers, Robert Zemeckis, Ridley Scott, Terry Gilliam, Peter Greenaway, Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorsese and David Lean. One movie, The Deer Hunter (1978) is his favorite film of all time.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NjA2MzEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM2NjIzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147985","name":"Jeff Celentano","idIMDB":"nm0147985"},"actorId":"nm0147985","character":"Lance","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nita Talbot","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0847953","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQ4NDgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2NTgxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 August 1930","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Anita Sokol","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Nita Talbot was born on August 8, 1930 in New York City, New York, USA as Anita Sokol.

The exceptionally talented and versatile George \"Buck\" Flower did all this and more during a remarkably busy, diverse, and impressive career that spanned 35 years and over a 100 movies as a character actor alone. Flower was born on October 28, 1937, in the Blue Mountains of Eastern Oregon. He enlisted in the army as a teenager and enrolled at Eastern Oregon College following his military service. Flower then moved to California and attended Pasadena City College. He soon became a member of the repertory theater group The Inspiration Players and stayed with the group for twelve years. The theater company toured Alaska and all 48 continental United States. Flower first started acting in movies in the early 1970s in the blithely lowbrow soft-core outings Country Cuzzins (1970), Below the Belt (1971), and The Dirty Mind of Young Sally (1973) for legendary trash flick filmmaker Harry H. Novak. Portly and grizzled, with a rumpled face, a scraggly beard, an engagingly rough-around-the-edges demeanor, and a deep, thick, heavy drawling rumble of a throaty voice, Flower was often cast as grubby bums, sloppy drunks, grouchy old guys, and scruffy rednecks. Among the notable directors Flower appeared in countless films for are Matt Cimber, Jim Wynorski, Don Edmonds (he's in the first two notoriously nasty \"Ilsa\" movies acting under the alias C.D. LaFleure), William Lustig, Bill Rebane, David DeCoteau, Bethel Buckalew, Jack Starrett, Nick Phillips, Anthony Hickox, and Fred Olen Ray. Flower achieved his greatest popularity with his terrific contributions to a handful of John Carpenter features: he's an ill-fated fisherman in The Fog (1980); a bum in Escape from New York (1981); a crusty cook in Starman (1984); excellent as the rags-to-riches bum Drifter in They Live (1988); another bum in the \"Unleaded\" segment of the horror anthology Body Bags (1993); and a boozy high school janitor in Village of the Damned (1995). Flower's other memorable roles include the cantankerous forest-dwelling hermit Boomer in the \"Wilderness Family\" pictures, a detective in The Witch Who Came from the Sea (1976), a corrupt vice cop in The Candy Tangerine Man (1975), a machete-brandishing lunatic in Drive In Massacre (1976), an irascible old coot in Relentless (1989), a senile janitor in Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama (1988), the stern patriarch of a mountain family in Pumpkinhead (1988), a grouchy handyman in Cheerleader Camp (1988), a gregarious railroad worker in The Alpha Incident (1978), a homeless man on a park bench in Back to the Future (1985) (Flower reprised this part in the first sequel), an ill-kept hick in A Small Town in Texas (1976), a peppery camp caretaker in Berserker (1987) and a hillbilly hunter in Skeeter (1993). Flower had guest spots on the TV shows The Dukes of Hazzard (1979), Flo (1980), NYPD Blue (1993), ER (1994), and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993). In addition to his substantial acting credits, Flower also was the casting director for The Witch Who Came from the Sea (1976) and Tiger Man (1983), served as a producer on such features as Hell's Belles (1995), Takin' It Off Out West (1995), The Night Stalker (1986), and Up Yours (1979), handled second unit director chores on The Lonely Lady (1983), Bare Knuckles (1977), and Teenage Innocence (1973), and even co-wrote the scripts for such movies as Wooly Boys (2001), Party Plane (1991), Death Falls (1991), In Search of a Golden Sky (1984), Joyride to Nowhere (1977), Drive In Massacre (1976), and Teenage Seductress (1975). He's the father of actress/costume designer Verkina Flower. George \"Buck\" Flower died of cancer at age 66 on June 18, 2004. Although the \"Buck\" may have sadly stopped, George \"Buck\" Flower's extraordinary cinematic legacy shall continue to live on and entertain film fans all over the world for all eternity.
