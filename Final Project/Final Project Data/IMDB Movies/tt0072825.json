Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"Pierre Vidal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jane Birkin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000945","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MDM3NjczOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ0MDgwNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 December 1946","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Jane Mallory Birkin","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Jane Birkin was born on December 14, 1946 in London, England as Jane Mallory Birkin.

Tristan Bernard, the famous French playwright and producer took notice of this feat. He engaged Dauphin for the leading role of his next play \"La fortune\" was was also made into a film the next year. Dauphin's next break came when Charles Boyer left for American movies. As Boyer left for America, Dauphin succeeded in the Henri Bernstein organization, outstanding stage producers of Paris. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Dauphin starred in several plays as well as sixty five French made pictures. Dauphin received his elementary education at Ecole Fenelon and high school at Lycee Condorcet. he also graduated from Lycee Louis de Grand in literature and philosophy, all of these school located in Paris. Between 1940 and 1945, he was a solider in the French and allied armies. he was a lieutenant in the French tank service and shuttered later in life at his memories of that kind of grisly warfare. After the fall of France, he organized his own stock company and toured non-occupied cities and small towns. he was also serving in the French underground movement. Threatened with exposure, he escaped by buying a small fishing boat in the south of France and sailing to Gibraltar. After reaching London in 1942, he first served with the British Secret Service and then joined the Free French forces of DeGaulle. Claude quickly learned English, of which he was devoid of, and became a liaison officer between the French LeClerc division and the press corps of the American Army of General Patton. Because of this association, he was one of the first to enter Paris on Liberation Day. Dauphin's American film debut was in the movie \"Deported\" produced largely in Italy. He later appeared in many stage productions on Broadway including \"No Exit\" and \"Happy Time\". He later had a screen test with Warner Bros. and then returned to France. Having almost forgotten about the test, he was summoned to Hollywood for \"April in Paris\" starring Doris Day and Ray Bolger.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Njg1NjY2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcxNjczNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202405","name":"Claude Dauphin","idIMDB":"nm0202405"},"actorId":"nm0202405","character":"De Rovère","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Cambo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0131349","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 July 1908","placeOfBirth":" Bort-les-Orgues, Corrèze, France","bio":"Paul Cambo was born on July 3, 1908 in Bort-les-Orgues, Corrèze, France.
