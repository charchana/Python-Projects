Alvarado built his own brand of villain in seriocomic manner that was many times imitated. He appeared in other films like Totoy Gwapo (1970); James Bondat (1970), a send-up on the James Bond films; Deadly Fighter (1970); Liezl at ang Seven Hoods (1971); Mahiwagang Kris (1976); Sebastian Gustavo (1971); Jailbreak (1972); El Vibora (1972) and Nardong Putik (1972). Alvarado won the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts & Sciences (FAMAS) best supporting award for Ang Kampana Sa Santa Quiteria (1971). The same year, he received a trophy for best supporting performance at the 2nd Quezon City Film Festival, for Alyas Bagsik (1971). He was nominated by the FAMAS as best supporting actor for Pitong Makasalanan (1962) and Tiger Unit (1963). With his death, it was never the same again for villainy in Filipino cinema.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0023173","name":"Max Alvarado","nicknames":["Maximo Pompling"],"idIMDB":"nm0023173"},"actorId":"nm0023173","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2226639","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226639","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":null,"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.8","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"29","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0006858","name":"Sunrise"},{"idCompany":"co0319873","name":"Toei Agency"},{"idCompany":"co0151417","name":"Sining Silangan Production"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 18:15:38"}}
