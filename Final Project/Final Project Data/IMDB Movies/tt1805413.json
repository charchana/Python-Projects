With the help of the producer Arthur Freed and the actor Gene Kelly he got the chance to direct the musicals On the Town (1949), Singin' in the Rain (1952), and Love Is Better Than Ever (1952) which revolutionized the genre. Another important work of his own was the musical version of the book of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry 's The Little Prince (1974). As producer, he turned to the genre of comedy, with Surprise Package (1960), but he also produced some films of other genres.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ0MDgxNzEtYWUyZC00MjhkLThmOTItOTU5ZmZjYTg4Zjc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUxODE0MDY@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002045","name":"Stanley Donen","nicknames":["The King of Musicals"],"idIMDB":"nm0002045"},"actorId":"nm0002045","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1805413","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1805413","business":{"budget":{"money":"€100,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["55 min (France)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"filmingLocations":[{"location":"New York City, New York, USA"}],"awards":[],"type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0192504","name":"Wichita Films"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["f rated"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:29:47"}}
