After his parents split up, he had a somewhat unsettled upbringing, spent, alternately, with his mother in St. Petersburg, with his grandparents in Riga and with his father in Hannover. Forced to change school some fifteen times, he eventually completed his education -- though failing to matriculate -- and commenced musical studies at the Leipzig Conservatory under the distinguished concert pianist and educator Professor Robert Teichmüller. He then had a stint as a piano salesman, but soon put his talents to better use 'tickling the ivories' and performing as a cabaret artist and stand-up comic in cafés and on radio in Danzig. He made his proper stage debut at the Riga Schauspielhaus in 1932 in a play, for which he had also composed the music. Then followed several years of financial hardship supporting his new family, a wife and four children. However, in 1938 he was invited by the actor and emcee Willi Schaeffers to join the popular satirical revue Kabarett der Komiker in Berlin. Erhardt quickly established a singular reputation as humorist, as well as persisting with his musical vocation. Though a non-swimmer, he was conscripted to serve as a pianist with the orchestra of the German Navy during the Second World War. After the war, he resumed work on the stage in Hamburg and had a huge national hit as presenter of a weekly radio series (\"So was Dummes\") which spotlighted his forte for spontaneous wit, pun poetry and double entendre. Eventually, the screen beckoned, initially finding him cast in minor supporting parts or as a singing pianist. As his radio fame grew, the bespectacled, cherubic, corpulent Erhardt became an instant cinematic favorite. His starring debut in Tired Theodore (1957) was a box-office blockbuster, followed with a back-to-back hit in Widower with 5 Daughters (1957). A kind of querulous equivalent to Hollywood's S.Z. Sakall, Erhardt often lampooned bourgeois values and philistine preoccupations. Thus, even his more irritating characters, like Paul Perlacher in Der Haus-Tyrann (1959), were never dislikeable. In order to escape his typecasting as a comedian, Erhardt founded his own television production company in 1961, though the venture lasted a mere two years.The public seemed more than reluctant to accept Erhardt in any genre other than comedy. Following this disappointment, he returned to the small screen, inevitably in his familiar comic guises, including a recurring role as good-hearted but hapless taxation officer Willi Winzig. He also proceeded to publish several best-selling compilations of his comic poetry and profited from numerous record sales of his live performances. Sadly, in December 1971, Erhardt suffered a paralysing stroke and lost the facility of speech, which effectively put an end to his career. He died eight years later in Hamburg at the age of seventy, six months after receiving Germany's highest award, the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258918","name":"Heinz Erhardt","idIMDB":"nm0258918"},"actorId":"nm0258918","character":"Fritz Eilers","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hans-Joachim Kulenkampff","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0474478","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 April 1921","placeOfBirth":" Bremen, Germany","bio":"Hans-Joachim Kulenkampff was born on April 27, 1921 in Bremen, Germany.

That he became an actor comes as no surprise considering that his mother, Rosa Albach-Retty, was a star of the Viennese stage. Of course, Magda Schneider, the woman he married in 1936, was an actress. And logically indeed they begot another famous actress by the name of ... Romy Schneider. Unfortunately, being Romy's father is probably Wolf Albach-Retty's greatest claim for glory, for despite his acting talents he privileged - lock, stock and barrel - commercial cinema, opting for romance films, superficial musicals and mediocre comedies which pleased the crowds but did not make film history. Too bad because his acting talents would have been welcome in the world of Max Ophüls, Wolfgang Liebeneiner or Helmut Käutner, among others. His theater career was much more satisfactory, notably his acclaimed performances in plays by Athur Schnitler.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDIzM2U5NjMtY2FhYi00OTRiLTk3MjUtYTkwMzNiNzIxY2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0016208","name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","idIMDB":"nm0016208"},"actorId":"nm0016208","character":"Prof. Johannes Büttner","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Waltraut Haas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352020","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 June 1927","placeOfBirth":" Vienna, Austria","birthName":"Waltraute Haas","bio":"Waltraut Haas was born on June 9, 1927 in Vienna, Austria as Waltraute Haas.

During the war years, she was touted in Nazi propaganda as an ideal of Germanic femininity. Her association with members of the regime, including the ever roving-eyed Joseph Goebbels, damaged her career in the aftermath of World War II. Nonetheless, she would reemerge in the 1950's as a more versatile actress, if not a bigger star. Mady Rahl was strong-willed and had a commanding, almost aristocratic air about her. Most of all, she possessed that quality called pizzazz. From her early teens, Mady was determined to seek a career in the performing arts. In the process, she financed her expensive acting (at the Ilka Grüning School) and dance classes by doing secretarial work (being an adept typist and stenographer). Rumour has it, that she got her start on the stage (in Leipzig) without having to sit for an audition. Her looks and comportment seemed entirely sufficient. Film work came in due course, after she met a young director named Detlef Sierck (who later found fame and fortune in Hollywood as Douglas Sirk). He starred her in his first film (a short comedy) as, perhaps unsurprisingly, a secretary. Having signed a four-year contract with Ufa, she found herself in yet another clerical role for The Mysterious Mister X (1936). Her first critical acclaim arrived courtesy of a role in the lavish circus drama Le saut de la mort (1937), in which she co-starred alongside the dancer La Jana. Then followed a succession of small roles in big Ufa productions like To New Shores (1937) and Allo Janine (1939) and leads in lightweight romantic comedies (notably Mademoiselle (1939) and Die lustigen Vagabunden (1940), opposite Johannes Heesters). By the mid-1940's, Mady had become one of the most celebrated stars of German films. After a post-war hiatus, her screen career was reinvigorated with a handful of dramatic character roles as mysterious or genteel women in prestige pictures like The Lady in Black (1951), UB 55, corsaire de l'océan (1957) and L'étau (1958). In the early 1960's, Mady returned to the theatre, going on tour with the Munich-based 'Kleine Komödie'. She also became a popular TV guest star, seemingly omnipresent in prime time cop shows. She was also busily doing voice-overs for diverse American actresses, from Gillian Anderson to Arlene Francis. By the mid-1990's, the thrice-married actress had wound down her performing career to concentrate on her other vocation as a successful painter and exhibitor of water colours. Almost blind and afflicted by dementia, Mady Rahl died in August 2009 at the respectable age of 94.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0706703","name":"Mady Rahl","idIMDB":"nm0706703"},"actorId":"nm0706703","character":"Malchen Eilers","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Katharina Mayberg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0562229","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 March 1925","placeOfBirth":" Hamburg, Germany","bio":"Katharina Mayberg was born on March 31, 1925 in Hamburg, Germany.
