Moved to LA in the late 90s. He has been studying acting and working towards his goals in TV & film ever since. Some highlights are Master & Commander: The Far Side Of The World.(uncredited-but plenty of pics to prove it!) The work lasted 5 months and shot at Fox Studios Baja. He played the role of the Sgt. of the Royal Marines. This included 2 weeks of \"boot camp\" before principal photography began. He had the luxury of watching both Russell Crowe & Paul Bettany work for the entire shoot. Russell once told him he was \"A consummate professional\". He has taken those words to heart ever since. He also had the opportunity early on to play Fingers The Pirate in Spongebob Squarepants: The Movie. His latest role in a film called Cade, has him playing a father that has recently lost his son to suicide and attempts to bring him back to life through A.I. In his spare time, he is an avid trad rock climber and loves elevation backpacking.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0OTI1MjExM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTIwMzMxMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1767103","name":"Gerard Griesbaum","idIMDB":"nm1767103"},"actorId":"nm1767103","character":"Dennis Rader","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0035712","main":true},{"actorName":"Eric Gerleman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0969195","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMzEwODQ1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzk3ODgy._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Eric Gerleman is an actor, known for B.T.K.
