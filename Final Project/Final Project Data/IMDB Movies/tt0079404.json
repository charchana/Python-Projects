An avid fan of fantasy and science fiction, Shin Kishida also wrote a number of scenarios for that genre. Cast by veteran director Ishiro Honda, he also co-starred as the handicapped mechanic in Kaetekita Urutoraman (1971). Other highly visible roles outside Japan included that of one of the three evil brothers in Shogun Assassin (1981) and that of the mysterious Interpol agent in Gojira tai Mekagojira (1974).
