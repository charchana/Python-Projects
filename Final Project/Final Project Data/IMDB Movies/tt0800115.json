She had previously appeared with Patrick Swayze in John Milius's cold war drama Red Dawn (1984) as 'Toni', one of the 'Wolverines', a group of renegade teenagers fighting for their country during World War III. She then starred in Francis Ford Coppola's The Cotton Club (1984) and the John Badham project American Flyers (1985). By this time she had been linked in with the 'so-called' Brat Pack and unsurprisingly won a starring role in John Hughes's hit comedy Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) playing the older sister of Matthew Broderick and love interest of Charlie Sheen. As the 1980s drew to a close, Jennifer headlined Howard Brookner's romantic drama Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989), which again teamed her with Alan Ruck, and also Matt Dillon and Madonna. Since then she has worked steadily, starring in over 34 Film and TV appearances including Le soulier magique (1990), Wind (1992), and Bounce (2000). Jennifer will nevertheless be best remembered as 'Baby' in Dirty Dancing (1987), a role that earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTExMTcxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYwMDc4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000426","name":"Jennifer Grey","idIMDB":"nm0000426"},"actorId":"nm0000426","character":"Claire Jamison","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Megan Park","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1177914","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgwNDE5NzU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTcyNTQ0MDI@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 July 1986","placeOfBirth":" Lindsay, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Megan Marie Park","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Megan Park was born on July 24, 1986 in Lindsay, Ontario, Canada as Megan Marie Park.
