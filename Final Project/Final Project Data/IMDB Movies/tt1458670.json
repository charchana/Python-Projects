Family escaped Berlin in 1933 and settled in Palestine where he grew up. In 1947 family migrated to the US, shortened their name to Jacobs and became naturalized citizens. Wolf, who became William Jacobs, was drafted in 1951 before becoming a citizen, and sent to the Korean front for all of 1952. Upon his discharge, he studied Drama at the Neighborhood Playhouse '53-'55 on the G.I.Bill. After graduation he was much involved in off-Broadway Theater and subsequently signed by theatrical agents, who had him change his professional name to William Sargent - which he later legalized. In 1960 he came to Hollywood for a minor film roll and stayed for the next 27 years working in T.V. and Theater. In 1987 he and his wife moved to Salt Lake City, where two years later, he opened a downtown Theater which ran for 4 seasons. He lives in Utah with his wife Patricia and their two cats - and now primarily does voice-overs.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0765095","name":"William Sargent","idIMDB":"nm0765095"},"actorId":"nm0765095","character":"Endor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Duane Hill","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0384209","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Duane Hill is an actor and writer, known for The Executioner's Song (1982), The Bobroom (2004) and Side by Side: The True Story of the Osmond Family (1982).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0384209","name":"Duane Hill","idIMDB":"nm0384209"},"actorId":"nm0384209","character":"Strong Man","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1458670","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1458670","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["30 min"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"type":"TV Episode","seasonInfo":{"tvSerie":{"name":"The Animated Book of Mormon","id":"tt5154104"},"season":"Season 1","episode":"Episode 2"},"companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0136551","name":"Living Scriptures"},{"idCompany":"co0070555","name":"Rich Animation Studios"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["lds film","mormon","mormonism","independent film"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 07:59:40"}}
