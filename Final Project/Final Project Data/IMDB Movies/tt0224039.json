The scene opens in a large boudoir of an apparently wealthy man's home. His children, assisted by their governess, are about to retire. Before lying down they hang up their stockings on the edge of the bed. The picture changes and night appears. We see the housetops of the town and angels are flying about depositing packages in each of the chimneys. Santa Claus is also busy and furnishes our little friends with numerous presents. Again a change in the picture and we see the corridor of the old village church. The sexton, an old grey haired man, stands by, while a number of lusty boys pull the rope attached to the great bell in the belfry. The bell tolling in the steeple bursts into view, after which the interior of the church is seen with the full choir accompanied by the organist and choir boys singing the Christmas hymn.

Méliès was an especially prolific innovator in the use of special effects, popularizing such techniques as substitution splices, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted color. His films include A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Impossible Voyage (1904), both involving strange, surreal journeys somewhat in the style of Jules Verne, and are considered among the most important early science fiction films. Méliès died of cancer on 21 January 1938 at the age of 76. In 2016, a Méliès film long thought lost, A Wager Between Two Magicians, was discovered in a Czechoslovak film archive.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNzM5MzEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3NzMyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0617588","name":"Georges Méliès","idIMDB":"nm0617588"},"actorId":"nm0617588","character":"Beggar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0425740","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0224039","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0224039","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["4 min"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["160 m"],"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"5.9","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"207","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0015284","name":"Star-Film"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["christmas","angel","trick photography"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 02:48:12"}}
