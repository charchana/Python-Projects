Marisa, who has been ordered to do volunteer work as a punishment for assaulting her teacher, falls for a young man who has been accused of knocking over a gas station, and does some investigating to try and clear his name. Sandy, on the other hand, has taken the job in order to be with her doctor boyfriend, but also takes up with a few of her handsomer patients as well before transferring to a sex clinic. Dianne, meanwhile, falls for a basketball player, whom she tries to talk into giving up drugs for good.","simplePlot":"Young, pretty nurses and their hospital adventures.","actors":[{"actorName":"Candice Rialson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722681","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NTM4MTQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDExODYyNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 December 1951","placeOfBirth":" Santa Monica, California, USA","birthName":"Candice Ann Rialson","bio":"Lovely, radiant, enticing and charismatic blonde Candice Rialson was perhaps the most dynamic and personable actress to appear in enjoyably trashy drive-in pictures throughout the 70s. After making her film debut in an uncredited bit as a bikini-clad beauty on the beach in The Gay Deceivers (1969), the pert 'n' perky Candice enlivened a bunch of choice down 'n' dirty exploitation features: she was a naive, innocent hitchhiker who runs afoul of kinky perverts in the bizarre Pets (1973), one of Gloria Grahame's slutty daughters in the sleazy Mama's Dirty Girls (1974), a hapless lass with a talking and singing vagina (!) in the outrageously bawdy Chatterbox! (1977), a small-town tramp in the immensely entertaining Moonshine County Express (1977), and a stuck-up starlet in the nifty Stunts (1977). Following her winningly easy 'n' breezy turns in the amiably silly soft-core comedies Candy Stripe Nurses (1974) and Summer School Teachers (1974) for legendary B-movie filmmaker Roger Corman, Candice expertly essayed her best, most substantial and appealing role as \"Candy Wednesday\", a bubbly aspiring actress who winds up working for the chintzy schlock movie studio \"Miracle Pictures\" (\"If it's a good film, then it's a Miracle\") in the very clever and hilarious junk film parody Hollywood Boulevard (1976). Moreover, Rialson also had bit parts in the mainstream features The Eiger Sanction (1975), Logan's Run (1976) and Silent Movie (1976) and made guest appearances on the TV shows Maude (1972), Shaft (1973), Switch (1975), Adam's Rib (1973) and Fantasy Island (1977). After doing yet another minor part as a nurse playing with a rake in Winter Kills (1979), Candice Rialson voluntarily quit acting at the end of the 70s. However, she remained a cult favorite of 70s exploitation film fans. Quentin Tarantino, in particular, was such a strong admirer of Rialson's work that he reportedly patterned the Bridget Fonda character in Jackie Brown (1997) after her. Candice Rialson passed away at age 54 from liver disease on March 31st, 2006. She is much loved and missed by her many fans the world over.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NTM4MTQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDExODYyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722681","name":"Candice Rialson","idIMDB":"nm0722681"},"actorId":"nm0722681","character":"Sandy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robin Mattson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0560478","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4OTQ2OTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM1MjY2MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 June 1956","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Robin Mattson was born on June 1, 1956 in Los Angeles, California, USA.

At the age of three his father took the family to South Africa where his work moved them around until Kendrew's teenage years, which he spent in Durban. Kendrew moved from being class clown to a theatrical career in 1953 when he stepped in at Principal Dancer level for an Italian touring opera when their Principal broke his ankle. Kendrew considers that his first break. His second break came about eleven years later when an actress booked into the Intimate theatre broke her ankle and Kendrew was asked by Leon Gluckman to write a fill-in piece to save the theatre from going dark. That piece was Wait a Minim - which was an international success and toured the world for seven years, including two at the Fortune Theatre in London and almost two years at the John Golden Theatre on Broadway. Gluckman produced and directed the anti-apartheid revue with the entire cast contributing to the production's development. At the end of the Minim tour Kendrew settled in California, continuing some performance but mainly focusing on writing. His notoriety and popularity from Minim held him in good stead and he was often a guest on the talk shows of the time. The Smothers' Brothers so liked Minim they offered him a job as staff writer for their Summer Season and he stayed with them for a few years before moving to write for the Dean Martin Show and then Martin's Gold Diggers. Because of Kendrew's comic timing and performance background he was often used as the \"other man\" in their broadcast comedy sketches. One famous example with Peter Sellers, Julius \"Nipsy\" Russell and Dean Martin included Kendrew: The Midnight Cat Burglar. Kendrew was a successful playwright and poet by now but still was called on by friends to make cameo appearances and to play some of his own characters onstage. As of mid 2015 Kendrew lives just outside Los Angeles, California, and is still writing with a tally of around four musicals, six stage plays, eight screenplays, five novels and various poems and lyrics, including some recorded by John Denver, Jack Lemmon, Peter Lawford and the band Chicago.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0489472","name":"Kendrew Lascelles","idIMDB":"nm0489472"},"actorId":"nm0489472","character":"Owen Boles","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Ross Verona","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894775","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 October 1933","placeOfBirth":" USA","bio":"Michael Ross Verona was born on October 12, 1933 in the USA.
