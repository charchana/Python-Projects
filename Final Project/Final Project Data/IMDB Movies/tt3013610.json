On a professional level first, the middle-aged film director, has started wondering whether the committed movies she has been making are really an actual reflection of the world she lives in ; on top of this, she is in conflict not only with her crew but also, and primarily, with Barry Huggins, a well-known American actor of Italian origin, who proves awfully bad and uncontrollable. On the personal level, things do not get any better - it could even be said they are worse. Margherita has just left her life partner and she has become unable to relate to her teenage daughter. As for her mother, she is now seriously ill and her doctor tries to prepare her brother and her for the worst. Which is unacceptable to the weakened woman who can find salvation only in denial of reality. Will she manage to face up to the facts and to come to terms with herself?","simplePlot":"Margherita, a director in the middle of an existential crisis, has to deal with the inevitable and still unacceptable loss of her mother.","actors":[{"actorName":"Margherita Buy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0125540","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NzAyMTQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2OTUyNQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 January 1962","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","bio":"Margherita Buy was born on January 15, 1962 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.

Turturro was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Italian-American parents, Katherine, a jazz singer, and Nicholas Turturro, a construction worker and carpenter. His brother, also named Nicholas Turturro, is an actor, and actress Aida Turturro is his cousin. Turturro has become a regular in the thought provoking films of Spike Lee and the off the wall comedies of Joel Coen & Ethan Coen. His wonderful performances include as the highly agitated \"Pino\" in Do the Right Thing (1989), as an intellectual playwright in Barton Fink (1991), a pedophile tenpin bowler in The Big Lebowski (1998), a confused boyfriend in Jungle Fever (1991) and as the voice of Harvey the dog in Summer of Sam (1999). Turturro has continued to appeal to audiences despite his unconventional looks and the often annoying onscreen mannerisms of his characters which he used to great effect in films such as his blue collar tale of warring brothers in the construction business, Mac (1992), as the irate, dumped game show contestant, Herbie Stempel, in Robert Redford's dynamic Quiz Show (1994). One of modern American cinema's gems of acting, Turturro remains in strong demand for his high calibre thespian talents.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYwNjgwMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjUwOTc3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001806","name":"John Turturro","idIMDB":"nm0001806"},"actorId":"nm0001806","character":"Barry Huggins","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0510100","main":true},{"actorName":"Giulia Lazzarini","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493980","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 March 1934","placeOfBirth":" Milan, Lombardy, Italy","bio":"Giulia Lazzarini was born on March 24, 1934 in Milan, Lombardy, Italy.

In 1970 he also played in water-polo first division in Italy, and in the junior National team. In those years he was also very committed in politcs, within the extra-parliament left wing. Once finished high school studies, he sold his stamps collection to buy a super8 cinema camera, using which he started shooting home-made short films with his friends in 1973. His professional movie-making career starts with Ecce bombo (1978). This was also his first nation-wide success, and still a cult-movie for many Italians.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MTQyMTcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg2MzIzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604335","name":"Nanni Moretti","idIMDB":"nm0604335"},"actorId":"nm0604335","character":"Giovanni","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0510102","main":true},{"actorName":"Beatrice Mancini","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6281453","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Beatrice Mancini is an actress, known for Mia Madre (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6281453","name":"Beatrice Mancini","idIMDB":"nm6281453"},"actorId":"nm6281453","character":"Livia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Stefano Abbati","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007845","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 February 1955","placeOfBirth":" Rimini, Italy","bio":"Stefano Abbati was born on February 23, 1955 in Rimini, Italy.
