However, he spent most of the next decade in television, regularly appearing in Combat! (1962), The Virginian (1962), Gunsmoke (1955) and 12 O'Clock High (1964). Skerritt's next big break was appearing alongside Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould in Robert Altman's biting satire MASH (1970). Several other film roles quickly followed, before he landed the plum role of Capt. Dallas of the ill-fated commercial towing vehicle Nostromo in the creepy sci-fi epic Alien (1979). Skerritt turned up again in another thriller playing a cop hunting a serial killer in the eerie The Dead Zone (1983), as a Navy Officer Flight instructor in Top Gun (1986) , in the six-chick flick Steel Magnolias (1989), and then as the poster boy for a \"Guess\" Jeans ad campaign utilizing his mature, weather-beaten features. Skerritt didn't neglect his TV background and reappeared on the small screen in Cheers (1982), The China Lake Murders (1990) and picked up an Emmy in 1994 for his performance as Sheriff Brock in the superb series Picket Fences (1992). Skerritt has remained continually busy for the past decade, contributing natural, entertaining and reliable performances in TV series, made-for-TV movies and major theatrical releases. He recreated the role of Will Kane in the TV production of High Noon (2000), and appeared alongside Bruce Willis in the mercenary war drama Tears of the Sun (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY3Mjk5MTMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjUxMTc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000643","name":"Tom Skerritt","idIMDB":"nm0000643"},"actorId":"nm0000643","character":"Horse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0135023","main":true},{"actorName":"Ellen Burstyn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000995","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MjYxMDc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU3MDIz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 December 1932","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Edna Rae Gillooly","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Ellen Burstyn was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Correine Marie (Hamel) and John Austin Gillooly. She is of mostly Irish, German, and French-Canadian descent. Ellen worked a number of jobs before she became an actress. At 14, she was a short-order cook at a lunch counter. After graduating from Detroit's Cass Technical High School, she went to Texas to model and then to New York as a showgirl on The Jackie Gleason Show (1952). From there, it was to Montreal as a nightclub dancer and then Broadway with her debut in \"Fair Game (1957)\". By 1963, she appeared on the TV series The Doctors (1963), but she gained notice for her role in Goodbye Charlie (1964). Ellen then took time off to study acting with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Her big break came when she was cast as the female lead in The Last Picture Show (1971). For this role, she received nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award. Next, she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in The King of Marvin Gardens (1972), giving a chilling performance. Then came The Exorcist (1973). Ellen was again nominated for the Golden Globe and Academy Award. In 1974, she starred in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), playing a waitress, which is a job that she well knows. For this performance, she won the Oscar as Best Actress as well as the British award for the same category. For the Golden Globe, she was nominated but lost to Marsha Mason. The same year, Ellen made history by winning a Tony Award for the Broadway play \"Same Time, Next Year\". She won praise and award nominations for the movie version of Same Time, Next Year (1978) and Resurrection (1980). \"Resurrection\" was a another great film in which she played a woman with the power to heal. Even with all these successful movies and all the awards, Ellen found that she could barely get a job in the 80s. A succession of TV movies resulting in two Emmy nominations kept Ellen going as did the series The Ellen Burstyn Show (1986). The TV movies continued through the 90s. Also in the 90s, Ellen was cast in the supporting role in such movies as The Cemetery Club (1993), How to Make an American Quilt (1995), The Baby-Sitters Club (1995) and The Spitfire Grill (1996). In addition to her acting, Burstyn was the first woman president of Actor's Equity, the actors' union, from 1982 to 1985.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MjYxMDc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU3MDIz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000995","name":"Ellen Burstyn","idIMDB":"nm0000995"},"actorId":"nm0000995","character":"Swan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Harbour","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0361959","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 March 1990","placeOfBirth":" Montreal, Québec, Canada","bio":"Matthew Harbour was born on March 19, 1990 in Montreal, Québec, Canada.

It was at that age that he was awarded the coveted role of voicing the character \"The Brain\" in the hit children's TV series, Arthur (1996). The role immediately launched him into the realm of \"Babe Magnet\". With this in mind, he continued down the path of acting (in both voice, TV and film) until he came to the realization that he was no longer the cute infant that Public Broadcasting had learned to love. Now that his baby-fat cheeks had left him, he knew that he needed a new \"hook \"to catch the ladies. Frantically, he searched for the answer until one summer, working as manual labor for the \"Just for Laughs\" Comedy Festival, the art of stand-up comedy caught his eye. He approached a famous comedian and received advice on how to get started in the business, after which he was escorted from the premises, fined a hefty sum and brutally beaten. Once the feeding tube was removed, Steven sauntered on down to a local comedy club to try his hand at the trade. The throwing of vegetables and angry screams of the crowd created an incredible \"rush\", upon which Steven became immediately addicted and he never looked back. One year later, at 18 years old, Steven returned to the \"Just for Laughs\" as the youngest Comedian ever to grace the festivals stage (breaking the previous record set by Chris Rock at 19). His act was so well received that coordinators decided to feature him on XM Radio and booked him on tours across North America. Now, based out New York City, and fresh off of winning the nationwide \"So you Think You're Funny\" MySpace Comedy Contest, Steven Crowder continues to please both audiences and critics with his unique brand of comedy and point of view.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEzNDYyNTYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE0MDIzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0189589","name":"Steven Crowder","nicknames":["Louder With Crowder"],"idIMDB":"nm0189589"},"actorId":"nm0189589","character":"Baseball Boy #1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Harbour","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0997026","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Harbour is an actor, known for Mona le vampire (1999), The Velveteen Rabbit (2009) and The Stork Derby (2002).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0997026","name":"James Harbour","idIMDB":"nm0997026"},"actorId":"nm0997026","character":"Baseball Boy #2","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0974662","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974662","business":{"budget":{"money":"$5,500,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$92,536","country":"USA","day":"30","month":"01","year":"2009","remarks":""}],"gross":[{"money":"$143,715","country":"USA","day":"16","month":"03","year":"2009","remarks":""}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 37 min (97 min)"],"soundMix":["DTS"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.4","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Montréal, Québec, Canada"}],"rated":"G","awards":[{"award":"KIDS FIRST!
