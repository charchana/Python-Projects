He was born in Tsingtao, China, to Japanese parents and grew up in Dalian. He did not set foot in Japan until he was 21. His father was an importer and a commercial photographer, and young Toshiro worked in his father's studio for a time after graduating from Dalian Middle School. He was automatically drafted into the Japanese army when he turned 20, and enlisted in the Air Force where he was attached to the Aerial Photography Unit for the duration of the World War II. In 1947 he took a test for Kajirô Yamamoto, who recommended him to director Senkichi Taniguchi, thus leading to Mifune's first film role in These Foolish Times II (1947). Mifune then met and bonded with director Akira Kurosawa, and the two joined to become the most prominent actor-director pairing in all Japanese cinema. Beginning with Drunken Angel (1948), Mifune appeared in 16 of Kurosawa's films, most of which have become world-renowned classics. In Kurosawa's pictures, especially Rashomon (1950), Mifune would become the most famous Japanese actor in the world. A dynamic and ferocious actor, he excelled in action roles, but also had the depth to plumb intricate and subtle dramatic parts. A personal rift during the filming of Red Beard (1965) ended the Mifune-Kurosawa collaboration, but Mifune continued to perform leading roles in major films both in Japan and in foreign countries. He was twice named Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (for Yojimbo (1961) and Red Beard (1965)). In 1963 he formed his own production company, directing one film and producing several others. In his later years he gained new fame in the title role of the American TV miniseries Shogun (1980), and appeared infrequently in cameo roles after that. His last years were plagued with Alzheimer's Syndrome and he died of organ failure in 1997, a few months before the death of the director with whose name he will forever be linked, Akira Kurosawa.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NzE2MzEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5MTU4Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536","name":"Toshirô Mifune","nicknames":["The Wolf","The Shogun"],"idIMDB":"nm0001536"},"actorId":"nm0001536","character":"Sanjuro Kuwabatake / The Samurai","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002066","main":true},{"actorName":"Tatsuya Nakadai","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619938","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzYwNDA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDExMTMwNw@@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1932","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","birthName":"Motohisa Nakadai","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Japanese leading man, an important star and one of the handful of Japanese actors well known outside Japan.

Like Mifune, Nakadai worked frequently with director Akira Kurosawa and indeed more or less replaced Mifune as Kurosawa's principal leading man after the well-known falling out between Mifune and Kurosawa. His appearances for Kurosawa in Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980) and Ran (1985) are among the most indelible in the director's oeuvre.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzYwNDA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDExMTMwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619938","name":"Tatsuya Nakadai","nicknames":["Moya","The Snake"],"idIMDB":"nm0619938"},"actorId":"nm0619938","character":"Unosuke - Gunfighter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yôko Tsukasa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875362","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzg4NDQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk5MDUwNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 August 1934","placeOfBirth":" Sakaiminato, Japan","birthName":"Yoko Shoji","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Yôko Tsukasa was born on August 20, 1934 in Sakaiminato, Japan as Yoko Shoji.

A native of southern Japan, Shimura was a descendant of the samurai warrior class. Following university training, he founded a theatre company, Shichigatsu-za (\"July Theatre\"). In 1930 he joined a professional company, Kindai-za (\"Modern Theatre\"). Four years later he signed with the Kinema Shinko film studio. He found a niche playing samurai roles for various studios, then signed a long-term contract with Toho Studios in 1943. He appeared in an average of six films a year for Toho over the next four decades. His greatest critical acclaim came in more than 20 roles for Kurosawa, though he is almost as well recognized outside Japan for his kindly doctor role in the original \"Godzilla\" (Godzilla (1954)). Shimura's triumph was his unforgettable performance as a dying bureaucrat in Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952). He continued to act steadily, in good films and bad, almost until his death, culminating with Kurosawa's Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980). He is often described as filling the spot for Kurosawa that Ward Bond filled for John Ford--an ever-present and reliable character player who consistently supplied a solidity and strength to whatever film he appeared in. Shimura was, to be sure, even a finer actor than Bond, and his range was enormous, from \"Ikiru\"'s diffident clerk to the leader of the Seven Samurai in Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954). He died in 1982, a reluctant icon of Japanese cinema.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyNjY0ODYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg0MTc4Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793766","name":"Takashi Shimura","idIMDB":"nm0793766"},"actorId":"nm0793766","character":"Tokuemon - Sake Brewer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hiroshi Tachikawa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0846187","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 March 1931","placeOfBirth":" Japan","bio":"Hiroshi Tachikawa was born on March 7, 1931 in Japan.
