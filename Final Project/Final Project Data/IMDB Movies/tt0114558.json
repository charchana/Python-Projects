He is the eldest of six children. Four of his siblings are also in the arts: Martha Fiennes, a director; Magnus Fiennes, a musician; Sophie Fiennes, a producer; and Joseph Fiennes, an actor. He is of English, Irish, and Scottish origin. A noted Shakespeare interpreter, he first achieved success onstage at the Royal National Theatre. Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (1992), opposite Juliette Binoche. 1993 was his \"breakout year\". He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film The Baby of Mâcon (1993), with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993). For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role, as well as Best Supporting Actor honors from numerous critics groups, including the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York, Chicago, Boston, and London Film Critics associations. His portrayal as Göth also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute's list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994). In 1996, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Count Almásy the World War II epic romance, and another Best Picture winner, Anthony Minghella's The English Patient (1996), in which he starred with Kristin Scott Thomas. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations, as well as two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award nominations, one for Best Actor and another shared with the film's ensemble cast. Since then, Fiennes has been in a number of notable films, including Strange Days (1995), Oscar and Lucinda (1997), the animated The Prince of Egypt (1998), István Szabó's Sunshine (1999), Neil Jordan-directed films The End of the Affair (1999) and L'homme de la Riviera (2002), Dragon rouge (2002), Maid in Manhattan (2002), The Constant Gardener (2005), In Bruges (2008), The Reader (2008), co-starring Kate Winslet, Kathryn Bigelow's Oscar®-winning The Hurt Locker (2008), Clash of the Titans (2010), Mike Newell's screen adaptation of Charles Dickens'Great Expectations (2012), with Helena Bonham Carter and Jeremy Irvine, and Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). He is also known for his roles in major film franchises such as the Harry Potter film series (2005-2011), in which he played the evil Lord Voldemort. His nephew, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin played Tom Riddle, the young Lord Voldemort, in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009). Ralph also appears in the James Bond series, in which he has played M, starting with the 2012 film Skyfall (2012). In 2011, Fiennes made his directorial debut with his film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy political thriller Coriolanus (2011), in which he also played the title character, opposite Gerard Butler and Vanessa Redgrave. Fiennes has won a Tony Award for playing Prince Hamlet on Broadway. In 2015, Fiennes played a music producer in Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), starring opposite Tilda Swinton and Matthias Schoenaerts, and in 2016, Fiennes starred in Joel and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar!

Angela Evelyn Bassett was born on August 16, 1958 in New York City, to Betty Jane (Gilbert), a social worker, and Daniel Benjamin Bassett, a preacher's son. Bassett and her sister D'nette grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida with their mother. As a single mother, Betty stressed the importance of education for her children.

To date, she has worked with some of the most revered directors in the industry, including Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Lasse Hallström, Oliver Stone and Garry Marshall. Whether lending dramatic authenticity or a natural comedic flair to her roles, Lewis graces the screen with remarkable range and an original and captivating style. Lewis was born in Los Angeles, Californa, to Glenis (Duggan) Batley, a graphic designer, and Geoffrey Lewis, an actor. By the age of six, she knew she wanted to be a performer. At twelve, Lewis landed her first leading role in the Showtime miniseries Home Fires (1987). After appearing in several TV sitcoms including The Wonder Years (1988), she made her move to film, starring with Chevy Chase in National Lampoon's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) and with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the drama Crooked Hearts (1991). At 16, Lewis starred opposite Brad Pitt in the critically acclaimed television movie Too Young to Die? (1990), catching the attention of Martin Scorsese, who cast her in his thriller Cape Fear (1991). Her powerful scenes with Robert De Niro captured the quiet complexities of adolescence and earned her an Oscar nomination and Golden Globe nomination for \"Best Supporting Actress\". Her auditorium scene with De Niro went down in movie history as one of cinema's classic scenes. Lewis next worked with Woody Allen in Husbands and Wives (1992), playing a self-assured college coed with a penchant for older men and, particularly, her married professor. She quickly followed suit with a succession of starring roles in a variety of blockbusters and critically acclaimed projects including Kalifornia (1993), Romeo Is Bleeding (1993), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) and Natural Born Killers (1994), Oliver Stone's controversial media satire about two mass murderers who become legendary folk heroes. Lewis's other credits include the Nora Ephron comedy Mixed Nuts (1994), with Steve Martin and Adam Sandler; the sci-fi action film Strange Days (1995) with Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett; Quentin Tarantino's vampire tale From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) with George Clooney; The Evening Star (1996) with Shirley MacLaine; the Garry Marshall-directed The Other Sister (1999), and Todd Phillips' Old School (2003), co-starring opposite Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as well as Starsky & Hutch (2004). In addition to her film career, Lewis has continued to add roles to her growing list of television credits with a performance in Showtime's My Louisiana Sky (2001), for which she secured an EMMY nomination, and a starring role in the Mira Nair-directed HBO's film Hysterical Blindness (2002), alongside Uma Thurman and Gena Rowlands. After a six-year hiatus from film to pursue her burgeoning music career exclusively, Lewis announced her return to acting with a handful of upcoming movies. Juliette starred alongside Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Kristen Wiig and Jimmy Fallon in the comedy Whip It (2009). The film was released by Fox Searchlight on October 2nd, 2009. Directed by Drew Barrymore, the film tells the story of an ex-beauty pageant contestant that leaves her crowns behind after joining a roller derby team. Lewis plays \"Iron Maven\", the star of a top derby team. Next, she joined the cast of the acclaimed European animated thriller Metropia (2009), as the voice of \"Nina\". She also appeared in the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), opposite Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman and Patrick Wilson. The film tells the story of a single mother (Aniston) who decides to have a child using a sperm donor. Juliette plays \"Debbie Epstein\", the best friend of Aniston's character. Lewis also appears in Sympathy for Delicious (2010), Mark Ruffalo's directorial debut. The film follows a paralyzed DJ, struggling to survive on the streets of LA who turns to faith healing and mysteriously develops the ability to cure the sick. Juliette plays \"Ariel\", costarring alongside Orlando Bloom, Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney. The film took home the US Dramatic Special Jury Prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Most recently, Juliette Lewis appears in the indie-drama Conviction (2010), which stars Hilary Swank, Melissa Leo, Minnie Driver and Sam Rockwell. She plays \"Roseanna Perry\" in the true story of an unemployed single mother (Swank) who saw her brother begin serving a life sentence in 1983 for murder and robbery. The role has won Lewis praise from audiences and critics, alike, for her performance, with USA Today saying, \"Juliette Lewis has an indelible role\" and the San Francisco Chronicle saying \"Her character work should be studied in schools. Just remarkable\". In addition to Conviction (2010), Lewis also makes a cameo in Todd Phillips' comedy, Due Date (2010), starring Robert Downey Jr., Michelle Monaghan and Zach Galifianakis. Beginning in 2004, Juliette took a hiatus from acting to embark on a musical journey. After six years, two full length albums and countless high profile tours and festival gigs with her band, 'Juliette & the Licks', Juliette set out on a solo career. Releasing \"Terra Incognita\" last fall, the album has taken her all across the world from Europe to Japan to Turkey, Australia, North America and Canada.

Thomas Edward Sizemore, Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Judith (Schannault), an ombudsman staff member, and Thomas Edward Sizemore, Sr., a lawyer and professor. Sizemore grew up idolizing the tough-guy characters of the movies he watched. After attending Wayne State University, he got his master's degree in theatre from Temple University in 1986. Like many, he moved to New York City and struggled, waiting tables and performing in plays. His first break came when Oliver Stone cast him in a bit part in Born on the Fourth of July (1989). Bigger roles soon followed throughout the early 1990s, such as Guilty by Suspicion (1991), True Romance (1993), and Striking Distance (1993). 1994 proved to be an even bigger year for Sizemore, as he won the role of \"Bat Masterson\" in Kevin Costner's star-studded biopic Wyatt Earp (1994), as well as one of his first truly memorable roles as \"Detective Jack Scagnetti\" in Oliver Stone's controversial Natural Born Killers (1994). In 1995 he appeared in Devil in a Blue Dress (1995), Strange Days (1995), as well as the acclaimed crime epic Heat (1995), directed by Michael Mann. Sizemore's first big leading role is in The Relic (1997), the big-budget effects thriller directed by Peter Hyams. According to a 2001 interview in The Calgary Sun, Sizemore entered a drug rehabilitation program in 1998 after his mother and his friend Robert De Niro appeared on his door-step during the filming of Witness to the Mob (1998). Telling him they were there to drive him to jail or to rehabilitation, Sizemore chose the latter. After completing rehabilitation, he counseled adolescents involved in substance abuse. Offered roles in W.W.II films directed by both Terrence Malick and Steven Spielberg, Sizemore chose the role of \"Sergeant Horvath\" in Saving Private Ryan (1998). The role and film received wide acclaim and introduced Sizemore's talents to a much broader audience in a more human and well-rounded role than he had previously been given. Sizemore also credits this shoot and Steven Spielberg for helping him with his recovery from addiction, with Steven Spielberg threatening to reshoot the entire film if Sizemore failed a drug test even once. After a flamboyant and uncredited mobster role in Enemy of the State (1998), Sizemore then portrayed a psychotic paramedic in Bringing Out the Dead (1999) directed by Martin Scorsese. Seemingly taking it easy, he then turned in fine but stereotypical performances in Play It to the Bone (1999), Red Planet (2000), and Pearl Harbor (2001). Sizemore then received another leading role in the high-profile military drama Black Hawk Down (2001) directed by yet another legendary director, Ridley Scott. Specializing in the sort of ultimate tough-guy/manly man roles that hearken back to a different era in film, Sizemore continues to be a favourite of Hollywood's greatest directors. Never afraid to speak his mind about anyone and anything, his sense of blunt honesty and lack of pretension is refreshing. A commanding voice and presence on film, Sizemore looks to continue as one of Hollywood's greatest actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNTEzNzExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg4MTY3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001744","name":"Tom Sizemore","nicknames":["Tommy"],"idIMDB":"nm0001744"},"actorId":"nm0001744","character":"Max Peltier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012691","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Wincott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000699","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MTI2NzM3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjEwNzYxMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 January 1958","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Michael Anthony Claudio Wincott","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Over more than thirty years, Michael Wincott has gained the reputation of a respected and uncompromising actor.

He is of Italian descent and has two older sisters. He studied at the Actors Studio and the American Stanislavski Theatre. Vincent D'Onofrio is known as an \"actor's actor\". The wide variety of roles he has played and the quality of his work have earned him a reputation as a versatile talent. His first paid role was in Off-Broadway's \"This Property Is Condemned\". He continued appearing in plays and worked as a bouncer, a bodyguard and a delivery man. In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in \"Open Admissions\", followed by work in numerous other stage plays. In 2012, D'Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theater & Film Institute. As a film actor, D'Onofrio's career break came when he played a mentally unbalanced recruit in Full Metal Jacket (1987), directed by the renowned Stanley Kubrick. For this role D'Onofrio gained nearly 70 pounds. He had a major role in Dying Young (1991), and appeared prominently in the box-office smash Men in Black (1997) as the bad guy (Edgar \"The Bug\"). Other films of note in which he has appeared are Mystic Pizza (1988), JFK (1991), The Player (1992), Ed Wood (1994), The Cell (2000), The Break-Up (2006) and Jurassic World (2015). In 1996, D'Onofrio garnered critical acclaim along with co-star Renée Zellweger for The Whole Wide World (1996), which he helped produce. He also made a guest appearance in Homicide: Life on the Street: The Subway (1997), where he played an accident victim who could not be rescued and was destined to die. For this performance he won an Emmy nomination. In 2000, he both produced and starred in Steal This Movie (2000), a biopic of radical leader Abbie Hoffman. In 2001, D'Onofrio took the role which has likely given him his greatest public recognition: Det. Robert Goren, the lead character in the TV series Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2001). Goren is based on Sherlock Holmes but, instead of relying upon physical evidence like Holmes, D'Onofrio's character focuses on psychology to identify the perpetrators, whom he often draws into confessing or yielding condemning evidence. He played the part for 10 years. In his career D'Onofrio's various film characters have included a priest, a bisexual former porn star, a hijacker, a serial killer, Orson Welles, a space alien, a 1960s radical leader, a pulp fiction writer, an ingenious police investigator and Stuart Smalley's dope-head brother.

Edson currently lives in Los Angeles where, in addition to acting, he is very active in music, writing and photography.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NzYwNjEyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk2NDE1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002057","name":"Richard Edson","idIMDB":"nm0002057"},"actorId":"nm0002057","character":"Tick","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0075852","main":true},{"actorName":"William Fichtner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001209","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyOTI3MzcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIwNzQ3OQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 November 1956","placeOfBirth":" Mitchell Field Air Force Base, East Meadow, Long Island, New York, USA","birthName":"William Edward Fichtner","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"A small-town guy with a big heart, William Fichtner has been captivating the hearts of Western New Yorkers for decades.

He continued to work steadily through the 1980s on shows like Quincy M.E. (1976), Father Murphy (1981), and V (1984) but did not fall into the trap of many child actors who became identified with one famous role because his child roles were as guest spots or, as in the case of Herbie, the Love Bug (1982), were canceled early on, or can't get work as adults and allow their lives to fall to pieces. In a way, Katt has had two careers. The one as the child actor of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and as the character actor of the 1990s who so often played the bully or thug. Extremely talented and at ease in front of a camera in the medium of either television or feature film, Katt has had a very impressive body of work for someone of his age and looks to gain much in the way of future stardom as the series Boston Public (2000) clearly exhibits his leading-man potential.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0NzU0MDczMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzc0Mjkz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0441588","name":"Nicky Katt","idIMDB":"nm0441588"},"actorId":"nm0441588","character":"Joey Corto","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Jace","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0413052","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNzgxNjkzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgwMzExOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 July 1962","placeOfBirth":" Paterson, New Jersey, USA","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Michael Jace was born on July 13, 1962 in Paterson, New Jersey, USA.
