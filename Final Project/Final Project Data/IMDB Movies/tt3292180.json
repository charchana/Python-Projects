Starting his career in 1979 together with John Norum, Tempest achieved a nationwide success in Sweden in 1982 by recording the eponymous first album \"Europe\". The 1984 album Wings Of Tomorrow enabled Europe to tour the whole Scandinavia. Joey Tempest is the author of the world famous anthem of the 80's - The Final Countdown, which reached the top of the Charts in 30 countries of the world. The fame and recognition that he and Europe gained thanks to this song and through other albums (1988 Out Of This World, 1991 Prisoners In Paradise, plus massive touring around the world) endured until 1993 when Europe decided to split. Tempest decided to start his own solo career as a songwriter and singer. His decent and more classic rock oriented albums A Place to Call Home (1995) and Azalea Place (1997) were released only in some European countries and their success was limited only to native Sweden and Norway.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0854649","name":"Joey Tempest","nicknames":["Jocke"],"idIMDB":"nm0854649"},"actorId":"nm0854649","character":"Himself - Lead Vocals","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Norum","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0636328","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 February 1964","placeOfBirth":" Vardö, Norway","birthName":"John Terry Norum","height":"6' 0¾\" (1.85 m)","bio":"John Norum was born on February 23, 1964 in Vardö, Norway as John Terry Norum.
