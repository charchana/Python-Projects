Later, he played in Hamburg and also in Basel, Switzerland, but finally returned to Hamburg. In 1935, his first movie Der Ammenkönig (1935) became a unexpected success and many more such as the legendary Port of Freedom (1944) or the Sissi (1955) trilogy in the 1950s followed. After World War II, his stage career continued in Switzerland, where he lived in Küsnacht and was ensemble member at the Schauspielhaus Zurich.
