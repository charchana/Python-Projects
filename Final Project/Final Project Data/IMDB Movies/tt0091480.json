She lived with her mother, brothers, and sister on a farm not far from Saint-Tropez in Provence (southern France), because her father, singer and poet Guy Béart, did not want his children to be affected by the glamour world of Paris. When Emmanuelle was thirteen, she saw Romy Schneider in the movie Mado (1976). From that time on, she wanted to be an actress. In Emmanuelle's teens, her parents sent her to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for four years, so she could learn English. There, she was engaged for a Robert Altman movie that was never made. After returning to France, she took drama classes and got her first TV role, in Raison perdue (1984). David Hamilton, the photographer/director, was impressed by her beauty and gave her a role in Premiers désirs (1983). She met her spouse-to-be, Daniel Auteuil, while making L'amour en douce (1985). The film that made her famous in France was Manon of the Spring (1986), in which she played the role of a blonde shepherd dancing nude in the fields. Director Tom McLoughlin chose her out of 5,000 candidates for her first Hollywood picture, Date with an Angel (1987). Emmanuelle is a very sensitive and a perfectionist. For the part of Camille in the film Un Coeur en Hiver (1992), she took violin lessons for a whole year. Her biggest success was as a nude model in the art film La belle noiseuse (1991), which starred Michel Piccoli and was directed by Jacques Rivette.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDQ4ODU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjI0ODgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000322","name":"Emmanuelle Béart","idIMDB":"nm0000322"},"actorId":"nm0000322","character":"Manon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0316370","main":true},{"actorName":"Hippolyte Girardot","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320762","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTMwNzE0NTQyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUwNjIwMg@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 October 1955","placeOfBirth":" Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, France","birthName":"Frédéric Girardot","bio":"Hippolyte Girardot was born on October 10, 1955 in Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, France as Frédéric Girardot.
