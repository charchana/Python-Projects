He was the son of Keith (a former luminary of England's late-1960s psychedelic rock scene that yielded Soft Machine and others) and Hazel (a stage designer for Joan Littlewood's theatre company). Arriving in Colchester, Essex in the late '70s, the young Damon began studying music (the piano) and drama. He met Graham Coxon, guitar genius in Stanway Comprehensive School and they formed a group named 'Seymour' later changed to 'Blur', perhaps one of the greatest modern rock groups these days. Damon is the leadsinger of 'Blur' as well as writes songs and plays keybords. His witty, sarcastic lyrics are exquisitely combined with unique sounds, influenced by Beatles, Rolling stones, Kinks and Small Faces. He split with Justine Frischman, frontwoman of 'Elastica' in 1998. _Face (1997)_ is his debut film.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2Mzc5NDg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU3ODM4OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0016332","name":"Damon Albarn","idIMDB":"nm0016332"},"actorId":"nm0016332","character":"Himself - Singer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Graham Coxon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0990461","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 March 1969","placeOfBirth":" Rinteln, Germany","birthName":"Graham Leslie Coxon","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Graham Coxon was born on March 12, 1969 in Rinteln, Germany as Graham Leslie Coxon.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0990461","name":"Graham Coxon","idIMDB":"nm0990461"},"actorId":"nm0990461","character":"Himself - Guitar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alex James","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416262","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 November 1968","placeOfBirth":" Boscombe, Dorset, England, UK","birthName":"Steven Alexander James","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Alex James was born on November 21, 1968 in Boscombe, Dorset, England as Steven Alexander James.
