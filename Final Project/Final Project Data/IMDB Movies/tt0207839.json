Afterward, Shishedo disappears and leaves his co-workers to deal with the ghostly aftermath. In the next segment, Gigi (Christine Ng) wants a memorial service for her departed mother (Lan Law). Seizing the opportunity, Shishedo's co-workers coaxed Gigi into purchasing tons of service materials from them. Upset at the greed, the ghost of Gigi's mother returns to haunt the workers. Lastly, Hung (Fennie Yuen) was dumped by her boyfriend Daviv because the thought of her working at the mortuary doesn't appeal to him.
