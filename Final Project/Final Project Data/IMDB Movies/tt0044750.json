Born in New York City in 1914, he was the son of Sigmond Mohr and Henrietta Noustadt, a Viennese singer. In 1920 his father was killed in a tragic accident while at work when Mohr was five years old, and he was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandfather, who was a psychologist and associate of Dr. Sigmund Freud, the famed psychoanalyst. Mohr became a fervent student of Freud as a result of this association. He was taught to ride and play piano at an early age and attended the prestigious Dwight Preparatory School in New York. Even as a teen, Mohr possessed a smooth vocal delivery and landed a job as a staff broadcaster for CBS Radio, which in turn opened the door for him to Orson Welles and his Mercury Theatre. Mohr made his Broadway debut in the minor role of a gangster in \"The Petrified Forest,\" the same play that put Bogart on the map. His first starring role in films came with the serial Jungle Girl (1941), in which he played principal villain Slick Latimer. However, because of his pleasant, distinctive baritone voice, it was radio that became Mohr's meal ticket during the 1940s, and he signed on for a number of popular suspense thrillers such as \"The Adventures of Philip Marlowe\" and \"The Whistler.\" In 1949, \"Radio and Television Life\" magazine named Mohr as the Best Male Actor on Radio. After a number of bit parts, he finally won a noticeable role in Lady of Burlesque (1943) with Barbara Stanwyck, after Welles referred him to the film's director, William A. Wellman. Following WWII service with the Air Force, Mohr returned to acting and found his niche in intrigue, playing the title role in The Notorious Lone Wolf (1946) and its two sequels, along with Passkey to Danger (1946), Dangerous Business (1946) and The Truth About Murder (1946). As much as he wanted to extricate himself from this trenchcoat stereotype, he continued to chug along in the 1950s with the same type of roles represented by The Sniper (1952), Invasion, U.S.A. (1952) and Guns, Girls, and Gangsters (1958). His final leads were in This Rebel Breed (1960) and the low-grade sci-fi thriller The Angry Red Planet (1959). In 1954-55 he starred as Christopher Storm in 41 episodes of the Swedish-made TV series Foreign Intrigue (1951). Finding film work scarce in the following decade, he found regular work on TV, guest starring in over 100 dramas, ranging from TV westerns like Maverick (1957), Bronco (1958), Cheyenne (1955) and Bonanza (1959) to action/courtroom series such as 77 Sunset Strip (1958), Hawaiian Eye (1959) and Perry Mason (1957), among many others. His last movie role came in the top-notch musical Funny Girl (1968) starring Barbra Streisand and Omar Sharif, in which Mohr was featured as Tom Branca, one of Nicky Arnstein's cronies, who offers to help Fanny Brice out by giving the proud but debt-ridden gambler a prime casino job. Mohr was overseas in Stockholm, Sweden, where he had just completed filming the pilot of a new TV series called \"Private Entrance\" when he suddenly died of a heart attack at the age of 54.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzQ4MDAxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDcxMjUzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596056","name":"Gerald Mohr","idIMDB":"nm0596056"},"actorId":"nm0596056","character":"Vince Potter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peggie Castle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0145312","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMjkxODgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUzODUyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 December 1927","placeOfBirth":" Appalachia, Virginia, USA","birthName":"Peggy Thomas Blair","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Tall, sultry, green-eyed blonde Peggie Castle was actually spotted by a talent scout while she was lunching in a Beverly Hills restaurant.

She did, however, have good roles in such films as Payment on Demand (1951) with Bette Davis, 99 River Street (1953) with John Payne, I, the Jury (1953), The White Orchid (1954), Miracle in the Rain (1956) with Jane Wyman and in Seven Hills of Rome (1957) with Mario Lanza. After three seasons playing sexy femme lead Lily Merrill, the dance-hall hostess and romantic interest for steely-eyed Marshal Dan Troop in the TV western series Lawman (1958), she left show business in 1962.

The tall, distinguished-looking university graduate boasted a rich, resonant voice, which enabled him to easily find work in radio plays, as well on the stage. He first came to note as a small part actor with the Gate and Abbey Theatre Players, on occasion putting his architectural qualifications to use as a set designer. His first leading role was in Sean O'Casey's play 'Red Roses for Me' in 1944. During one of his performances in Dublin, he was spotted by the director Carol Reed and cast as an IRA terrorist in Odd Man Out (1947). This, and another London-produced film, Hungry Hill (1947), resulted in good critical notices , prompting another genial filmmaker, Orson Welles, to cast O'Herlihy in the role of Macduff for his Mercury/Republic production of Macbeth (1948). While this enterprise was far from successful, O'Herlihy's rugged, bearded appearance for the Scottish play sufficiently impressed Luis Buñuel to cast him in the titular role of Robinson Crusoe (1954). Until the arrival of 'Friday' - the only other featured character - this definitive version of Daniel Defoe's shipwrecked 17th century mariner was a tour-de-force one man show, a compelling, wordless portrayal of agonising solitude. However, since the Mexican production was considered merely a B-movie in Hollywood, O'Herlihy was forced to invest some of his own money to have the film exhibited in Los Angeles. While he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination, few worthy job offers came his way. For the remainder of the decade, he worked under short-term contracts as a character actor (often billed as 'Daniel O'Herlihy') for Universal and 20th Century Fox, typically cast in costume dramas like The Black Shield of Falworth (1954), The Purple Mask (1955) and The Virgin Queen (1955). When movie roles became scarce, he branched out into anthology television, eventually becoming a much sought-after guest star on popular prime time shows like The Untouchables (1959), Bonanza (1959) and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964). Work on radio shows, like 'Johnny Dollar', 'Suspense' and 'Lux Radio Theatre', also continued to provide him with a steady source of income. From the mid-1960's, he was afforded several better film opportunities: first, in a memorable dual role as the sinister, voyeuristic Dr. Caligari, and the handsome psychiatrist treating repressed mental patient Jane Lindstrom (Glynis Johns), in Robert Bloch's off-beat psycho-thriller, The Cabinet of Caligari (1962). Secondly, giving an absolutely mesmerizing performance, as an anguished Air Force general contemplating orders to drop a hydrogen bomb over New York, in Sidney Lumet's gripping anti-war drama Fail-Safe (1964). He was also, among later big screen appearances, one of many name actors in the star-studded military epic Waterloo (1970) (as Napoleon's Marshal Ney); unrecognisable in make-up as a reptilian alien in the 'Star Wars' clone The Last Starfighter (1984); as irredeemable villains in Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) and RoboCop (1987); and as the inscrutable Andrew Packard in Twin Peaks (1990) on TV. O'Herlihy continued to alternate film work with acting on stage in Los Angeles and at the Abbey Theater. He died in February 2005 at the age of 85, leaving his papers to the care of the University College Dublin, from where he had obtained his degree in architecture way back in 1945.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNjYxOTEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA3NTUwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0641397","name":"Dan O'Herlihy","idIMDB":"nm0641397"},"actorId":"nm0641397","character":"Mr. Ohman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Bice","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0080948","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MzgzMzgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUxNDY2MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 March 1914","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","birthName":"Robert Lee Bice","bio":"Robert Bice was born on March 4, 1914 in Dallas, Texas, USA as Robert Lee Bice.
