He is the son of Marjorie (Percival) and Thomas Wilkinson. Economic hardships forced his family to move to Canada for a few years when Wilkinson was a child; after he had returned to England, he attended and graduated from the University of Kent at Canterbury with a degree in English and American Literature. Wilkinson first became active in film and television in the mid-1970s, but did not become familiar to an international audience until 1997. That was when he starred as one of six unemployed workers who strip for cash in Best Picture nominee The Full Monty (1997), and he went on to win a BAFTA for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. That same year, he was featured in Oscar and Lucinda (1997) and Wilde (1997). Wilkinson was also shown to memorable effect as a theatre financier with acting aspirations in Best Picture winner Shakespeare in Love (1998). Over the next few years, Wilkinson would become more popular, especially with American audiences, with such roles as General Cornwallis alongside Mel Gibson in the blockbuster The Patriot (2000) and as the grief-stricken father, Matt Fowler, in the critically acclaimed Best Picture nominee In the Bedroom (2001). For his role in that movie, he received a nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Since then, Wilkinson has made memorable appearances in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Batman Begins (2005), The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005), Valkyrie (2008), Duplicity (2009), The Ghost Writer (2010), The Debt (2010) and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), among others. Wilkinson also received his second Academy Award nomination for his acclaimed role in Michael Clayton (2007). Wilkinson won an Emmy Award for his work as Benjamin Franklin in HBO's John Adams (2008) mini-series. The same year, he received an Emmy nomination for his role in HBO movie Recount (2008), and has also received Emmy nominations for Normal (2003) and Les Kennedy (2011). Wilkinson has two children, Alice and Molly, with wife Diana Hardcastle.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNzc0NzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI1NDA2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929489","name":"Tom Wilkinson","idIMDB":"nm0929489"},"actorId":"nm0929489","character":"Graham Dashwood","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0351090","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Pearson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0669351","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 August 1956","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Patrick Pearson was born on August 21, 1956 in London, England.

He was born William Francis Nighy on December 12, 1949 in Caterham, Surrey, England, to Catherine Josephine (Whittaker), a psychiatric nurse from Glasgow, and Alfred Martin Nighy, who was English-born and managed a garage in Croydon. At school, he gained 'O'-levels in English Language and English Literature and enjoyed reading, particularly Ernest Hemingway. On leaving school he wanted to become a journalist but didn't have the required qualifications. He eventually went on to work as a messenger boy for the Field magazine. He stayed in Paris for a while because he wanted to write \"the great novel\", but he only managed to write the title. When he ran out of money, the British consul shipped him home. Nighy wound up training at Guildford School of Dance and Drama in London, and has since then worked consistently in film, television, and on stage. Nighy is perhaps best-known to international audiences for his memorable performance as washed-up pop singer Billy Mack in Love Actually (2003), which won him a BAFTA for best supporting actor. He has also made appearances in major franchises: he played vampire leader Viktor in Underworld (2003), Underworld: Evolution (2006) and Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009), did the performance capture and voice for Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), and made a brief appearance as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010). Nighy's recent film credits include roles in I Capture the Castle (2003), Shaun of the Dead (2004), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), The Constant Gardener (2005), Notes on a Scandal (2006), Hot Fuzz (2007), Valkyrie (2008) and Pirate Radio (2009). He has also provided voice work for many animated movies in the past few years including Flushed Away (2006), Astro Boy (2009), Rango (2011) and Arthur Christmas (2011). With supporting turns in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), La colère des Titans (2012) and Total Recall (2012), 2012 was a busy year for Nighy. There are no signs of slowing down either, as he next appeared in Jack the Giant Slayer (2013), About Time (2013), and I, Frankenstein (2014). Nighy has also had an active career on the small screen, beginning with Agony (1979), and his first widely-recognized role was in 1991 mini-series The Men's Room (1991). He has also made a habit of working on television with Harry Potter director David Yates: projects together include State of Play (2003), The Young Visiters (2003), The Girl in the Café (2005) and Page Eight (2011). Nighy won a Golden Globe for his performance in Gideon's Daughter (2005). Nighy actually began his career on the stage, and has earned acclaim for his work in numerous plays including \"The Vertical Hour,\" \"Pravda\". \"A Map of the World\", Tom Stoppard's Arcadia in 1993, and David Hare's Skylight. He received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance in 2001 play \"Blue/Orange.\" Bill's partner was actress Diana Quick (he asked her to marry him but she said: \"don't ask me again\"; he called her his wife because anything else would have been too difficult). They have a daughter, Mary Nighy, who is studying at university and contemplating an acting career. She has already begun to appear on TV dramas and radio programs.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NzYwMDAxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg2ODg2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0631490","name":"Bill Nighy","idIMDB":"nm0631490"},"actorId":"nm0631490","character":"Douglas Ainslie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0292155","main":true},{"actorName":"Penelope Wilton","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934362","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwMjk3MDkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU5OTczNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 June 1946","placeOfBirth":" Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Penelope Alice Wilton","bio":"Penelope Wilton was born on June 3, 1946 in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England as Penelope Alice Wilton.

She is known for her appearances with Victoria Wood; including Claire in Pat and Margaret (1994), Philippa Moorcroft in Dinnerladies (1998-2000) and playing various characters in the sketch show Victoria Wood As Seen On TV (1985-87), including Miss Babs in the spoof soap opera sketches Acorn Antiques. She reprised the role of Miss Babs in Acorn Antiques: The Musical! in 2005, and won the Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance in a Musical. Imrie's other television roles include Marianne Bellshade in Bergerac (1983), Diana Neal in After You've Gone (2007-08), Gloria Millington in Kingdom (2007-09), and Miss Kizlet in the 2013 Doctor Who season opener The Bells of Saint John.

She has been described as \"one of the most successful British actresses of recent decades\". Imrie was born in 1952 in Guildford, Surrey, the fourth of five children of Diana Elizabeth Blois (née Cator) and David Andrew Imrie, a radiologist. Her father was from Glasgow, Scotland. Imrie was educated at Guildford High School, an independent school for girls in her hometown of Guildford, followed by the Guildford School of Acting. Imrie's varied career spans films, television and radio drama, and the theatre. Her film credits include Nanny McPhee, Hilary and Jackie (playing Iris du Pré) and the 1997 film of The Borrowers where she played Homily Clock. Other films include Bridget Jones's Diary, Calendar Girls, Highlander and, as Fighter Pilot Bravo 5, in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. In 2004, Imrie played Doctor Imogen Reed in the schoolgirl thriller, Out of Bounds. In 2007 Imrie appeared in St Trinian's. Television series to feature Imrie include The Nightmare Man, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Casualty, Absolutely Fabulous, \"Bergerac\",The Darling Buds of May and Upstairs, Downstairs. In the 2000 miniseries of Gormenghast, she played Lady Gertrude. She also had a guest appearance in an episode of the BBC Scotland sitcom Still Game in 2003, where she played a home help called Mrs Begg. She also appeared in the 2005 BBC television drama Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle, playing the part of a teacher taking an unruly party of pupils on a day-trip to Salisbury Cathedral. She starred in the BBC sitcom, After You've Gone, alongside Nicholas Lyndhurst and in the ITV1 drama Kingdom, with Stephen Fry. Her part in After You've Gone has, whilst being critically acclaimed, been described as \"criminally squandered\". In 2013 she guest starred in the BBC's Doctor Who where she played the villainous Miss Kizlet in the series opener The Bells of Saint John. Her radio work includes parts in BBC Radio 4's No Commitments, Adventures of a Black Bag, and Bleak Expectations. In early 2007, she narrated the book Arabella, broadcast over two weeks as the Book at Bedtime. In May 2016, she made her US television debut in the DC action-adventure series Legends of Tomorrow. Imrie is perhaps best known for her frequent collaborations with Victoria Wood, with whom she has appeared in TV programmes such as the sitcom Dinnerladies and sketch show Victoria Wood As Seen On TV. It was on the latter show in 1985 that she first played the infamous part of Miss Babs, owner of Acorn Antiques, a parody of the low budget British soap opera Crossroads. These sketches became such a British institution that the show was turned into a West End musical in 2005 starring most of the original cast (see the picture on the right). Imrie won an Olivier Award for her performance. The character has curly blonde hair, and is known for her frequent parodic flirtations with the customers, and her abuse of the housekeeper Mrs Overall (portrayed by Julie Walters). Imrie was the guest on Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 on 13 February 2011. On 18 October 2013 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2ODkzOTE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAwODA2NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0408309","name":"Celia Imrie","nicknames":["Impie","Ceals","Celia Impie"],"idIMDB":"nm0408309"},"actorId":"nm0408309","character":"Madge Hardcastle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0416672","main":true},{"actorName":"Simon Wilson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1084508","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Simon Wilson is an actor, known for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), Now Is Good (2012) and The Girl in the Café (2005).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1084508","name":"Simon Wilson","idIMDB":"nm1084508"},"actorId":"nm1084508","character":"Madge's Son-in-Law","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sara Stewart","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829815","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYwNTMzODU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkzMjAzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 June 1966","placeOfBirth":" Edinburgh, Scotland, UK","birthName":"Sara Scott Griffith","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Sara was born and raised in Edinburgh Scotland.
