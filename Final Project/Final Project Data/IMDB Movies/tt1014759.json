He was born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky, on June 9, 1963, to Betty Sue (Wells), who worked as a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer. Depp was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named 'The Kids'. However, it was when he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) that he took up the job of being a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp's film debut in the low-budget horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger. In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987). In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward Scissorhands (1990). Following the film's success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut's Wife (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane. Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez's \"mariachi\" trilogy, Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film's enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Secret Window (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Finding Neverland (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), and later in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Dark Shadows (2012). Off-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss. He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with French singer/actress Vanessa Paradis: Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and Jack, born in 2002. He married actress/producer Amber Heard in 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0ODU5Nzk2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI2ODgyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136","name":"Johnny Depp","nicknames":["Mr. Stench","Colonel"],"idIMDB":"nm0000136"},"actorId":"nm0000136","character":"Mad Hatter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012251","main":true},{"actorName":"Mia Wasikowska","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1985859","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNzI0MDczN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ0MjMxOTE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 October 1989","placeOfBirth":" Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Mia is an Australian actress, born and raised in the country's capital, Canberra.

Bonham Carter was born May 26, 1966 in Golders Green, London, England, the youngest of three children of Elena (née Propper de Callejón), a psychotherapist, and Raymond Bonham Carter, a merchant banker. Through her father, she is the great-granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert H. Asquith, and her blue-blooded family tree also contains Barons and Baronesses, diplomats, and a director, Bonham Carter's great-uncle Anthony Asquith, who made Pygmalion (1938) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), among others. Cousin Crispin Bonham-Carter is also an actor. Her maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callejón, was a Spanish diplomat who was awarded the honorific Righteous Among the Nations, by Israel, for helping save Jews during World War II (Eduardo's own father was a Czech Jew). Helena's maternal grandmother, Hélène Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family from France, Austria, and Germany, and later converted to her husband's Catholic faith. Bonham Carter experiencing family dramas during her childhood, including her father's stroke - which left him wheelchair-bound. She attended South Hampstead High School and Westminster School in London, and subsequently devoted herself to an acting career. That trajectory actually began in 1979 when, at age thirteen, she entered a national poetry writing competition and used her second place winnings to place her photo in the casting directory \"Spotlight.\" She soon had her first agent and her first acting job, in a commercial, at age sixteen. She then landed a role in the made-for-TV movie A Pattern of Roses (1983), which subsequently led to her casting in the Merchant Ivory films A Room with a View (1985), director James Ivory's tasteful adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel, and Lady Jane (1986), giving a strong performance as the uncrowned Queen of England. She had roles in three other productions under the Merchant-Ivory banner (director Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala): an uncredited appearance in Maurice (1987), and large roles in Where Angels Fear to Tread (1991) and Howards End (1992). Often referred to as the \"corset queen\" or \"English rose\" because of her early work, Bonham Carter continued to surprise audiences with magnificent performances in a variety of roles from her more traditional corset-clad character in The Wings of the Dove (1997) and Shakespearian damsels to the dark and neurotic anti-heroines of Fight Club (1999). Her acclaimed performance in The Wings of the Dove (1997) earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination, a BAFTA Best Actress nomination, and a SAG Awards Best Actress nomination. It also won her a Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics, the Boston Society Film Critics, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Texas Society of Film Critics, and the Southeastern Film Critics Association. In the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late '90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson's Live from Baghdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass' The Theory of Flight (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn's La nuit des rois (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his Mighty Aphrodite (1995); Mort Ransen's Margaret's Museum (1995); Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990). Other notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O'Sullivan's The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Big Fish (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch. In between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann's Miami Vice (1984) as Don Johnson's junkie fiancée, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall's heart in Dancing Queen (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White. Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton's film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton's massive hit Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton's spooky Corpse Bride (2005), and co-starring in Conversations with Other Women (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart. Since their meeting while filming Planet of the Apes (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton have made seven movies together. They live in adjoining residences in London, sharing a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, 4, and Nell Burton, who was born December 15, 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair. Despite that, Bonham Carter has said in numerous interviews that her audition process for the role of Mrs. Lovett was the most grueling of her career and that, ultimately, it was Sondheim who she had to convince that she was right for the role.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzUzMDg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA5NDMwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000307","name":"Helena Bonham Carter","idIMDB":"nm0000307"},"actorId":"nm0000307","character":"Red Queen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0465284","main":true},{"actorName":"Anne Hathaway","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ5MTAxMDc5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0OTE4OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 November 1982","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Anne Jacqueline Hathaway","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Anne Jacqueline Hathaway was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Kate McCauley Hathaway, an actress, and Gerald T. Hathaway, a lawyer, both originally from Philadelphia. She is of mostly Irish descent, along with English, German, and French. Her first major role came in the short-lived television series Get Real (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in The Princess Diaries (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she is a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo. She also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of \"Christine\" in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn't take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum. Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her \"Princess Diaries\" image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn't mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ5MTAxMDc5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0OTE4OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266","name":"Anne Hathaway","nicknames":["Annie"],"idIMDB":"nm0004266"},"actorId":"nm0004266","character":"White Queen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012249","main":true},{"actorName":"Crispin Glover","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000417","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMDQ1NzE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1NjU4Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 April 1964","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Crispin Hellion Glover","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"While he's never been a typical leading man, Crispin Glover has distinguished himself as one of the most intriguing personalities in the movie business. His unusual characters and personal projects have inspired a cult-like following that has dubbed him both madman and genius. The son of actor Bruce Glover, Crispin Hellion Glover was born in New York City and raised in Southern California. He picked up his father's trade while still in elementary school--by age 13, he already had an agent scouting out parts. A lead in a stage production of \"The Sound of Music\" (starring Florence Henderson) led to guest spots on the TV shows Happy Days (1974), Hill Street Blues (1981) and Family Ties (1982), which in turn led to roles in made-for-TV movies. The adolescent Glover felt \"confined\" by TV work, however, so he opted to stick to movie parts. He made his big-screen debut in the teen hi-jinx movie in My Tutor (1983), then followed up with a supporting role in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984). Glover's most defining Hollywood moment happened the next year, when he appeared as George McFly (Michael J. Fox's father) in the instant classic Back to the Future (1985). The underdog character struck a chord with moviegoers. Oddly enough, the actor delivered one of his favorite performances around the same time - playing a small-town kid obsessed with Olivia Newton-John in the indie The Orkly Kid (1985)--but the smaller film was completely overshadowed by his commercial success. Glover did, however, receive critical praise for his next indie role, a starring turn as a high-strung murder witness in River's Edge (1986). Glover and the producers did not come to a financial agreement for him to reprise the role of George McFly in Back to the Future Part II (1989). The producers brought the character back to life by splicing together archived footage and new scenes (using an actor in prosthetic makeup). Glover, who hadn't given permission for his likeness to be used, sued the film's producer, Steven Spielberg, and won. The case prompted the Screen Actors Guild to devise new regulations about the use of actors' images. In 1990 Glover teamed up with fellow eccentric David Lynch to play the maniacal Cousin Dell in Wild at Heart (1990). He filled the next decade with similarly quirky, peripheral roles, including a turn as Andy Warhol in The Doors (1991) and a cameo as a train fireman in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man (1995). His small but memorable appearances in films like What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) often outshone the main action. When he's not stealing scenes from Hollywood hotshots, Glover pours his considerable energy into other creative endeavors. He wrote his first book, \"Billow Rock\", before age 18, and since then he's gone on to create a library of peculiar titles (several of which have been published through his family's Volcanic Eruptions press). Among his most famous volumes are \"Rat Catching\" and \"Oak-Mot\", both Victorian-era stories updated with macabre illustrations and cut-up text. In 1989 he released an album of spoken word readings and cover tunes (including a rendition of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\") entitled \"The Big Problem [does not equal] the Solution. The Solution = Let it be.\" In 1995 Glover began shooting his directorial debut, What Is It? (2005), a surreal film populated entirely by actors with Down's Syndrome. He tours with the film and it's sequel It is fine. Everything is fine! and his show, \"Crispin Hellion Glover's Big Slide Show,\" which is a one hour dramatic narration of eight different profusely illustrated books. The artist in Glover has been said to be inspired by \"the aesthetic of discomfort,\" a theme which seems to have been carried over into an artistic public performance on David Letterman's NBC show in 1987, Glover emerged wearing a wig and platform shoes, then delivered a swift kick toward Letterman's head that prompted the producers to cut to a commercial. Late 2000 saw him hitting the multiplex with roles in Nurse Betty (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000), and the titular Willard (2003). He re-teamed with Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis as Grendel in Beowulf (2007) and has worked with Johnny Depp for the third time in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010). Other Glover projects loom on the not-too-distant horizon.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMDQ1NzE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1NjU4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000417","name":"Crispin Glover","idIMDB":"nm0000417"},"actorId":"nm0000417","character":"Stayne - Knave of Hearts","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0095387","main":true},{"actorName":"Matt Lucas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524240","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MDE4NzI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE5MjEyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 March 1974","placeOfBirth":" Paddington, London, England, UK","birthName":"Matthew Richard Lucas","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Matt Lucas was born on March 5, 1974 in Paddington, London, England as Matthew Richard Lucas.

Sheen was born in Newport, Wales, the only son of Irene (Thomas) and Meyrick Sheen. The charming, curly-haired actor grew up a middle-class boy in the working-class town of Port Talbot, Wales. Although his parents worked in personnel, they shared with their son a deep appreciation for acting, with Meyrick Sheen enjoying some success later in life as a Jack Nicholson impersonator. As a young man, Michael Sheen turned down the opportunity to pursue a possible professional football career, opting to follow in the footsteps of Daniel Day-Lewis and Patrick Stewart by attending the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School instead of university. In his second year, he won the coveted Laurence Olivier Bursary for consistently outstanding performances. While Sheen was still studying, he landed a pivotal role opposite stage legend Vanessa Redgrave in Martin Sherman's \"When She Danced\" (1991). He left school early to make his West End debut and has been dazzling audiences and critics with his intense and passionate performances ever since. Among his most memorable roles were \"Romeo\" in \"Romeo and Juliet\", the title role in Yukio Ninagawa's 1994 Royal Shakespeare Company's staging of \"Peer Gynt\" and \"Jimmy Porter\" both in a 1994 regional staging in a 1999 London revival of \"Look Back in Anger\". A critic from the London Times panned the multimedia production of \"Peer Gynt\", but praised Sheen for his ability to express \"astonishing vitality despite lifeless direction\". Referring to Sheen's performance in \"Look Back in Anger\", Susannah Clapp of The Observer hailed him for his \"luminous quality\" and ability to be goaded and fiery and defensive all at the same time. Sheen also managed to set critics' tongues wagging with a deft performance in the role of \"Henry V\", not a part traditionally given to a slight, boyish-looking actor. One writer raved: \"Sheen, volatile and responsive in an excellent performance, showed us the exhilaration of power and conquest\". In 1993, Sheen joined the troupe \"Cheek By Jowl\" and was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award for his performance in \"Don't Fool with Love\". That same year, he excelled as a mentally unstable man who becomes enmeshed in a kidnapping plot in Mystery!: Gallowglass (1993), a three-part BBC serial that aired in the USA on PBS' \"Mystery!\" in 1995. The actor nabbed his first feature film role in 1994, playing Dr. Jekyll's footman in Mary Reilly (1996) opposite John Malkovich and Julia Roberts, but that film did not make it into theaters until 1996, a year after Sheen's second movie, Othello (1995), was filmed and released. Perhaps his most memorable big screen role at that point, however, was \"Robert Ross\", Oscar Wilde's erstwhile lover, in the 1997 biopic Wilde (1997). He would also be seen in the Brit road film Heartlands (2002) opposite Mark Addy. Hot off the success of \"Amadeus\", Sheen began racking up even more notable big screen credits, starring opposite Heath Ledger, Wes Bentley and Kate Hudson in The Four Feathers (2002) and landing a major role opposite Kate Beckinsale in the action-horror blockbuster Underworld (2003), along with supporting turns in Bright Young Things (2003), Timeline (2003) and as British Prime Minister Tony Blair in director Stephen Frears' film The Queen (2006). Next, Sheen grabbed good notices played a divorce-embattled rock star, stealing scenes from Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore in the romantic comedy Une affaire de coeur (2004). Back on the stage, the actor earned raves for his performance as \"Caligula\" in London, for which he won the Evening Standard Award and Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, along with a nomination for the prestigious Laurence Olivier Award.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MjI4NjY2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgwNjQzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790688","name":"Michael Sheen","idIMDB":"nm0790688"},"actorId":"nm0790688","character":"White Rabbit","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0088704","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephen Fry","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000410","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTEyNzc0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQwNDk0NjE@._V1_UY44_CR12,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 August 1957","placeOfBirth":" Hampstead, London, England, UK","birthName":"Stephen John Fry","height":"6' 4½\" (1.94 m)","bio":"Writer, actor, comedian, doer of good works, excellent good friend to the famous and not, Fry lives in his London SW1 flat and his Norfolk house when not traveling.

His maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jewish immigrants, while his father's family was of English background. He grew up in Norfolk and attended Uppingham School and Stout's Hill.

While at Cambridge, he was a member of the Cherubs drinking club, and Footlights with Thompson, Tony Slattery, Martin Bergman, and Hugh Laurie (to whom he was introduced by E.T.). His prolific writing partnership with Laurie began in 1981 with resulting Footlights revues for (among others) Mayweek, Edinburgh Festival, and a three month tour of Australia. In 1984, Fry was engaged to do the rewrite of the Noel Gay musical \"Me and My Girl,\" which made him a millionaire before the age of 30. It also earned him a nomination for a Tony award in 1987.

Throughout the 1980s, Fry did a huge amount of television and radio work, as well as writing for newspapers (e.g. a weekly column in the \"Daily Telegraph\") and magazines (e.g. articles for \"Arena\"). He is probably best known for his television roles in Black-Adder II (1986) and Jeeves and Wooster (1990). His support of the Terence Higgins Trust through events such as the first \"Hysteria\" benefit, as well as numerous other charity efforts, are probably those works of which he is most proud. Fry's acting career has not been limited to films and television. He had successful runs in Alan Bennett's \"Forty Years On,\" Simon Gray's \"The Common Pursuit\" with John Sessions, Rik Mayall, John Gordon Sinclair, and others. Michael Frayn's \"Look Look\" and Gray's \"Cell Mates\" were less successful for both Fry and their playwrights, the latter not helped by his walking out of the play after only a couple of weeks. Fry has published four novels as well as a collection of his radio and journalistic miscellanea. He has recorded audiotapes of his novels (an unabridged version of \"The Liar\" was released in 1995), as well as many other works for both adults and children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTEyNzc0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQwNDk0NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000410","name":"Stephen Fry","idIMDB":"nm0000410"},"actorId":"nm0000410","character":"Cheshire Cat","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012248","main":true},{"actorName":"Alan Rickman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000614","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNTc4MTg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY2MjkxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 February 1946","placeOfBirth":" Hammersmith, London, England, UK","birthName":"Alan Sidney Patrick Rickman","height":"6' 0¾\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Alan Rickman was born on a council estate in Acton, West London, to Margaret Doreen Rose (Bartlett) and Bernard Rickman, who worked at a factory. He had English, Irish, and Welsh ancestry. Alan had an older brother David, a younger brother Michael and a younger sister Sheila. When Alan was 8 years old, his father died. He attended Latymer Upper School on a scholarship. He studied Graphic Design at Chelsea College of Art and Design, where he met Rima Horton, who would later become his life partner. After three years at Chelsea College, Rickman did graduate studies at the Royal College of Art. He opened a successful graphics design business, Graphiti, with friends and ran it for several years before his love of theatre led him to seek an audition with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). At the relatively late age of 26, Rickman received a scholarship to RADA, which started a professional acting career that has lasted nearly 40 years, a career which has spanned stage, screen and television and lapped over into directing, as well. Rickman first came to the attention of American audiences as \"Vicomte de Valmont\" in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" on Broadway in 1987 (he was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in the role). Denied the role in the film version of the show, Rickman instead made his first movie appearance opposite Bruce Willis in Die Hard (1988) as the villain, \"Hans Gruber\". Rickman's take on the urbane villain set the standard for screen villains for decades to come. Though often cited as being a master of playing villains, Rickman actually played a wide variety of characters, such as the romantic cello-playing ghost \"Jamie\" in Anthony Minghella's Truly Madly Deeply (1990) and the noble \"Colonel Brandon\" of Sense and Sensibility (1995). He treated audiences to his comedic abilities with films like Dogma (1999), Galaxy Quest (1999) and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), and roles like \"Dr. Alfred Blalock\" in Something the Lord Made (2004) and \"Alex Hughes\" in Snow Cake (2006), showcase his ability to play ordinary men in extraordinary situations. Rickman even conquered the daunting task of singing a part in a Stephen Sondheim musical as he took on the part of \"Judge Turpin\" in the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007). In 2001, Rickman introduced himself to a whole new, and younger, generation of fans by taking on the role of \"Severus Snape\" in the movie versions of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). He continued to play the role through the eighth and last movie Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNTc4MTg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY2MjkxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000614","name":"Alan Rickman","idIMDB":"nm0000614"},"actorId":"nm0000614","character":"Blue Caterpillar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012254","main":true},{"actorName":"Barbara Windsor","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934774","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDYxODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc1NjcxNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 August 1937","placeOfBirth":" Shoreditch, London, England, UK","birthName":"Barbara-Ann Deeks","height":"4' 10\" (1.47 m)","bio":"Barbara Windsor got a glimpse of theatrical life at an early age when her grandmother took her backstage at a theatre and she decided that was what she wanted to do. She attended several professional schools before making her stage debut at age 12. At 15 she got a job in the chorus line of a London musical and stayed with the show for the next two years, although she took some minor roles in films during that time. She did become well known in the London theatrical scene, but it was the series of \"Carry On\" comedies that made her a star. Although she appeared in only nine films in the long-running series (she left because she thought they were getting too risqué), she made such an impression as the basically goodhearted but dizzy sexpot that many of the series' fans believe she was in many more than she actually was. She almost didn't get the part originally, as she and series regular Kenneth Williams took an instant dislike to each other, but that was soon overcome and they became lifelong friends. After she left the series she continued her stage and film work, and became a regular in a long-running British soap opera, EastEnders (1985) as the matriarch of \"The Queen Vic\" - \"Peggy Mitchell\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDYxODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc1NjcxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934774","name":"Barbara Windsor","nicknames":["The Queen of Carry On","Barb","Little Bird","One-take Windsor","Babs"],"idIMDB":"nm0934774"},"actorId":"nm0934774","character":"Dormouse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0446699","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Whitehouse","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925768","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU5ODcwMjQ3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ5MjEyMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 May 1958","placeOfBirth":" Stanleytown, Rhondda, Wales, UK","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Paul Whitehouse was born on May 17, 1958 in Stanleytown, Rhondda, Wales.

His father is Hungarian and his mother is Australian (of English, Irish, and Danish origin). He inherited some of his talents from his father, a trained opera singer and at one time, a trapeze artist in the Hungarian Circus. His academic training began at Canterbury University, Christchurch, New Zealand, where he commenced a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in Art History, and then transferred to, Te Kura Toi Whakaari o Aotearoa/ The New Zealand Drama School, graduating in December, 1989. His first acting role was in Te Whanau a Tuanui Jones by Apairana Taylor at the Taki Rua Theatre in Wellington New Zealand, (1990). He has since had an eclectic career of theatre, television and film. He appeared in the 1994 movie Jack Brown Genius (1996) in which he played the role of Dennis. After starring for 2 years in the New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street (1992), he starred in the 1996 movie Broken English (1996) as Darko. After performing in a great number of theatrical plays, writing his own and co-founding his own theatre company, the Stronghold Theatre, Marton got the role of Tarlus in an episode of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995). After that, he continued working with Renaissance Pictures, playing the roles of Khrafstar and Borias in the 1997-1998 seasons of Xena: Warrior Princess (1995). He continued appearing in many other shows in both NZ and Australia, such as Farscape (1999), BeastMaster, le dernier des survivants (1999), Brigade des mers (1996), Cleopatra 2525 (2000), and more, returning for the role of Borias in three episodes of the 2000-2001 season of Xena: Warrior Princess (1995).

He is a citizen of the European Union and Hungary, and is a permanent resident of the United States. Most recently, Csokas starred opposite Denzel Washington in Sony's hit film The Equalizer.

Some of his other film credits include 2010's The Debt opposite Jessica Chastain and Paul Greengrass' The Bourne Supremacy with Matt Damon. His depth of experience is illustrated in Asylum in which he starred opposite Natasha Richardson and Ian McKellen, as well as the Ridley Scott epic, Kingdom of Heaven, with Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson and Liam Neeson. On the small screen, Csokas recently starred on the History Channel's miniseries Sons of Liberty as well as Discovery Channel's miniseries Klondike with Tim Roth and Sam Shepard.

Predominantly a stage player in both regional and repertory, he made his Broadway debut in \"Sherlock Holmes\" as Dr. Watson in 1974. Over the years, he has appeared opposite England's theatre royalty including Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Geraldine James, Margaret Tyzack, and Patrick Stewart. He was invited by an ailing Sir Anthony Quayle to take over the running of the Compass theatre company founded by him in 1984 and Piggot-Smith served as its artistic director from 1989-1992. In addition, he has directed several major productions including \"Hamlet\" and \"A Royal Hunt of the Sun.\" He has taken several Shakespearean classics to TV, including his Hotspur in \"Henry IV, Part I\" and Angelo in \"Measure for Measure,\" and delivered impressive performances in such prestigious mini-series productions as \"Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years,\" \"Fame Is the Spur\" and \"The Jewel in the Crown.\" Lesser known for his body of film work, such movies as Aces High (1976), his film debut, Joseph Andrews (1977), Victory (1981), Clash of the Titans (1981), State of Emergency (1986), Remains of the Day (1993), and Martin Scorcese's Gangs of New York (2002) have yet given him that necessary breakout role.
