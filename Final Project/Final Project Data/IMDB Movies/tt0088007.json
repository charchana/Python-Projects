They and many of their neighbors have hit hard times of late. A downturn in the economy has led to dwindling land prices. But the biggest problem of late has been that their crop land has been prone to flooding as the property is adjacent to a river. Manipulating the powers that be including a local senator and the local bank, Joe Wade, who also grew up in the area and now runs the local milling company that sets the local grain prices, is working behind the scenes to buy up the properties along the river for a song as he wants to build a dam which would flood the Garvey's and others riverfront properties. The dam would generate electricity, but more importantly for Joe it would provide irrigation opportunities for farm properties away from the river, such as his own. Tom already intensely dislikes Joe as he and Mae used to go together. ...","simplePlot":"A farming family battles severe storms, a bank is threatening to repossess their farm, and there are other hard times in a battle to save and hold on to their farm.","actors":[{"actorName":"Mel Gibson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000154","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUzOTMwNTM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMTUxMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 January 1956","placeOfBirth":" Peekskill, New York, USA","birthName":"Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson was born January 3, 1956 in Peekskill, New York, USA, as the sixth of eleven children of Hutton Gibson, a railroad brakeman, and Anne Patricia (Reilly) Gibson (who died in December of 1990). His mother was Irish, from County Longford, while his American-born father is of mostly Irish descent. Mel and his family moved to Australia in the late 1960s, settling in New South Wales, where Mel's paternal grandmother, contralto opera singer Eva Mylott, was born. After high school, Mel studied at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, performing at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts alongside future film thespians Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush. After college, Mel had a few stints on stage and starred in a few TV shows. Eventually, he was chosen to star in Mad Max (1979) and in a movie called Tim (1979), co-starring Piper Laurie. The small budgeted movie Mad Max (1979) made him known worldwide, while Tim (1979) garnered him an award for Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute (equivalent to the Oscar). Later, he went on to star in Gallipoli (1981), which earned him a second award for Best Actor from the AFI. In 1980, he married Robyn Moore and had seven children. In 1984, Mel made his American debut in The Bounty (1984), which co-starred Anthony Hopkins. Then in 1987, Mel starred in what would become his signature series, Lethal Weapon (1987), in which he played \"Martin Riggs\". In 1990, he took on the interesting starring role in Hamlet (1990), which garnered him some critical praise. He also made the more endearing Forever Young (1992) and the somewhat disturbing The Man Without a Face (1993). 1995 brought his most famous role as \"Sir William Wallace\" in Braveheart (1995), for which he won two Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. From there, he made such box office hits as The Patriot (2000), Ransom (1996), and Payback (1999). Today, Mel remains an international superstar mogul, continuously topping the Hollywood power lists as well as the Most Beautiful and Sexiest lists.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUzOTMwNTM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMTUxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000154","name":"Mel Gibson","idIMDB":"nm0000154"},"actorId":"nm0000154","character":"Tom Garvey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0144901","main":true},{"actorName":"Sissy Spacek","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAwMTU4NTMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyMTg4MTE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 December 1949","placeOfBirth":" Quitman, Texas, USA","birthName":"Mary Elizabeth Spacek","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"As a kid, Sissy Spacek climbed trees, rode horses, swam, and played in the woods. She was born Mary Elizabeth Spacek on December 25, 1949, in Quitman, Texas, to Virginia Frances (Spilman) and Edwin Arnold Spacek, Sr., a county agricultural agent. Her father's family was of Czech and German origin. Sissy attended Quitman High School and was homecoming queen. After graduating, she embarked on an acting career, gaining interest in the profession through her cousin, actor Rip Torn. Sissy relocated to New York, and through him, enrolled in the New York branch of the Actors Studio. She studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Institute while also pursuing work as a model and singer, appearing in West Village showcases such as the Bitter End for $10 a night. Sissy eventually broke into film and one of her first roles was as Holly in the classic Badlands (1973). The art director on that film was Jack Fisk, with whom she would marry in 1974 and ultimately collaborate on eight films. Sissy followed this landmark film with a star-making and Oscar nominated performance in Carrie (1976), in which she played a humiliated prom queen who goes postal with her telekinesis. Sissy has had an enduring and award winning career in movies and television, which includes an Oscar as Best Actress for Coal Miner's Daughter (1980). The parents of two grown daughters, Sissy and Jack live on a large horse ranch in the foothills of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. Even though she continued to appear in film and television during the late 1980s and 1990s, Sissy devoted most of those years to her family. Then, in 2001, Sissy returned to the big screen in a major way with a powerful performance in In the Bedroom (2001), which not only earned her a sixth Best Actress Oscar nomination, but a win for Best Actress at the Golden Globes, Independent Spirit Awards, and numerous critics association awards. Sissy continues to work steadily as an actress, but in 2012, her credits expanded even further to include a memoir, My Extraordinary Ordinary Life, as well as planning her directorial debut on the in-development film Sweet Tea.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAwMTU4NTMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyMTg4MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651","name":"Sissy Spacek","idIMDB":"nm0000651"},"actorId":"nm0000651","character":"Mae Garvey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shane Bailey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047490","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Shane Bailey is an actor, known for The River (1984) and Chattahoochee (1989).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047490","name":"Shane Bailey","idIMDB":"nm0047490"},"actorId":"nm0047490","character":"Lewis Garvey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Becky Jo Lynch","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528236","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Becky Jo Lynch is an actress, known for The River (1984).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0528236","name":"Becky Jo Lynch","idIMDB":"nm0528236"},"actorId":"nm0528236","character":"Beth Garvey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Scott Glenn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001277","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzAwMzE1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjkzOTY0._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 January 1941","placeOfBirth":" Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"Theodore Scott Glenn","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Scott Glenn was born January 26, 1941, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Elizabeth and Theodore Glenn, a salesman. As he grew up in Appalachia, his health was poor; he was bedridden for a year and doctors predicted he would limp for the rest of his life. During long periods of illness, Glenn was reading a lot and \"dreaming of becoming Lord Byron\". He challenged his illness by intense training programs and eventually got rid of his limp. Glenn entered William and Mary College where he majored in English. He spent three years in the Marines and then tried to combine his passion for storytelling with his passion for adventures by working for five months as a criminal reporter at the Kenosha Evening News. Glenn planned to become an author but found out he had \"problems with dialogs\", so he decided to overcome it by studying acting. In 1966, he headed to New York where he joined George Morrison acting class. He helped in directing student plays to pay for his studies and appeared onstage in La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club productions. Soon after arriving in New York, Glenn became a fan of martial arts. In 1968, he joined The Actors Studio and began working in professional theater and TV. In 1970, James Bridges offered him his first movie work in The Baby Maker (1970). Glenn left for L.A., where he spent seven of the \"most miserable years of [his] life\". He couldn't find interesting film roles and, doing brief TV stints, he felt \"like a person who had to paint the Sistine Chapel with a house-painter's brush\". On a brighter side, he worked episodically with Jonathan Demme (Angels Hard as They Come (1971), Fighting Mad (1976)), Robert Altman (Nashville (1975)) and Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now (1979)). In 1978, Glenn got tired of Hollywood and moved his family to Ketchum, Idaho, where he worked as a barman, huntsman and mountain ranger for two years (occasionally acting in Seattle stage productions). James Bridges once more changed the course of Glenn's life in 1980 when he offered him the role of John Travolta's rival in Urban Cowboy (1980) and made him a star. Glenn's acting abilities and physical presence helped him to excel both in action (Silverado (1985), The Challenge (1982)) and drama (The Right Stuff (1983), Countdown to Looking Glass (1984), The River (1984)) as he alternately played good guys and bad guys. In the beginning of the '90s, his career was at its peak - he appeared in such indisputable masterpieces as The Silence of the Lambs (1991), and The Hunt for Red October (1990). Established as one of Hollywood's most solid and respected character actors he has appeared in a wide variety of films, such as the black Freudian farce Reckless (1995), the tragicomedy Edie & Pen (1996) and Ken Loach's socio-political declaration Carla's Song (1996), alternating mainstream (Courage Under Fire (1996), Absolute Power (1997)) with independent projects (Lesser Prophets (1997) and Larga distancia (1998)), written by his daughter Dakota Glenn), and TV (Naked City: A Killer Christmas (1998)). Continuing into the 21st century, Glenn has also appeared in Training Day (2001), W. (2008) (as Donald Rumsfeld), Secretariat (2010), Sucker Punch (2011), The Paperboy (2012), and two of the Bourne films: The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and The Bourne Legacy (2012).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzAwMzE1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjkzOTY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001277","name":"Scott Glenn","idIMDB":"nm0001277"},"actorId":"nm0001277","character":"Joe Wade","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0529900","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Hood","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393458","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 November 1940","placeOfBirth":" Marks, Mississippi, USA","birthName":"Donald Floyd Hood","bio":"Don Hood was born on November 25, 1940 in Marks, Mississippi, USA as Donald Floyd Hood.

Tall, handsome and rangy, Bush often portrayed engaging good ol' boy types, rugged cowboys and stern police officers. He was born as William Warren Bush in 1935. Billy was terrific as lazy hillbilly oil rig worker Elton in Bob Rafelson's wonderful Five Easy Pieces (1970). He was likewise excellent as cop Robert Blake's affably dimwitted partner Zipper in the splendid Electra Glide in Blue (1973). Bush gave another outstanding performance as tough-as-nails trail boss Frank Culpepper in the superbly gritty Western The Culpepper Cattle Co. (1972). Other memorable roles include a hard-nosed sheriff in Welcome Home, Soldier Boys (1971), no-nonsense Warden Earl Gulliver in the powerful made-for-TV movie The Jericho Mile (1979), gruff state trooper Donner in The Hitcher (1986), and resolute farmer Jay Brown in the immensely enjoyable creature feature Critters (1986). Among the TV shows Bush has done guest spots on are Hill Street Blues (1981), The A-Team (1983), CHiPs (1977), The Incredible Hulk (1978), The Dukes of Hazzard (1979), Starsky and Hutch (1975), Baretta (1975), M*A*S*H (1972), Gunsmoke (1955), Banyon (1971), Bonanza (1959), The Outer Limits (1963), and Renegade (1992). Bush also played the sheriff in the ninth installment of the slasher franchise 'Friday the 13th', entitled Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993). He has since retired from acting. Billy is the father of actor Clay Greenbush and twin actresses Sidney Greenbush and Rachel Lindsay Greenbush.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MDgzMDQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM5NjYzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124100","name":"Billy Green Bush","nicknames":["Billy"],"idIMDB":"nm0124100"},"actorId":"nm0124100","character":"Harve Stanley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Tolkan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866055","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDcyNzQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjExNTgyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 June 1931","placeOfBirth":" Calumet, Michigan, USA","birthName":"James Stewart Tolkan","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Fiery, forceful and intimidating character actor James Tolkan has carved out a nice little niche for himself in both movies and television alike as a formidable portrayer of fierce and flinty hard-boiled tough guy types. James Stewart Tolkan was born on June 20, 1931 in Calumet, Michigan. His father, Ralph M. Tolkan, was a cattle dealer. James attended the University of Iowa, Coe College and Eastern Arizona College. After serving a year-long stint in the United States Navy, Tolkan went to New York and studied acting with both Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler at the Actors Studio. Short and bald, with beady, intense eyes, a wiry, compact, muscular build, a gruff, jarring, high-decibel voice, and an aggressive, confrontational, blunt-as-a-battle-ax, rough-around-the-edges demeanor, Tolkan has been often cast as rugged, cynical no-nonsense cops, mean, domineering authority figures, and various ruthless and dangerous criminals. Tolkan first began acting in movies in the late 1960s and was highly effective in two pictures for Sidney Lumet: He was a rabidly homophobic police lieutenant in the superbly gritty Serpico (1973) and a sneaky district attorney in the equally excellent Prince of the City (1981). Best known as the obnoxiously overzealous high school principal Gerard Strickland in the Back to the Future films, Tolkan's other most memorable roles include Napolean in Woody Allen's Love and Death (1975), a ramrod army officer in WarGames (1983), mayor Robert Culp's mordant, wisecracking assistant in Turk 182! (1985), the hard-nosed Stinger in Top Gun (1986), the choleric Detective Lubric in Masters of the Universe (1987), meek mob accountant Numbers in Dick Tracy (1990), and Wesley Snipes' bullish superior in Boiling Point (1993). James has had recurring parts on the television series A Nero Wolfe Mystery (2000) (he also directed two episodes), Mary (1985), Cobra (1993), The Hat Squad (1992) and Remington Steele (1982). Among the television series James has done guest spots on are Naked City (1958), Hill Street Blues (1981), Miami Vice (1984), The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990), The Equalizer (1985), The Wonder Years (1988) and The Pretender (1996). Besides his film and television work, Tolkan has also performed on stage in productions of such plays as \"Between Two Thieves\", \"Wings\", \"One Tennis Shoe\", \"The Front Page\", \"Twelve Angry Men\", \"Full Circle\", \"The Tempest\", \"Golda\", \"The Silent Partner\" and the original 1984 Broadway production of David Mamet's \"Glengary, Glen Ross\". When he isn't acting, James Tolkan spends his spare time collecting folk art.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDcyNzQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjExNTgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866055","name":"James Tolkan","idIMDB":"nm0866055"},"actorId":"nm0866055","character":"Howard Simpson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bob W.
