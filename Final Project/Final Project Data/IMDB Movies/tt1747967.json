After graduating from the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, she took a trip out west with her roommates, finding herself in Los Angeles without enough money to return home. She took a temporary job as a receptionist and signed up for acting classes at night. Soon she was working regularly in television and film, but after marrying producer Jerry Bick and having two sons, the actress took a long hiatus to raise her children. Returning to work in 1974 in Robert Altman's Thieves Like Us (1974), Fletcher came to the attention of director Milos Forman, who was casting the difficult role of the nurse in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). She won the role -- and then the Academy Award -- portraying deadly, inflexible Nurse Ratched, who has since become a cultural icon. Numerous film roles followed, including co-starring turns with Peter Falk in The Cheap Detective (1978) and with Richard Burton in Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977). Fletcher has appeared in a number of science fiction and horror classics such as Firestarter (1984), Brainstorm (1983), and Flowers in the Attic (1987). Though she earned an Emmy Award nomination for her recurring role on Picket Fences (1992), Fletcher is perhaps best known to recent television audiences as Kai Winn from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and as Nora Bloom from the cult classic VR.5 (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzOTcwNzYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjQ3MTI0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001221","name":"Louise Fletcher","idIMDB":"nm0001221"},"actorId":"nm0001221","character":"Claire","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rus Blackwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085952","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDY2NjgwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzExODM3Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 March 1963","placeOfBirth":" Rockford, Illinois, USA","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Rus Blackwell started his acting career in New York, training at Circle in the Square Theatre School and working on stage.
