He tried, unsuccessfully, to get any kind of job and was, he recalls, even rejected as extra for a Crest commercial. When his acting teacher, Dan Fauci, lost the lease to his teaching studio, he rented Fisher's loft and built a stage in the living room. He later studied with Uta Hagen. His first professional theatrical production was playing Tiny Tim's brother, Harry, in the musical version of Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" in the basement of an off-off-off Broadway theatre when he was 14. Since then he has performed in more than 20 stage productions including 544 performances in Harvey Fierstein's \"Torch Song Triology\", both on and off Broadway. He also played Eugene in Neil Simon's \"Brighton Beach Memories\". Most recently, he played the leads in Thomas Babe's \"Carrying School Children\", \"Almost Romance\" opposite Helen Slater and Jules Feiffer's \"Little Murders\" with Christine Lahti. He also sang and danced in the musicals \"Miami\" by Wendy Wasserstein and the late Michael Bennett's Broadway production of \"Scandal\" with Swoosie Kurtz and Treat Williams. He also appeared in the recent New York City Shakespeare Festival production of \"A Midsummer Nights Dream\". Fisher made his motion picture debut getting his fingers chopped off in the horror film The Burning (1981) when he was 16-years-old. After that he appeared in Baby It's You (1983) and The Brother from Another Planet (1984). He co-starred with Matt Dillon in the hit comedy film The Flamingo Kid (1984) where he met the then fledgling producer Gary Foster. He appeared as sidekick to Steve Guttenberg's character in Short Circuit (1986). In television he has performed in ABC's Ryan's Hope (1975), Showtime's Tall Tales & Legends (1985) and CBS' Early Edition (1996). Despite having lived in New York City for more than a decade, where, with some other actors, Stevens has started an off-off-off Broadway theatre company called Naked Angels, he insists that he is still a fan of the Chicago Cubs.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MTE2NTMxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjkwMDM0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001770","name":"Fisher Stevens","idIMDB":"nm0001770"},"actorId":"nm0001770","character":"Ben Jahveri","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013802","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael McKean","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571106","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMzEwMDI4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDY3NDA0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 October 1947","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Michael John McKean","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Michael McKean was born on October 17, 1947 in New York City, New York, USA as Michael John McKean.

Gibb's early dance training lent grace to her fresh-faced beauty, qualities which won her a modeling contract with New York's Eileen Ford Agency at age 14. Within a year she was on the cover of \"Vogue\" and \"Young Miss.\" Spotted in a magazine by Woody Allen, Gibb was cast in a minor role as an autograph seeker in the filmmaker's Stardust Memories (1980) and promptly switched to an acting career. Cynthia Gibb graduated high school with honors, but with a sister at Yale and no financial aid available to her, she decided on an acting career. After appearing off-Broadway in \"Nathaniel,\" she landed the recurring part of scatterbrained Suzi Wyatt Carter of daytime television's Search for Tomorrow (1951) right after high school graduation in 1981 at the age of 19. She joined the cast of Fame (1982) and spent three seasons as drama major Holly Laird on the popular series. Between the show's first and second seasons, she starred as a hockey coach's daughter, with whom Rob Lowe fell in love, in Youngblood (1986). Between the second and third seasons, she starred in the much praised Salvador (1986), as a lay worker (based on the real life Jean Donovan) who, along with four nuns, was murdered by an El Salvador death squad. Just before filming Malone (1987), Gibb finished Modern Girls (1986), in which she played, not surprisingly, a young actress. She appeared in the television movies, \"Mary Christmas\" (2002) (TV) played Mary Maloney opposite actor John Schneider. Cynthia has also appeared in many movies including \"A Crime of Passion\" (2003) (TV), \"A Family Lost\" (2007) (TV), \"An Accidental Christmas\" (2007) (TV) and \"A Nanny For Christmas\" (2010) with Emmanuelle Vaugier, 'Dean Cain (I)' and Sarah Thompson.

His bad-guy roles included a stalker who, along with Alan Arkin terrorized a blind Audrey Hepburn in the 1967 cult classic Wait Until Dark (1967). He appeared in much lighter roles in Cactus Flower (1969), Please Don't Eat the Daisies (1960), and Dirty Dancing (1987). In the latter, he ran a family resort in the Catskills that set the stage for romance between a teen-ager and dance instructor. His stage work included the Broadway hits \"California Suite\" in 1976 and 1981's \"The Floating Lightbulb,\" for which he received a Tony nomination for his role as the trashy manager. Also in 1981, Weston appeared opposite Alan Alda in _The Four Seasons_, a movie about three middle-aged couples who vacation together. He played a cantankerous dentist obsessed with his Mercedes, which ended up going through the ice into a frozen lake at the movie's conclusion. Other film credits include Stage Struck (1958), The Cincinnati Kid (1965), The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), The Ritz (1976), and Ishtar (1987).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1OTg2MjEzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA3NjQyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0922967","name":"Jack Weston","idIMDB":"nm0922967"},"actorId":"nm0922967","character":"Oscar Baldwin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dee McCafferty","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564523","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Dee McCafferty is an actor, known for Short Circuit 2 (1988), Faux-semblants (1988) and F/X2 (1991).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564523","name":"Dee McCafferty","idIMDB":"nm0564523"},"actorId":"nm0564523","character":"Saunders","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Hemblen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0375959","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"David Hemblen was born in London, England.
