He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his sister Jean to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theater, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by William Shakespeare, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre. When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theater festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Laurence Olivier, Wendy Hiller, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Paul Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest. McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher's \"section 28\" legislation which would make the \"public promotion of homosexuality\" a crime. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand, and he has been active in the Gay Rights movement ever since. Ian resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in acclaimed stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received Richard III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Apt Pupil (1998) and Gods and Monsters (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps on 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as _King Lear (2008)_ directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and Noël Coward's \"Present Laughter\", as well as Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" and Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\", both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias. McKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in X-Men (2000) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, which he reprised in The Hobbit trilogy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjgyNjk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA3NTY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005212","name":"Ian McKellen","idIMDB":"nm0005212"},"actorId":"nm0005212","character":"Gandalf","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000143","main":true},{"actorName":"Martin Freeman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293509","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0MjAwOTMzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg1MjEyNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 September 1971","placeOfBirth":" Aldershot, Hampshire, England, UK","birthName":"Martin John Christopher Freeman","height":"5' 6½\" (1.69 m)","bio":"Martin Freeman is an English actor, best known for portraying Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy, Tim Canterbury in the original UK version of sitcom mockumentary The Office (2001), Dr. John Watson in the British crime drama Sherlock (2010) and Lester Nygaard in the dark comedy-crime drama TV series Fargo (2014).

This was in parallel to a successful film & television career that saw William building a reputation as one of the most esteemed actors in the country. In the late 90's William shifted his focus away from acting toward production and executive management. He was engaged as a producer by UK television company Cloud 9 Screen Entertainment to assist developing projects for New Zealand audiences. He was invited to head up Cloud 9's commercial division in 1999. This role saw William produce an award-winning short film, as well as a range of other corporate projects. He became a member of the Cloud 9 executive team with responsibility for managing public relations, media and communications. In 2006 the film 'Out Of The Blue' saw the welcome return of William Kircher to screen acting. The film, directed by Robert Sarkies, was based on a true story of a massacre in the small seaside village of Aramoana. 2009 - 2010 William stepped back into the production side of the business and he completed a fourteen-month contract line-producing 'The Investigator', a high rating television docudrama for Red Sky Film & Television.
