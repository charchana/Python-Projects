He, along with peers Vittorio Gassman, Ugo Tognazzi and Nino Manfredi, arguably represent the finest of post-war Italian cinema history. Born in Rome on June 15, 1920 in the Trastevere district, Sordi grew up in a musical family, his father being a tuba player for the Rome Opera House. A choir boy at the Sistine Chapel, he later trained for the theater in Milan but returned to Rome to work in radio and musical halls in comedy shows. In the late 30s he found his way into film as an extra. His first important role was in The Three Pilots (1942), a fascist war picture, but he wouldn't hit international stardom until a decade later when he starred in Federico Fellini's early films The White Sheik (1952) and I Vitelloni (1953). The titles of some of his most prolific characters were as simple as their titles: The Seducer, The Bachelor, The Husband, The Widower, The Traffic Cop, and The Moralist. Most of his protagonists amusingly, but not always pleasantly, stereotyped the worst attributes of Italian men and society, yet many of his films are unparalleled in quality and considered masterpieces. Sordi went on to star, direct and co-write more than 150 films. Never married and rather an introvert, he enjoyed a quiet, reclusive personal life. On his 80th birthday, he was made Mayor of Rome for the day. In 2002, after 190 films, he announced his retirement, and died of a heart attack the following year at age 82.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjA5ODUyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU1OTc0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814773","name":"Alberto Sordi","nicknames":["Albertone"],"idIMDB":"nm0814773"},"actorId":"nm0814773","character":"Giovanni Macchiavelli","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Monica Vitti","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0900143","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA4NDAxMTQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDUxNjc5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR14,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1931","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","birthName":"Maria Luisa Ceciarelli","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Monica Vitti was born on November 3, 1931 in Rome, Lazio, Italy as Maria Luisa Ceciarelli.

For three decades he was to be a regular of German cinema and television as well as of international English-speaking productions. However, unlike Ventura, Alberty did not become a star, remaining confined to supporting roles or even bit parts, most of the time as a German officer, although in widely seen international productions such as The Great Escape (1963), The Damned (1969) or Raid on Rommel (1971). A lookalike of Benito Mussolini (with the exception of his white-blond hair), he would have been an ideal Duce though.
