She is the daughter of homemaker Dorothea Marie (Wirth) and gas station owner James Jefferson Allen. Her mother's family was German, and her father had English, Scots-Irish, and German ancestry. She attended Rochelle Township High School where she was voted most likely to succeed. Joining Chicago's famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company ensemble in 1977, she was one of the group's original members and starred in a number of its original productions. Her first major film credits included two critically-lauded supporting performances that showcased her versatility: a comedic turn in the suburban murder mystery Compromising Positions (1985) and a dramatic role as a blind woman befriended by a serial killer in Manhunter (1986). Around the same time, Allen was making a name for herself on the New York stage; she would eventually become one of the New York theater world's most honored actresses and a winner of every major prize for her work on Broadway and off. She received a Best Actress Tony Award in 1988 for her performance, opposite John Malkovich, in Lanford Wilson's Burn This and was Tony-nominated in the same category in 1989 for the title role in The Heidi Chronicles. Continuing her work in film as well, Allen received her first Academy Award nomination for her role as Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon (1995), for which she also won awards from seven critics' associations, including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics. Allen received her second consecutive Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role in Arthur Miller's The Crucible (1996). Subsequently, her work in Ice Storm (1997), opposite Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, and in Pleasantville (1998), opposite William H. Macy and Jeff Daniels, earned her high praise and several critics' awards; she also co-starred in the action blockbuster Face/Off (1997) opposite John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. For her starring role in The Contender (2000), Allen received Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes, the Academy Awards, the SAG Awards, and the Independent Spirit Awards. Throughout the early 2000s Allen worked in both film and television, with roles in three of the Bourne films - The Bourne Supremacy (2004), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), and The Bourne Legacy (2012) - as well as The Notebook (2004), The Upside of Anger (2005), and Death Race (2008). Allen also received Emmy nominations for Les brumes d'Avalon (2001) and for the title role in the biopic Georgia O'Keeffe (2009), for which she was also executive producer. She was also recently seen in HBO's drama series Luck (2011). Allen married actor Peter Friedman in 1990, and the two divorced in 2002; Allen's daughter Sadie was born in 1994.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MjIwNTk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA2MzQxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000260","name":"Joan Allen","idIMDB":"nm0000260"},"actorId":"nm0000260","character":"Georgia O'Keeffe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0187680","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeremy Irons","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Mzg2NDY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwNzA0Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1948","placeOfBirth":" Cowes, Isle of Wight, England, UK","birthName":"Jeremy John Irons","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Elegant and handsome British actor Jeremy Irons was born in Cowes, Isle of Wight, a small island just off the south coast of England. He is the son of Barbara Anne Brereton (Sharpe) and Paul Dugan Irons, an accountant. Young Jeremy didn't prove very fond of figures. A typical islander, he used to go to mainland England only once a year. He wound up being grounded when his family settled down in Hertfordshire. At the age of 13 he enrolled in Sherborne School, Dorset, where he was happy as he could practise his favorite sport, horse-riding. Before becoming an actor, he had considered a veterinarian surgeon's career. He trained at the Bristol Old Vic School for two years, then joined Bristol Old Vic repertory company where he gained much experience working in everything from Shakespeare to contemporary dramas. He moved to London in 1971 and had a number of odd jobs before landing the role of \"John the Baptist\" in the hit musical \"Godspell\". He went on to a successful early career in the West End theatre and on TV, and debuted on-screen in Nijinsky (1980). In the early 80s, he gained international attention with his starring role in the Granada Television serial adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel Brideshead Revisited (1981), after which he was much in demand as a romantic leading man. He went on to a steady film career. In 1984, he debuted on Broadway opposite: Glenn Close in Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\" and, in the mid-80s, he appeared in three lead roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Once described as 'the thinking woman's pin up', he has made his name in thought provoking films such as David Cronenberg's Faux-semblants (1988), for which he won the New York Critics Best Actor Award. He gained a Golden Globe Award in addition to an Oscar for Best Actor in 1990 for his role as Claus von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune (1990) alongside Glenn Close. Among his many achievements, his role as Professor Higgins in Loewe-Lerner's famous musical \"My Fair Lady\" mustn't be forgotten. It was in London, back in 1987. He is married to actress Sinéad Cusack, with whom he appeared in Waterland (1992) and in the Royal Shakespeare Company plays. He appeared with his son Samuel Irons and his father-in-law Cyril Cusack in the film Roald Dahl's Danny the Champion of the World (1989). His son Max Irons is also an actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Mzg2NDY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwNzA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460","name":"Jeremy Irons","idIMDB":"nm0000460"},"actorId":"nm0000460","character":"Alfred Stieglitz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0222665","main":true},{"actorName":"Ed Begley Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000893","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1ODI0NDgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU1MDcy._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 September 1949","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Edward James Begley Jr.","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Ed Begley Jr. was born on September 16, 1949 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Edward James Begley Jr. He is an actor and producer, known for Ghostbusters (2016), St. Elsewhere (1982) and Pineapple Express (2008).
