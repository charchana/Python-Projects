Few can boast a longer one (64 years of activity). Few have been able to have to relate to three generations. And it is pretty sure that no one can compare with him in terms of faithfulness to a director: Chishu Ryu indeed appeared in no fewer than fifty-two out of fifty-four of his master Yasujirô Ozu. He played in 187 films or TV films and could be a very versatile actor: for instance in 1936, when he was thirty, he embodied a student in one film and an old man in another. However he was perfect in Ozu's films, most often, as a simple, unobtrusive man whose humanity is revealed through the hardships of everyday life. How could Japanese cinema have done without Chishu Ryu?","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5MjkzMzU4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk5MDUwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753479","name":"Chishû Ryû","idIMDB":"nm0753479"},"actorId":"nm0753479","character":"Shukichi Hirayama","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0245971","main":true},{"actorName":"Chieko Higashiyama","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0383261","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM0NjEyNjkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM0ODk5MTE@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 September 1890","placeOfBirth":" Chiba, Japan","birthName":"Sen Watanabe","bio":"Chieko Higashiyama was born on September 30, 1890 in Chiba, Japan as Sen Watanabe.

Her signature character type, variations on a daughter devoted to her parents and home, inspired the nickname that stayed with her until retirement: the Eternal Virgin. To some extent, reality mirrored her roles in these films. In a society that considers marriage and parenting almost obligatory, she remained single and childless, something of a controversy in Japan in the 1950s. Fortunately she was popular enough to avoid criticism, but the 1950s were still a hard decade. She was plagued by ill health, missing out on several top roles as a result, and she witnessed the death of her camera-man brother in a freak train accident on set. In 1963, shortly after the death of her mentor, director Yasujirô Ozu, she suddenly walked away from the film industry. At age 43, and at the height of her popularity, she bluntly refused to perform again, angering her fans, the industry, and the press. She implied acting had never been a pleasure and that she had only pursued a career in order to provide for her large family; this explanation is seen as the cause of her popularity backlash. She moved to a small house in picturesque Kamakura where she remained, living alone (though apparently sociable with friends), and refusing all roles offered. She is undoubtedly known mostly for her work with Yasujiro Ozu, making six films with the great director, including the so-called Noriko trilogy, of which Tokyo Story (1953) is probably the best-known. She also worked with Akira Kurosawa, Mikio Naruse, Hiroshi Inagaki, and many others.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNjcyNjc2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU2ODMwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0361697","name":"Setsuko Hara","nicknames":["The Eternal Virgin"],"idIMDB":"nm0361697"},"actorId":"nm0361697","character":"Noriko Hirayama","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Haruko Sugimura","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0837503","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 January 1909","placeOfBirth":" Hiroshima, Japan","bio":"Haruko Sugimura was born on January 6, 1909 in Hiroshima, Japan.
