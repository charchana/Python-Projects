Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"Pascal Ichak","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0489713","main":true},{"actorName":"Micheline Presle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0696163","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NzUwNjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MjI5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 August 1922","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Micheline Nicole Julia Emilienne Chassagne","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Dark-haired, Paris-born Micheline Presle (better known in the States as Micheline Prelle) was the daughter of a businessman and took acting classes as a teen.

She proceeded to make films during the Occupation, and by 1947, was deemed an important young French star, with Devil in the Flesh (1947) (Devil in the Flesh) gaining her world-wide attention. Her marriage to American actor-turned-producer William Marshall in 1950 led her to attempt Hollywood pictures. None of her pictures, which included Under My Skin (1950), American Guerrilla in the Philippines (1950) and Adventures of Captain Fabian (1951), the last one produced and directed by husband Marshall, endeared her to American audiences; however, despite co-starring opposite top Hollywood stars John Garfield, Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn. Divorced by 1954, she never adjusted to the Hollywood way of life and returned willingly to Paris with her daughter, actress/director Tonie Marshall. She continued to reign supreme in French films and has appeared frequently on the stage as well. Some of her post-Hollywood films include House of Ricordi (1954) (House of Ricordi), Royal Affairs in Versailles (1954) (Royal Affairs in Versailles), Her Bridal Night (1956) (The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful), Demoniqque (1958), King of Hearts (1966) (King of Hearts), Donkey Skin (1970) (The Magic Donkey), Le journal du séducteur (1996) (Diary of a Seducer) and Les misérables (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NzUwNjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MjI5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0696163","name":"Micheline Presle","idIMDB":"nm0696163"},"actorId":"nm0696163","character":"Marcelle Ichak","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nino Kirtadze","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457038","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1968","placeOfBirth":" Tbilisi, USSR [now Republic of Georgia]","bio":"Academy-award-winning director Nino Kirtadze is internationally renowned for her sensitive and compassionate approach to difficult issues and her intense visual sense.
