Her father was of Russian Jewish descent and her mother was of Austrian Jewish ancestry. She is the sister of Carrie Ann Morrow and half-sister of actress Mina Badie. Jennifer's parents divorced when she was two. Jennifer worked in her first film at the age of nine, in a nonspeaking role for the film Death of a Stranger (The Spy Who Never Was (1976)). At 14 she attended summer acting workshops given by Lee Strasberg and landed a role in the Disney TV movie Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color: The Young Runaways (1978), and received her Screen Actors Guild membership in an episode of the TV series Baretta (1975) when she was 16. Jennifer performed in several TV movies and dropped out of Pacific Palisades High School six weeks short of graduation for her major role in the film Eyes of a Stranger (1981). Her first major success came as the female lead in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). Jennifer was married to writer/director Noah Baumbach from 2005 to 2013, and the two have a son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MzU2NTg0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjcyNjY0MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000492","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh","nicknames":["JJL"],"idIMDB":"nm0000492"},"actorId":"nm0000492","character":"Lisa Hesselman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0565879","main":true},{"actorName":"Tom Noonan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006888","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjk5NTM2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY4MzQzMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1951","placeOfBirth":" Greenwich, Connecticut, USA","height":"6' 6\" (1.98 m)","bio":"Offbeat character actor Tom Noonan started off his career in various theater troupes that utilized his skills as a guitarist and composer. A graduate from Yale's acting school, he founded the Paradise Theatre in 1983, which was instrumental later in his growth as an artist. Gravitating toward film and TV in the 80s, he began appearing regularly in edgy, unsympathetic roles, most notably as the \"Tooth Fairy\" serial killer in Manhunter (1986) which was the first feature length film to introduce the infamous Hannibal Lector character. Most of his other work at this time was solid but unrewarding, including such looming parts in Easy Money (1983), Best Defense (1984), The Monster Squad (1987) and RoboCop 2 (1990), so he began to take classes in writing and directing in order to extend himself. In the mid-90s, by appearing in a number of mainstream parts, he was able to finance his own first play-turned-art house film project What Happened Was... (1994), which became the darling of the Sundance Film Festival that year and won the Grand Jury Prize, not to mention an Independent Spirit nomination. He filmed it in eleven days at a cost of $300,000, and managed to edit it only hours before the Sundance deadline. The success of the two character film, which starred Tom and Karen Sillas as an awkward couple on their first date, induced Tom to finance another film, The Wife (1995), based on his Obie-winning (for writing) play \"Wifey\", which co-starred Tom with Julie Hagerty, Wallace Shawn and his one-time wife Karen Young. This film, which was warmly received at the Sundance Festival as well, was barely released theatrically, however, as was his third hands-on feature Wang Dang (1999). Notable 90s TV work included roles in The X-Files (1993) and the miniseries Heaven & Hell: North & South, Book III (1994), in which he also composed the score. The New York-based actor continues to perform as well as teach acting at the Paradise Theatre, where many of his plays-turned-films got off the ground. He has also written short works of fiction.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjk5NTM2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY4MzQzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006888","name":"Tom
