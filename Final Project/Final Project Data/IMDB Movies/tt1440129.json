Taylor Kitsch was born on April 8, 1981 in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, to Susan (Green), who worked for the BC Liquor Board, and Drew Kitsch, who worked in construction. He grew up in Vancouver. During his childhood, he aspired to become an actor, which eventually was the real reason behind his move to New York. There, Taylor pursued his dreams by studying the art of acting with coach Sheila Grey. Not too long after that, Taylor was cast in several film and television roles, such as John Tucker Must Die (2006), Des serpents dans l'avion (2006) and Kyle XY (2006). Moving to New York in 2002 was the prize that Taylor received after being scouted by modeling scouts in Canada. Taylor was signed to \"IMG Models\" and became a regular face for the famous clothing lines, \"Abercrombie & Fitch\" and also \"Diesel\". Taylor was also signed under \"Untitled Entertainment\" during his two years stay in the city. While Taylor was living in New York, he found time to become a certified personal trainer and nutritionist. In the year 2004, Taylor decided that it was time for him to move to Los Angeles to learn more about the acting course. Taylor stayed in Los Angeles for about eight months and did some print work with \"Nous Modeling Management\". It wasn't too long until Taylor realized that he didn't want to be in Los Angeles. Taylor thought that things were running a little bit too fast for him, then making the decision to move back to Vancouver for the summer of 2005 to spend more time with his family. In 2006, Taylor then signed with \"Endeavour\". What shot him to bigger fame was his role in the movie, The Covenant (2006), with actors Steven Strait, Toby Hemingway and Chace Crawford. In the stylish thriller from Lakeshore Entertainment and Sony Screen Gems, four young witches do battle with a powerful, centuries-old supernatural force. In \"The Covenant\", fans got to know who Taylor really is. Even though the movie wasn't as successful as people hoped it would be, Taylor became more recognized since acting in the movie. In the movie, fans also got to see a more fit and toned version of Taylor. Fortunately, after \"The Covenant\", casting directors from the football teen drama, Friday Night Lights (2006), saw the talent that Taylor had. They eventually hired Taylor to play the role of \"Tim Riggins\", one of the Dillon Panthers' main players. On \"Friday Night Lights\", Taylor managed to show his acting skills to fans and television critics who were very impressed with Taylor's acting skills. USA Today called the series \"one of the best-acted, best-written, best-produced shows on television\". After receiving fame and gaining a big fan base from \"Friday Night Lights\", Taylor received the acting publicity he had always been waiting for. During the show's summer hiatus, Taylor filmed the feature Gospel Hill (2008), alongside Julia Stiles, Danny Glover, Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Giancarlo Esposito, the film focuses on the bigoted former sheriff of a southern town and a one-time civil rights worker whose intersecting lives are still haunted by events that took place decades earlier. Old wounds are reopened as residents of a black neighborhood are forced out of their homes to make way for a multi-million dollar development. In February 2008, he signed on to play \"Gambit\" in the \"X-Men\" franchise spin-off, X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). He subsequently starred in the films The Bang Bang Club (2010), John Carter (2012), Battleship (2012), and Savages (2012). Despite being famous, Taylor is still a very humble guy and has said that he'd prefer to skip the whole tabloid craze. During his free time, he enjoys doing charity work and listening to music, especially those in the country genre. With all the success and a humble attitude, we're pretty sure that Taylor is going to be one of the \"Must Watch\" stars for the coming years. When he's not on set, Kitsch pursues children's charity work and enjoys spending time with family and friends.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNTI3MjcyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYwMjAyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2018237","name":"Taylor Kitsch","idIMDB":"nm2018237"},"actorId":"nm2018237","character":"Lieutenant Alex Hopper","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0303909","main":true},{"actorName":"Alexander Skarsgård","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002907","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTgxNTk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM5Mjc1OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 August 1976","placeOfBirth":" Stockholm, Stockholms län, Sweden","birthName":"Alexander Johan Hjalmar Skarsgård","height":"6' 4½\" (1.94 m)","bio":"Alexander Johan Hjalmar Skarsgård was born in Stockholm, Sweden and is the eldest son of famed actor Stellan Skarsgård. Among his siblings are actors Gustaf Skarsgård, Bill Skarsgård, and Valter Skarsgård. For most of his formative years, his father was an acclaimed actor in Europe but had not yet achieved the international fame that came after his star turn in Breaking the Waves (1996). Young Alexander was raised under modest circumstances in a working-class Swedish neighborhood as his parents wanted their children to have as normal an upbringing as possible. He began his acting career at the age of eight and continued working in films and on Swedish television until he turned sixteen and decided acting was not the career for him. Life under a microscope lost its charm and perhaps due to the influence of My Skarsgård, his physician mother, he stopped working as an actor, to continue his education. Instead of continuing college, at the age of nineteen, he entered compulsory military service (military conscription). He used the time to contemplate his future. He studied at the Leeds Metropolitan University then moved to New York where he enrolled at Marymount Manhattan College to study theatre. After six months in New York, a romantic entanglement lured him back to Sweden but the relationship was short-lived. Despite having a broken heart, Alexander decided to stay in Sweden and, with a bit of life experience under his belt, began his acting career again. He appeared in a number of Swedish productions and became a star in his native country but was interested in broadening his horizons and working outside of Sweden. A visit to Los Angeles landed him both an agent and a part in the Ben Stiller movie, Zoolander (2001). After that Alexander returned to Sweden where he continued honing his acting in film and theatrical productions including \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" and \"Bloody Wedding\". He also co-wrote and co-directed an award-winning short, Att döda ett barn (2003), (To Kill a Child), which was shown at both the Tribeca and Cannes Film Festivals. His first big break was with the miniseries Generation Kill (2008). Alexander spent seven months broiling in the desert of Namibia but it was well worth it. His portrayal of Marine Sgt. Brad \"Iceman\" Colbert astonished critics and audiences, alike. Thanks to the writer's strike, after completing Generation Kill (2008), he was cast in the role of \"Eric Northman\", a 1,000-year-old Viking vampire on the hit series, True Blood (2008). The series was created by Alan Ball, the man behind Six Feet Under (2001). True Blood (2008) was adapted from the \"Sookie Stackhouse' novels by Charlaine Harris' and rode to success on quality scripts, great acting and the public's obsession with the vampire genre. In addition to True Blood (2008), which begins its third season in 2010, Alexander has a number of film projects in the works including the remake of Straw Dogs (2011), Melancholia (2011), written and directed by Lars von Trier, action Sci-Fi film, Battleship (2012), and The East (2013), directed by Zal Batmanglij.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTgxNTk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM5Mjc1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002907","name":"Alexander Skarsgård","nicknames":["Alex"],"idIMDB":"nm0002907"},"actorId":"nm0002907","character":"Commander Stone Hopper","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0304398","main":true},{"actorName":"Rihanna","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1982597","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNTI5ODg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ3MDA0Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 February 1988","placeOfBirth":" St. Michael, Barbados","birthName":"Robyn Rihanna Fenty","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born in a parish in Barbados called St. Michael, to Monica (Braithwaite), an accountant, and Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor.

His first critical success in the West was in Hirokazu Koreeda's Maborosi (1995), in which he played a man who inexplicably throws himself in front of a train, widowing his wife and orphaning his infant son.

He has directed commercial TV spots for Chara. Hesistant to identify himself as an actor, he most readily describes himself as a vocalist, referring to Mach 1.67, the band he has with director Gakuryû Ishii.

Antrim, Northern Ireland, UK","birthName":"William John Neeson","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Liam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, UK, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, truck driver, assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role. Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including The Bounty (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984), The Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1993), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindler's List (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor. Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005). Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Taken (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Clash of the Titans (2010) and The A-Team (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown (2011), The Grey (2011), Battleship (2012) and Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel La colère des Titans (2012). Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MTQ3NzU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE3Mjg0MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553","name":"Liam Neeson","idIMDB":"nm0000553"},"actorId":"nm0000553","character":"Admiral Shane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0223656","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter MacNicol","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001493","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI1MzMzMTA0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ1ODE0NjE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 April 1954","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Peter MacNicol was born on April 10, 1954 in Dallas, Texas, USA.
