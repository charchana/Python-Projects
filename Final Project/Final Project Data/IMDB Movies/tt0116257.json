His father was of Irish and German descent, and his mother was of French-Canadian, English, and German ancestry. When he was six years old, his parents divorced. A year later, his mother married Eugene Addis, a Miami Beach police officer, and moved to Miami Shores, Florida. After graduating from Horace Mann Junior High School, Rourke's family moved to a house located on 47th Street and Prairie Avenue in Miami Beach. In 1969 Rourke attended Miami Beach Senior High School, where he played second-string first baseman under coach Skip Berkman. He also acted in a school play, \"The Serpent,\" directed by legendary \"Teacher To The Stars\" Jay W. Jensen. In 1971 he graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School, and after working for a short time as a bus boy at the famed Forge Restaurant on Miami Beach, Rourke moved back to New York to seek out a career in acting. Rourke's teenage years were more aimed toward sports more than acting. He took up self-defense training at the Boys Club of Miami. It was there he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career. At the age of 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as an 118-pound bantamweight, defeating Javier Villanueva. Some of his early matches were fought as Andre Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed 5th Street Gym in Miami Beach,soon joining the Police Athletic League boxing program. In 1969 Rourke, now weighing 140 pounds, sparred with former World Welterweight champion Luis Rodriguez. Rodriguez was the number one-rated middleweight boxer in the world and was training for his match with world champion Nino Benvenuti. Rourke claims to have received a concussion in this sparring match. In 1971, at the Florida Golden Gloves, Rourke received another concussion from a boxing match. Doctors told him to take a year off and rest. In 1972 Rourke knocked out Ron Robinson in 18 seconds and John Carver in 39 seconds. On Aug. 20, 1973, Rourke knocked out 'Sherman \"Big Train\"' Bergman' in 31 seconds. Shortly after, Rourke decided to retire from amateur boxing. From 1964 to 1973, Rourke compiled an amateur boxing record of 27 wins (17 by knockout) and 3 defeats. At one point, he reportedly scored 12 consecutive first-round knockouts. As an amateur, Rourke had been friendly with pro-boxer Tommy Torino. When Rourke decided to return to boxing as a professional in 1991, Torino promoted some of Rourke's fights. Rourke was trained by former pro-boxer Freddie Roach at Miami Beach's 5th Street Gym and the Outlaw Boxing Club Gym in Los Angeles. He made $250 for his pro debut, but by the end of his second year of boxing, he had earned a million dollars. In June 1994, Rourke appeared on the cover of World Boxing Magazine. He sparred with world champions James Toney, John David Jackson, and Tommy Morrison. Rourke wished to have 16 professional fights and then fight for a world title. However, he retired in 1994 after eight bouts and never got his desired title fight. His boxing career resulted in severe facial injuries that required a number of operations to repair his damaged face. Rourke went back to acting but worked in relative obscurity until he won a Golden Globe Award for his role as Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson in The Wrestler (2008). He was nominated for Best Actor, as well, but lost.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MzYwNDA2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYzMjg4Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000620","name":"Mickey Rourke","idIMDB":"nm0000620"},"actorId":"nm0000620","character":"Ed Altman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0076118","main":true},{"actorName":"Annabel Schofield","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0774509","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1963","placeOfBirth":" Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales, UK","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Annabel Schofield was born on September 4, 1963 in Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales.

His parents are Mercedes Hall, an actress-blues and jazz singer, and Larry Hall, who owned an auto body shop. His stepfather is a show-business manager. His sister, Mary Christian, is also a performer. He has Irish and Italian ancestry. Hall's given name was Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall, but he adopted the Anthony Michael moniker upon finding that another Michael Hall was already a member of the Screen Actors' Guild. Hall began acting in commercials at the age of seven, and his breakthrough role was as Rusty Griswold in National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) alongside Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Following the success of National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Hall entered the defining period of his career, starring in three John Hughes classics: Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985) and Weird Science (1985). Wanting to avoid being typecast, Hall turned down roles in two subsequent 1986 Hughes films, Pretty in Pink (1986) and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). His early television credits include the Emmy Award-winning \"The Gold Bug\", in which he played the young Edgar Allan Poe, as well as the TV movie Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (1982), and specials \"The Body Human\" and \"Orphans, Waifs and Wards\". On stage, he appeared in the Lincoln Center Festival's production of \"St. Joan of the Microphone\". Following a one-year stint on Saturday Night Live (1975), excessive drinking and partying threatened to sidetrack Hall's career. However, he was able to regain control and has been sober since 1990, the year he played the role of Jim in Edward Scissorhands (1990). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, he starred as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in the television movie Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999). Since that time, Hall has focused on television work, including an 81-episode run on Stephen King's The Dead Zone (2002), but has managed to take on film projects as well, including the role of Mike Engel in The Dark Knight (2008). In addition to acting, Hall has also pursued his musical talents, as songwriter and lead singer of his band, Hall of Mirrors, which was formed in 1998. Hall helps at-risk youth via the Anthony Michael Hall Literacy Club and lives in Los Angeles, Caifornia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MjM2MjAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2NjQwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309","name":"Anthony Michael Hall","idIMDB":"nm0001309"},"actorId":"nm0001309","character":"Nick","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hank Garrett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0308056","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MTYyNDk4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcyNjczNw@@._V1._CR524,1073.8999938964844,421,0_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 October 1931","placeOfBirth":" Monticello, New York, USA","bio":"Hank Garrett was born on October 26, 1931 in Monticello, New York, USA.
