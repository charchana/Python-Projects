He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break. His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Summer Bay (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga. Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000). What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster's Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005), for which he was nominated for an Oscar and a B.A.F.T.A. Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. After his death he received more than thirty posthumous awards for his portrayal as the psychopathic clown prince of crime in The Dark Knight (2008) (including the Oscar, S.A.G., B.A.F.T.A., and Golden Globe)","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2NTY0NzA4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE1MDE0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005132","name":"Heath Ledger","nicknames":["Heathy"],"idIMDB":"nm0005132"},"actorId":"nm0005132","character":"William Thatcher","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010462","main":true},{"actorName":"Rufus Sewell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001722","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDI2MzIwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIyNTY0Mg@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 October 1967","placeOfBirth":" Twickenham, Middlesex, England, UK","birthName":"Rufus Frederick Sewell","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Rufus Sewell was born on the 29th of October 1967 in Twickenham, England.

At the age of one, Shannyn and her family moved to a new locale: Reno, Nevada. Her youth was spent at a dance studio. In 1995, she left her hometown the day after graduating from Galena High School, for Los Angeles, to pursue dance. She started deejaying as a hobby with her then boyfriend in the local clubs around town. Paying her bills every month were her appearances in commercials. Acting was not high on the young dancer's priority list, aside from a series of commercials, not for lack of interest but for the fact that she was content with her life in L.A. as it was. It was in 1999, when Shannyn was helping a friend D.J. at a birthday party for Gwyneth Paltrow that a new chapter began in her fairy tale life. Francine Maisler, a casting director known for such films as The Usual Suspects (1995), spotted Shannyn. Shortly thereafter Shannyn found herself with the backing of an influential Hollywood name and one very important audition... A Knight's Tale (2001). She determined she wanted the lead role and after six call backs, beat out the competition to play \"Lady Jocelyn\". Admittedly, the dancer turned actress knew little of her Australian costar Heath Ledger but the two became friends during filming. Since then, she appeared in the independent features Road to Nowhere (2010), directed by Monte Hellman and Man Without a Head for director Johnny Roc, as well as in Wristcutters: A Love Story (2006), with Patrick Fugit and Tom Waits, 40 Days and 40 Nights (2002) opposite Josh Hartnett, and The Rules of Attraction (2002) for director Roger Avary.

Her father, Alister, used to run a small building company but is now an aspiring scriptwriter; her mother, Rose, used to be a nurse but is now a college lecturer. She has an older brother who works with computers, a younger sister who is studying philosophy at university, and a younger brother who hasn't yet decided what he wants to do. Laura describes her family as a pretty close bunch. Alister Fraser was instrumental in getting his daughter into acting when she was at school. He wrote a play for the youth club in which she played the female lead. After completing High School, Laura did a drama foundation course at Glasgow's Langside College, and than went to the prestigious Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. During her time there, she got a supporting role in Gillies MacKinnon's film Small Faces (1996). This was on top of a couple of other minor roles she had taken (such as 'Big Day for the Bad Guys). The college authorities took a pretty dim view of the amount of professional work she had been taking on, questioning her commitment to the course. Having not been enjoying her time at the Academy, and encouraged by her parents, she dropped out after a year and moved to London. She landed the starring female role in the BBC adaptation of Neil Gaiman's _\"NeverWhere\" (1996) (mini)_ series, and then moved to several small or supporting roles in films (Cousin Bette, Man in the Iron Mask), as well as a lead in the short film 'Paris Brixton'. She also appeared as a minor character in single TV dramas, such as 'The Investigator' and 'The Tribe'). Her role in the movie Left Luggage (1998) was more substantial and led to her getting one of the main character roles in the black comedy Divorcing Jack (1998) (at least in the first half). And her highest profile performance as the lead female in the comedy Virtual Sexuality (1999) in 1998. From here she has appeared in a number of films, mainly in supporting roles, but always noticeable. Her performance as Lavinia in the offbeat version of Titus (1999) has particularly been singled out for praise. All these roles have demonstrated her versatility in characterization and style to the full. From the fantasy of 'Neverwhere', comedy of 'Virtual Sexuality', Shakespearean drama of 'Titus', emotional drama of 'Forgive and Forget' and slapstick of 'Kevin and Perry', Laura cannot be typecast. She effortlessly adapts to all the genres (and accents where needed; she has rarely appeared acting using her own Glasgow accent). Laura moved to America after completing Coney Island Baby (2003). She landed a role in the well regarded HBO drama Iron Jawed Angels (2004), and also met up with Karl Geary, her co-star in 'Coney Island Baby'. They lived together in Brooklyn, and subsequently married in New York in 2003. They moved to Ireland in mid 2004. In early 2005, Laura returned to live in Glasgow with her husband and stepdaughter, and a desire to start a family and focus on local work. She found she was pregnant in late 2005, and spent time working as a choreographer on a pantomime written by her father 'Oh Yes He Is!' for the charity Sense Scotland. In May 2006 she and Karl became proud parents of a baby girl. Laura intended to not work for 12 months and be a full-time mum, but by September 2006 she was back making a film for the BBC.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMjc0MzgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY5NjQ2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0292182","name":"Laura Fraser","idIMDB":"nm0292182"},"actorId":"nm0292182","character":"Kate","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mark Addy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004692","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkyMzUyNDYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODc3Nzk1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 January 1964","placeOfBirth":" York, England, UK","birthName":"Mark Addy Johnson","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Mark Addy was born on January 14, 1964 in York, England as Mark Addy Johnson.

During this time, Alan was also an active member of the Delta Psi Omega fraternity. After leaving LMJC, Alan went on to study at the prestigious Juilliard conservatory but left in 1996 before earning a degree. After a number of smaller stage productions and a small role in the movie Patch Adams (1998), Alan landed his first Broadway role in 1999 with \"Epic Proportions.\" He quickly became a sought-after comedic actor, with roles in such films as 28 Days (2000) and A Knight's Tale (2001). In 2002, Alan got the role of Wash, the wise-cracking pilot of Serenity on the short-lived series Firefly (2002).

No other networks would buy the failed series, but Universal Pictures began courting creator Joss Whedon to produce a big-screen version of the series.

After leaving school at the age of sixteen, he took a succession of different jobs, including working on a pig farm and as a porter at Yeovil District Hospital, before travelling and working extensively throughout Europe. At eighteen, James returned to college to take his A-Levels, one of which was Drama. It was there that he realised that this was something he felt inspired by and so applied for and was accepted onto the acting course at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Whilst playing the title role in \"Henry V\" in the first term of his final year at Central, he was seen by a casting director from the RSC and invited to join the company, immediately, in Stratford. Although initially asked only to play \"Ferdinand\" in Nicholas Hytner's production of \"The Tempest\", he left the RSC two years later having performed in eight productions and been directed by the likes of Adrian Noble, Roger Michell and Gene Saks playing, amongst other, \"Edgar\" in \"King Lear\" and \"Malcolm\" in \"Macbeth\". Over the next six years, he divided his time between theatre and television. In the theatre, he worked with Katie Mitchell on \"Women of Troy\" at the Gate; Matthew Warchus, Ken Stott and Jude Law on \"Death of a Salesman\" at the West Yorkshire Playhouse; Iain Glen on \"Hamlet\" at Bristol Old Vic; Bill Alexander in a critically-acclaimed season at Birmingham Rep, playing leading parts in \"The Servant\", \"The Way of the World\" and \"Macbeth\"; and with Simon Callow, Joseph Fiennes, Rupert Graves, and Helen McCrory, on \"Les Enfants du Paradis\", again for the RSC. As well as appearing in the BBC's landmark period drama, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1996), he has always chosen to do a wide variety of parts on television, to avoid being typecast. From the psychopathic rapist in BBC1's Calling the Shots (1993) with Lynn Redgrave to the fraudster \"Darius Guppy\" in LWT's \"The Prince\"; from the urbane observer \"Nick Jenkins\" in Channel 4's A Dance to the Music of Time (1997) to the sad stalker in Granada's series, Metropolis (2000), James has always managed to confound people's expectations of him. Over the last few years, he has been busy making feature films, on average at the rate of three a year. Early credits include \"Jedd Wainwright\" in Feast of July (1995) for \"Merchant Ivory\", and as the bisexual Irish baker, \"Brendan\" in Rose Troche's Bedrooms and Hallways (1998). From the alcoholic roustabout \"Tom Bertram\" in Mansfield Park (1999) to the wannabee \"Bond\" actor \"Carl Phipps\" in Maybe Baby (2000); the gambling, womanising \"Daniel\" in Women Talking Dirty (1999) with Helena Bonham Carter to the noble, enigmatic \"Prince Edward\" in Brian Helgeland's A Knight's Tale (2001). He has continued to surprise those who seek to pidgeon-hole him in his film career - always choosing to play parts that juxtapose strongly with the one he has just completed. Last year, he returned to the theatre to play the rake \"Ned Loveless\" in Trevor Nunn's acclaimed production of \"The Relapse\" at the National Theatre in London, before embarking on the biggest challenge he has yet faced - playing \"George\" in the big budget George and the Dragon (2004), with, among others, Michael Clarke Duncan, Val Kilmer, Piper Perabo and Patrick Swayze.

The other two, twins, are Ian Brimble and Vincent Brimble. Their father, Roy Brimble, was a school teacher, which freed him in summers to travel around with and sometimes manage groups of performers. He acted with WEA and Bristol Arts Society and the sons grew up taking him through his lines and going to see him in plays. When Roy did TV and radio from Bristol, the three children played parts in productions such as 'Children Of The New Forest'. Nick applied to the Italia Conti stage school when he was about ten, but wasn't allowed to go. Instead, he passed his scholarship to Bristol Grammar school, and his reward was a season ticket to Bristol Old Vic Theatre where he saw every show until he went to University in '62. Nick graduated with a 2.1 degree (read \"two-one\" or Second Class Honours, Upper Division), which roughly equates to the American high 'B' range (3.0 - 3.3) as the minimum standard for entry into graduate school in England and Wales. He taught for a while after graduation. When he began acting, it was with a group of mostly young actors who learned and evaluated each other as they performed. Nick's strong features enable him to adopt a forbidding appearance in so many of his tough-guy roles. However, he's an utterly charming, somewhat reserved gentleman with a wonderful smile and electrifying blue eyes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNDgwMDI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxNTMzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003818","name":"Nick
