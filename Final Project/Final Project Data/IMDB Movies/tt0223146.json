It didn't take him long to become one of France's first major comic film stars, and he soon became internationally famous. Unfortunately, his popularity started to wane by 1915, and his screen appearances became less frequent; he made his last film in 1928. Sadly, he died ten years later, broke and forgotten by the industry that he helped to launch.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDcwZWZlZDEtOTVlZC00NGI0LWFhYTAtM2YwZjJkYTAwMzM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0214243","name":"André Deed","idIMDB":"nm0214243"},"actorId":"nm0214243","character":"Pierrot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0223146","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223146","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 min"],"soundMix":["Silent"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":["39.62 m"],"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.6","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"236","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0015284","name":"Star-Film"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["clown","trick film","trick photography","seemingly beheaded","detachable leg","dislocated arm","grotto","dismemberment"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 02:50:07"}}
