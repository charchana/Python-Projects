Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"François Pignon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0021232","main":true},{"actorName":"Gérard Depardieu","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDU4OTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwODY0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 December 1948","placeOfBirth":" Châteauroux, Indre, France","birthName":"Gérard Xavier Marcel Depardieu","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Gérard Depardieu was born in Châteauroux, Indre, France, to Anne Jeanne Josèphe (Marillier) and René Maxime Lionel Depardieu, who was a metal worker and fireman. Young delinquent and wanderer in the past, Depardieu started his acting career at the small traveling theatre \"Cafe de la Gare\", along with Patrick Dewaere and Miou-Miou. After minor roles in cinema, at last, he got his chance in Bertrand Blier's Going Places (1974). That film established a new type of hero in the French cinema and the actor's popularity grew enormously. Later, he diversified his screen image and became the leading French actor of the 80s and 90s. He was twice awarded a César as Best Actor for Le dernier métro (1980) and Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), also received an Oscar nomination for \"Cyrano\" and a number of awards at international film festivals. In 1996, he was distinguished by the highest French title of \"Chevalier du Légion d'Honneur\". He married Elisabeth Depardieu in 1971, and they divorced in 1996; she appeared with him in Jean de Florette (1986) and Manon of the Spring (1986); their children Guillaume Depardieu and Julie Depardieu are both actors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDU4OTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTUwODY0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000367","name":"Gérard Depardieu","idIMDB":"nm0000367"},"actorId":"nm0000367","character":"Jean Lucas","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0021233","main":true},{"actorName":"Anny Duperey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0243175","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIxZDgzNjItNGFiMC00M2FhLWI0YjYtOGJiMGE3M2M0NWU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA2NDgyNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 June 1947","placeOfBirth":" Rouen, France","birthName":"Annie Legras","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Anny Duperey was born on June 28, 1947 in Rouen, France as Annie Legras.
