Born Angiolino Joseph Pascal Ventura to Giovanni Ventura and Luisa Borrini, on July 14, 1919, in Parma (northern) Italy, young Lino moved with his family at a young age to Paris, where he grew up. A school dropout at age eight, Lino drifted from job to job (mechanic's apprentice, etc.), unable to decide on what to do for a living. Marrying in 1942 at age 23, he and wife Odette had four children. Lino finally found a career calling as a Greek/Roman-styled wrestler and went on to become a professional European champion in 1950. He was forced to abandon this sporting life, however, after incurring a serious injury in the ring. Looking for gangster types for his next film, director Jacques Becker gave the inexperienced 34-year-old his first acting job as bad guy support to star Jean Gabin in the crime thriller Touchez Pas au Grisbi (1954) [Grisbi]. Gabin was impressed and did more than just encourage Lino to pursue acting as a living. Lino went on to appear with Gabin in several of the star's subsequent movies, often playing a gangster, including Razzia (1955) [Razzia], Crime and Punishment (1956), Le rouge est mis (1957) [Crime and Punishment] and Inspector Maigret (1958) [Inspector Maigret]. A tough, brutish, burly-framed presence, Lino came into his own as a tough-nut character star in the 1960s playing both sides of the moral fence. Adept in both light comedy and dark-edged drama, he appeared in scores of films now considered classic French cinema. His homely, craggy-looking mug took the form of various criminals types as in Le Deuxieme Souffle (1966) [Second Breath] and Happy New Year (1973) [Happy New Year], as well as dogged, good-guy inspectors in The French Detective (1975) [The French Detective], Cadavres exquis (1976) [Illustrious Corpses'], and Garde à vue (1981). Lino bore a patented weight-of-the-world-on-his-shoulders countenance that audiences sympathized with, even when playing the arch-villain. Over the course of three decades he built up an impressive gallery of blue-collar protagonists. Not to be missed are his embittered, vengeful husband in Un témoin dans la ville (1959) [Witness in the City]; corrupt police chief Tiger Brown in Three Penny Opera (1963) [The Threepenny Opera]; a WWII French Resistance fighter in Army of Shadows (1969) [Army in the Shadows]; and Mafia boss Vito Genovese in Charles Bronson's Cosa Nostra (1972), among many, many others. Toward the end of his career he played Jean Valjean in a French production of Les misérables (1982) for which he received a Cesar award nomination (i.e, the French \"Oscar\"). He performed practically until the time of his fatal heart attack in 1987 at age 68 in his beloved France. Survivors included his wife of 45 years and children. Daughter Mylene died in a plane crash in 1998 and wife Odette died in 2013.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NTQzODYxNzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQ3ODMyNTUx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893341","name":"Lino Ventura","idIMDB":"nm0893341"},"actorId":"nm0893341","character":"Le commissaire Verjeat","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Dewaere","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223033","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwOTM1MDQzMzheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU1NDkyMDkx._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 January 1947","placeOfBirth":" Saint Brieuc, Côtes-du-Nord, France","birthName":"Jean-Marie Patrick Bourdeaux","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Popular but troubled renegade French actor Patrick Dewaere was christened Jean-Marie Patrick Bourdeaux on January 26, 1947, at Saint-Brieuc in Britanny in the north-west region of France. The third of six children born to actress Mado Maurin (1915-2011), his mothere made acting a family affair. All of his siblings -- Jean-Pierre Maurin (1941-1996), Yves-Marie Maurin (1944-2009), Dominique Maurin (1949- ), 'Jean-Francois Maurin' (1957- ) and 'Marie-Veronique Maurin' (1960- ) -- all became thespians. Patrick made his film debut at the age of four under the name Patrick Maurin in Amazing Monsieur Fabre (1951). While growing up, he was taunted by his schoolyard friends for his young film endeavors, he learned sensitivity and isolation at an early age. Other films during this adolescent period of time included his playing an unbilled child role in Gene Kelly's La route joyeuse (1957). As a young adult in the early 1960s Patrick appeared on French television, then joined the \"Café de Gare\" theatrical troupe in 1968 where he remained for nearly a decade. It was during these stage years that he changed his stage name to Dewaere, the maiden name of his great grandmother. He also met and became romantically involvement with fellow troupe member Miou-Miou. A child, Angele, was born to this liaison in 1974, but the couple broke up after only two years. Another daughter, Lola, was born in the early 1980s from a later marriage. After numerous film bits, stardom was finally his with the leading rebel-like role of Pierrot in Bertrand Blier's anarchic comedy Going Places (1974) [Going Places], which also starred up-and-coming actor Gérard Depardieu and lady love Miou-Miou. He and Depardieu earned instant \"anti-hero\" stardom in this tale of two wanderlust petty thugs. Patrick's genius for dark, offbeat comedy was apparent in the number of black comedies that came his way. Catherine & Co. (1975) [Catherine & Co.] co-starred Patrick with Jane Birkin, a social commentary on the prostitution business. He followed this with the crime drama The French Detective (1975) [The French Detective] as Lino Ventura's inspector sidekick. Dewaere earned high marks for his off-balanced role in La meilleure façon de marcher (1976) [The Best Way], then paired up again with Depardieu in the Oscar-winning cross-over comedy Get Out Your Handkerchiefs (1978) [Get Out Your Handkerchiefs]. Infinitely more interested in searching out complex roles than fame, his work in films were more often than not experimental, lowbudget and quirky in style. He appeared innately drawn to playing sensitive, scruffy, miserable neurotics, misfits and losers, as exemplified by his characters in Coup de tete (1979)_ [Hothead], Série noire (1979), Heat of Desire (1981) [Heat of Desire], Hôtel des Amériques (1981) [Hotel America] which co-starred Catherine Deneuve, and the critically-acclaimed Beau Pere (1981). This obsesssion may have triggered a deep and profound suffering in his own off-screen personal life. Unlike his counterpart Depardieu, Patrick's fame never branched out internationally, but he was recognized consistently throughout Europe for his superlative portrayals. Amazingly, he was nominated for seven César awards (the French equivalent of the \"Oscar\") but never won. Patrick's career ended in tragic and still mysterious circumstances. Shortly after the release of the film Paradis pour tous (1982) [Paradise for All], a dark comedy in which his character commits suicide, the 35-year-old actor decided to end his own life by shooting himself with a rifle in a Paris hotel on July 16, 1982. At the time he was working on the Claude Lelouch's film Edith and Marcel (1983). A shocking, inexplicable end to friends, fans and family alike, Dewaere later became the subject of a full-length French documentary Patrick Dewaere (1992), which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. The Patrick Dewaere Award was established in France in 1983.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwOTM1MDQzMzheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU1NDkyMDkx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223033","name":"Patrick Dewaere","idIMDB":"nm0223033"},"actorId":"nm0223033","character":"L'inspecteur Lefèvre","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Victor Lanoux","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0487022","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTY5ZDRkYTktYTQwNi00ZTcxLTgzZTktNTdhZWUwMjk0MDIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 June 1936","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Victor Robert Nataf","bio":"Victor Lanoux was born on June 18, 1936 in Paris, France as Victor Robert Nataf.

And yet, Guiomar first saw himself as a dentist, ... like Daddy! But he finally proved the saying 'Like father like song' wrong. Too bad for dentistry but so much the better for entertainment which otherwise would have had to do without his singular talent. And, to tell the truth, Julien Guiomar did not coddle himself. He indeed appeared in over thirty plays with Jean Vilar's famed Théâtre National Populaire (TNP); he was in more than forty TV films, in which his incredible presence allowed him to embody such figures as Alexandre Borgia or Diafoirus in Molière's Le malade imaginaire (1971). His film parts are even more numerous and include authority figures (colonels, police commissioners, prelates and even God Himself in Arthur Joffé's curious comedy Let There Be Light (1998). As of his first two appearances, in Philippe de Broca's King of Hearts (1966), as a lunatic who takes himself for a bishop and in Louis Malle's The Thief of Paris (1967) as a phony priest, Julien Guiomar has imposed an image of authority tinged with eccentricity. Always colorful in his expression, he can also exert sheer spitefulness (the colonel in Costa-Gavras Z (1969)) or warm humanity (the surgeon of Serge Korber's Je vous ferai aimer la vie (1979)). He may have been in too many campy comedies but he saves them from total crassness by his mere inspired presence. Julien Guiomar retired in 2004 after a final TV Film.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc3NTYxOTE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE4MzI1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0347453","name":"Julien Guiomar","idIMDB":"nm0347453"},"actorId":"nm0347453","character":"Le contrôleur général Ledoux","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pierre Tornade","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868139","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 January 1930","placeOfBirth":" Bort-les-Orgues, Corrèze, France","birthName":"Pierre Tournadre","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Pierre Tornade began his film career playing his first role in Lock Up Your Spoons (1957).
