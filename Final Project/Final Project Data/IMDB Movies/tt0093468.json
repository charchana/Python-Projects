Edith began her career in New York, where she worked extensively on radio soap operas, many of which were live, such as The Guiding Light, Whispering Streets, and Our Gal Sunday. She has said that that was her favorite type of work. Edith took her early steps into television when she was seen as every young boy's heartthrob, the lovely \"Indian\" Princess Summerfall Winterspring on The Howdy Doody Show. In the 1970s she applied her excellent presentation skills as a fashion commentator for Miss USA. She later appeared in 5 episodes of the television series In the Heat of the Night. Over the years, she has portrayed numerous characters in movies such as RoboCop 3, Norma Rae, Little Darlings, and her most recent project starring as Brad Pitt's piano teacher in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Although her love for the theater is very important to her, she has a broad and well-defined life beyond the arts. Edith has lived most of her life in her beloved state of Georgia. In the 1960s, she and her husband Eric moved to Roswell, Georgia, where they raised their two sons, Mark and Nick. Also in the 1960s Edith and her business partner, Jerre Enberg created the successful Ivey-Enberg Talent Services in Atlanta, Ga. Educationally, Edith initially received a degree in drama. She received a degree in religion from Mercer University. She later obtained a Master's degree from Columbia Theological Seminary. In 1996 began offering the Biblical Education Tours. Since that time, she has taken more than fifty groups on tours to places including Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Greece, and Europe. When she is not acting in TV or films, she performs in local theater productions, is active in her church and assists in many community-based organizations.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MDc4OTY0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ0MTI2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0412378","name":"Edith Ivey","idIMDB":"nm0412378"},"actorId":"nm0412378","character":"Amantha Beauregard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Baker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048857","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Richard Baker is known for his work on Teen Wolf (1985), Madhouse (1981) and The Nanny (1993).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048857","name":"Richard Baker","idIMDB":"nm0048857"},"actorId":"nm0048857","character":"Sacha Robertson Jr.","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Devendorf","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0222308","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 February 1944","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Don Charles Devendorf","bio":"Don Devendorf was born on February 16, 1944 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Don Charles Devendorf.
