A powerful and passionate vocalist in the same class as Roy Orbison, he never let fame go to his head and remains a remarkably down to earth person. He left the Hollies three times, once in 1972 to go solo but returned when the band almost fell apart without him. In 2000 he quit for good due to his wife's health. Allan moved on and can be found in the German DJ charts as sometime guitarist for German dance pop act Et Cetera, who like to cover his songs.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0164646","name":"Allan Clarke","nicknames":["Clarkey"],"idIMDB":"nm0164646"},"actorId":"nm0164646","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bobby Elliott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2499746","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 December 1941","placeOfBirth":" Burnley, Lancashire, England, UK","birthName":"Robert Hartley Elliott","bio":"Bobby Elliott was born on December 8, 1941 in Burnley, Lancashire, England as Robert Hartley Elliott.

His aunt bought him his first guitar and he first tasted fame at the age of 11 with a skiffle band called... Les Skifflets. Tony was then a member of a popular Lancashire band; Ricky Shaw and The Dolphins. In late 1962, he was approached by Allan Clarke and Graham Nash to join the Hollies as lead guitarist (he was already known round Lancashire as one of the best lead guitarists). Tony wasn't too sure about joining the Hollies at first but after listening through an air vent at a Manchester club to the early Hollies line-up, he soon changed his mind! The Hollies were soon signed up at the famous Abbey Road studios under the Parlophone label (same as the Beatles). As a member of the Hollies, Tony contributed to the three-part harmony sound, his amazing guitar work and solos as well as using one of the first banjos on a pop record ever (listen to Stop! Stop! Stop!). Tony also wrote songs with the band. 40 years after the first gig with the band, Tony is still out there touring with the Hollies - catch him or miss out!","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382977","name":"Tony Hicks","idIMDB":"nm0382977"},"actorId":"nm0382977","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Graham Nash","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0621726","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NTc3MTU2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ1MDU5Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 February 1942","placeOfBirth":" Blackpool, Lancashire, England, UK","birthName":"Graham William Nash","bio":"Graham Nash was born on February 2, 1942 in Blackpool, Lancashire, England as Graham William Nash.
