Before fame, He was born in Venezuela and lived in Spain for five years. He typically plays villains, especially the leaders of drug cartels, in his films.

His other films include Another 48 Hrs., The Hunt for Red October, A Low Down Dirty Shame, Air Force One and Toy Soldiers. Divoff played the lead role in the Midnight Syndicate's Indie horror flick The Dead Matter. Divoff's television guest appearances include The A-Team, JAG and Highlander: The Series.

He later appeared, in flashbacks, in \"One of Us,\" and reappeared in the episodes \"D.O.C.\", \"The Man Behind the Curtain\", \"Through the Looking Glass\" and \"The Package\". Divoff's latest work was his recurring role as Ivan Sarnoff on CSI: Miami Season 7 (2008-2009). Ivan Sarnoff was a Russian Mobster leader who owned an MMA fighting studio in S07E04 Raging Cannibal. Ivan also ran a horse race betting scam in S07E13 And They're Offed. Then Ivan targets the CSI team in S07E19 Target Specific.

Venezuela born of Russian/Irish descent Divoff is an alumnus of Georgetown University, where he honed his skills in the study of languages, the result seeing him speak eight languages fluently. Andrew is a S.A.G actor and film producer with more than a hundred movies (including 'Toy Soliders', 'Another 48 Hours', 'Air Force One', and 'You Can't Kill The Bogeyman') and television (including 'Lost', 'CSI', and 'Twilight Zone') episodes to his credit.

People acknowledged Andrew Divoff and his work from The WishMaster series, though other fans may have noticed him before in movies like Oblivion (1994) and Toy Soldiers (1991). Almost every movie you see Andrew in he always plays the bad guy, which is what we love best about him. A very shy boy when he was younger, Andrew always had the sense of humor no one else could understand. Born in San Tome, Venezuela Andrew Divoff currently resides in Los Angeles. First audition for Andrew was over a pay phone speaking Russian. Andrew has both a high school and college degree.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NzM4MTk0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDI2OTE3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0228678","name":"Andrew Divoff","nicknames":["Andy"],"idIMDB":"nm0228678"},"actorId":"nm0228678","character":"M","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0085836","main":true},{"actorName":"Clare Leach","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1040636","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Clare Leach is an actress, known for Faust (2000).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1040636","name":"Clare Leach","idIMDB":"nm1040636"},"actorId":"nm1040636","character":"Nurse Ida","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Francisco Maestre","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535481","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 July 1957","placeOfBirth":" Mérida, Badajoz, Extremadura, Spain","birthName":"Francisco Maestre Soriano","bio":"Francisco Maestre was born on July 2, 1957 in Mérida, Badajoz, Extremadura, Spain as Francisco Maestre Soriano.
