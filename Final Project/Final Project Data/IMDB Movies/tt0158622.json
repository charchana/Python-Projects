His family lived nearby in Dunkeld, where his father was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family (including his brother, Tom) moved to Fassfern near Fort William, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969, where Alan's father took up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate; it was there that Alan grew up. He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 'O' Grades and 4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee. There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, \"Tops\", and was also the \"Young Alan\" who answered readers' letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed a cabaret double act with fellow student Forbes Masson called Victor and Barry, which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour), records (\"Hear Victor and Barry and Faint\", \"Are We Too Loud?\") and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made his professional theater and film debuts in \"Macbeth\" at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow and in Gillies MacKinnon's \"Passing Glory\". After graduating, Alan worked extensively in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera High Road (1980) before moving to London when \"Conquest of the South Pole\", a play by German playwright Manfred Karge, transferred from the Traverse Theatre in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988. Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in \"Accidental Death of an Anarchist\", which he also adapted with director Tim Supple. The production was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy Performance of the Year. Then his film career began with Ian Sellar's Prague (1992), in which he starred with Sandrine Bonnaire and Bruno Ganz. The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In the same year he made two films for the BBC - Screen Two: The Last Romantics (1992) and Bernard and the Genie (1991), the latter winning him the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier awards he was also nominated for Comedy Performance of the Year for \"La Bete\". In 1993 he played Hamlet for the English Touring Theare to great critical acclaim (\"An actor knocking on the door of greatness\" - Daily Mail; ranked first and second--with his performance in \"Cabaret\"--in the Daily Telegraph's performances of the year) and then immediately went on to play the Emcee in Sam Mendes' revival of \"Cabaret\" at the same venue (London's Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for \"Cabaret\", and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination. In 1994 he made his first Hollywood film, Le cercle des amies (1995), and his performance as the oleaginous Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (Emma (1996) and GoldenEye (1995)) brought him to the attention of American producers, and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997) and Buddy (1997). He returned to the UK in 1997 to work with Stanley Kubrick and the Spice Girls before returning stateside in 1998 to reprise his role in \"Cabaret\" on Broadway. The show and his portrayal were a sensation, and he received the Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics' Circle, Theatre World, FANY, New York Press and New York Public Advocate's awards for his performance. Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001's \"Design for Living\" on Broadway and the hugely successful off-Broadway \"Elle\" by Jean Genet, which he adapted and played the lead in 2002. His films have included Julie Taymor's Titus (1999), Urbania (2000), the \"Spy Kids\" trilogy, Josie et les Pussycats (2001), X-Men 2 (2003), Nicholas Nickleby (2002), Son of the Mask (2005) and the Showtime movie musical Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005). He wrote, directed, produced and acted in The Anniversary Party (2001) with Jennifer Jason Leigh, which premiered at the Cannes Film festival in 2002 and went on to win a National Board of Review award and two Independent Spirit award nominations. More recently he has produced the documentary Show People (2004) and the films Sweet Land (2005) and Full Grown Men (2006) (and appears in both) and acted in Gray Matters (2006) opposite Heather Graham and Bam Bam and Celeste (2005) opposite Margaret Cho. In 2006, he returned to Broadway as Macheath in \"The Threepenny Opera\". He has also found the time to write a novel, \"Tommy's Tale\", in 2002.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MjM0NDI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg1ODE0Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001086","name":"Alan Cumming","idIMDB":"nm0001086"},"actorId":"nm0001086","character":"Gazoo / Mick Jagged","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000552","main":true},{"actorName":"Harvey Korman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0466327","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NDMzMzc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA2NjM3MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 February 1927","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Harvey Herschel Korman","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"Harvey Korman was a lanky, popular TV comedy veteran with a flair for broad comic characterizations, who shone for a decade as leading man and second banana par excellence on The Carol Burnett Show (1967) but failed to find much success in his own projects. Harvey Herschel Korman was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Ellen (Blecher) and Cyril Raymond Korman, a salesman. His parents, both immigrants, were from Russian Jewish families. A persistent TV presence since the early 1960s, Korman's first big break was a stint as a featured performer on The Danny Kaye Show (1963), a lively musical variety series. Here Korman began working in the format which he would soon master--providing sturdy support to a multi-talented star in a wide variety of comedy sketches. Boasting large, expressive features and a wonderfully mutable voice, Korman could play a wide assortment of characters. Perhaps his first classic characterization was provided for The Flintstones (1960) wherein he was the distinctively snooty voice of The Great Gazoo, a little helmeted space man from the future consigned to the Earth's past in punishment for his crimes. Korman garnered four Emmys for his work with Carol Burnett over the years. Her show never recovered from his departure in 1977 to pursue other projects. Ironically Korman would never again find such a successful showcase for his talents though he certainly tried, appearing in several busted pilots and short-lived sitcoms. Like 'Dan Aykroyd', a later somewhat comparable talent, he fared best in sketch comedy. Almost exclusively a comic actor, he stretched a bit to play straight man Bud Abbott opposite Buddy Hackett's Lou Costello in the disappointing TV biopic Bud and Lou (1978). Korman also directed and/or produced sitcom episodes and TV comedy specials. An occasional actor in films, Korman made his feature debut with a supporting role in The Last of the Secret Agents? (1966). Several film roles followed until he gained his widest exposure with a major supporting role in 'Mel Brooks''s classic Western spoof Blazing Saddles (1974). Korman also fared well in Brooks' High Anxiety (1977) and History of the World: Part I (1981). Korman acted in two 1994 features: the blockbuster live-action version of The Flintstones (1994) (providing the voice of the Dictabird) and the poorly received but lavishly produced Radioland Murders (1994).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NDMzMzc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA2NjM3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0466327","name":"Harvey Korman","nicknames":["Mr.Happy Go-Lucky","Harv"],"idIMDB":"nm0466327"},"actorId":"nm0466327","character":"Colonel Slaghoople","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0055671","main":true},{"actorName":"Alex Meneses","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005224","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODcwNjUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1NzY2NjE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 February 1965","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Alexandra Estella DeAnna Meneses","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Alexandra \"Alex\" Meneses, the ALMA Award nominated actress known for her smoldering bombshell roles and philanthropic work has been cast as popular diva actress \"Isabella\" on Telenovela (2015), Eva Longoria's new NBC series. Alex first made a splash in the 1990s as \"Teresa Morales\" in the hit series, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993), followed by an ALMA Award-nominated role as \"Stefania Fogagnolo\", Robert's Italian girlfriend on Everybody Loves Raymond (1996), and Joey Tribiani's sister, \"Cookie\", on Friends (1994). Other memorable TV appearances have included roles on The Goldbergs (2013), Castle (2009), Prison Break (2005), NCIS (2003), Psych (2006), Austin & Ally (2011) and the voices of \"Svetlana\" and \"Fabrizia\" on The Cleveland Show (2009). On film, the Chicago native and former model has appeared in Selena (1997), Boyle Heights (2010), The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas (2000), and the New York Film Critics Circle Award-winning, Auto Focus (2002), opposite Greg Kinnear. In July 2014, Alex was Mistress of Ceremonies for \"Ischia Global Film Festival\" in Italy. Alex is the Executive Producer of the 2015 Noble Awards, which honors celebrities for their humanitarian work. These awards are held in Los Angeles. As president and founder of her own production company, (OOLaLa Productions/LADDS Entertainment), Alex produced the Sundance Channel hit documentary Damned to Heaven, a gripping look at life inside the FLDS (Fundamental Church of Jesus Christ Later Day Saints) pluralistic community of Colorado City, Arizona. She also executive produced Australians Hit Hollywood, an honest look at Australians and New Zealanders who have turned themselves into prominent players in the Hollywood entertainment scenes. Growing up in Chicago, Alex was inspired to pursue a career in acting while still in high school after seeing Rita Moreno's performance in West Side Story. After signing with an agent, Alex began going on commercial auditions. During summer breaks, she also enrolled in the famed Second City Improv program. Following high school, Alex landed a modeling contract and moved to Europe where she worked regularly in France, Greece and Italy. Upon her return to the US, she entered The Lee Strasberg Theater Institute to hone her acting skills. She has received acclaim in Los Angeles theatre including the Geffen Playhouse's production of Oscar and Felix: A New Look at The Odd Couple by Neil Simon. An adapted revival of The Odd Couple, Simon altered the ethnicity of Oscar & Felix's neighboring sisters to Spanish, which fit Meneses who is half Mexican-American. Alex has appeared in numerous stage productions including Hortensia and the Museum of Dreams at Chicago's Victory Gardens Theater. In her on-going commitment to philanthropy and volunteerism, Alex serves as a board member for many organizations including The Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, United Hope for Animals, The Los Angeles Symphony, and The Chicago Symphony and is a member of The Chicago Historical Society. A devoted alumna of Chicago's Mother McCauley Liberal Arts High School, Alex frequently returns to campus and meets with students to share her insights and commitment to a McAuley education.

As schoolboys, he and Nick would sit around and daydream about the band they would one day front. It was then that they finalized a timeline for the band: they were to play Hammersmith Odeon by 1982, Wembley Arena by 1983, and Madison Square Garden by 1984. They managed to accomplish their goal, and also became one of England's biggest acts worldwide. However, their success was short-lived as internal tensions drove the band to split in two. John, with guitarist Andy Taylor, formed the splinter group Power Station, with singer Robert Palmer and drummer Tony Thompson, most well-known for his drumming with Diana Ross, Chic and David Bowie. Power Station's music was more rock-oriented than what Duran Duran had been doing. Remaining members Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, and Roger Taylor (no relation to the drummer of Queen, or either Taylor in the band) formed the avant garde band, Arcadia. These two bands, in turn, splintered Durannies (the fanatical, at times obsessive Duran Duran fans) into two groups as well, not knowing whose side to be on. This was a short-term problem, however, as Andy and Roger Taylor separately left the group in the 1985-1986 period. The recording of their fourth studio album, \"Notorious\", became a nightmare with remaining members arguing, John threatening to leave the group too, and them having to resort to suing Andy to get him to come record. No one is now sure which guitarist appears on what song (aside from Andy, they also used Nile Rodgers on some songs, who also produced the album, and Warren Cuccurullo, formerly of Missing Persons and later to become a member of Duran Duran). By the release of their album, their popularity had waned, especially when fans heard a different, more mature sound. They were no longer just pop, and had ventured into a more funky territory. As their popularity waned and all but dried up into the rest of the 80s and early 90s, John met and eventually married hopeful actress Amanda De Cadenet. The two also had a daughter a couple months later, Atlanta Noo Taylor (Noo is short for Noodlehead, not Knew as the press reported). The marriage was short-lived, as arguments and rumours of infidelity caused the couple to file for separation in 1995. Their divorce was finalized in 1997. Around this time, John's tensions with the band reached a head. With each album, John threatened more and more to leave the band and, in early 1997 at the DuranCon, he finally announced to everyone, including the band, that he was leaving. He'd already recorded and released some solo material, so he wasn't really leaving to go solo, at least not in terms of music. With his divorce and drug problems (since the early 90s, he'd tried to kick his coke habit), he felt he needed to be free of everything for once. In 1999, he finally regained some stability in his life and married Gela Nash, co-founder of the hugely successful \"Juice Couture\". Also, in 2001, things came full circle as he and the rest of the Taylors announced they would be rejoining Duran Duran.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxNjE3OTU0ODZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDMwNzIxNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852616","name":"John Taylor","nicknames":["J.T.","Noodlehead"],"idIMDB":"nm0852616"},"actorId":"nm0852616","character":"Keith Rockhard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0033483","main":true},{"actorName":"Tony Longo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0519440","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjkxNDEzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ2NTAzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 August 1958","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","birthName":"Anthony Longo","height":"6' 6½\" (1.99 m)","bio":"Tony Longo was a working character actor for more than three decades.

Since his first appearance on the show in 1994 he has gained speed as an actor and garnered respect from industry professionals. His character on Seinfeld was an important role for him, in the sense that the writing and portrayal of Mickey is positive and non-stereotypical. Danny has raised awareness of the continued derogatory and dehumanizing treatment of Little People in society and the media. He serves on the Performers With Disabilities Committee of the Screen Actors Guild.
