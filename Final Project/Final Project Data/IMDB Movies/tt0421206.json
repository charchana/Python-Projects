His father is black (of Black Nova Scotian descent), and his mother is of Samoan background (her own father was Peter Fanene Maivia, also a professional wrestler). While growing up, Dwayne traveled around a lot with his parents and watched his father perform in the ring. During his high school years, Dwayne began playing football and he soon received a full scholarship from the University of Miami where he had tremendous success as a football player. In 1995, Dwayne suffered a back injury which cost him a place in the NFL. He then signed a 3 year deal with the Canadian League but left after a year to pursue a career in wrestling. He made his wrestling debut in the USWA under the name Flex Kavanah where he won the tag team championship with Brett Sawyer. In 1996, Dwayne joined the WWE and became Rocky Maivia where he joined a group known as \"The Nation of Domination\" and turned heel. Rocky eventually took over leadership of the \"Nation\" and began taking the persona of The Rock. After the \"Nation\" split, The Rock joined another elite group of wrestlers known as the \"Corporation\" and began a memorable feud with Steve Austin. Soon the Rock was kicked out of the \"Corporation\". He turned face and became known as \"The Peoples Champion\". In 2000, the Rock took time off from WWE to film his appearance in The Mummy Returns (2001). He returned in 2001 during the WCW/ECW invasion where he joined a team of WWE wrestlers at The Scorpion King (2002), a prequel to The Mummy Returns (2001). Dwayne has a daughter, Simone Alexandra, born in 2001, with his ex-wife Dany Garcia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNDQ3NzAxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIwMTQ0NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0425005","name":"Dwayne Johnson","nicknames":["The People's Champion","The Brahma Bull","The Great One","The Rock","Dewey"],"idIMDB":"nm0425005"},"actorId":"nm0425005","character":"Sean Porter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020435","main":true},{"actorName":"Xzibit","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0944702","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0ODYxOTE4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAzODU0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 September 1974","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Alvin Nathaniel Joiner","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Xzibit was born in Detroit, where he lived until his mother passed away when he was only nine years old. At the age of ten, he began to rap, very personally because of the loss of his mother. At the age of 14, he got into trouble and was removed from his home for two years after his father refused to have him there. Xzibit was released from the state on his own recognizance as an adult at 17. He did a little slangin' to get some money together and jumped into his jeep and headed toward LA, California. In 1992, Xzibit met with producer Broadway, through the group, Madcap. His first songs were \"Freestyle Ghetto\" on \"King Tee IV Life\", and after that he got on the Liks' \"Coast ][ Coast\" on the joints, \"Hit and Run\". He points to his mother, who was a writer, as his source of creativity. Xzibit's rhymes resonate because he speaks from the heart as an individual, rather than trying to portray a phony hip hop persona. He has lived through many dramatic times in his life, so he raps primarily about his own life experiences, and is not afraid to reveal himself on a track. Xzibit eventually found himself working with Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, and helped on Dre's 2001. Through that work he became good friends with Dre, Snoop, Eminem, and others on the Aftermath staff. He is now a father, too.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0ODYxOTE4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAzODU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0944702","name":"Xzibit","nicknames":["X","X to the Z","Black John McClane"],"idIMDB":"nm0944702"},"actorId":"nm0944702","character":"Malcolm Moore","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020436","main":true},{"actorName":"L.
