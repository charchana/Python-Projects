His parents divorced when Pegg was seven. He later took his stepfather's surname, \"Pegg\". He was educated at Brockworth Comprehensive Secondary School in Gloucestershire and went on to Stratford-upon-Avon College to study English literature and performance studies. He then attended the University of Bristol, and earned a bachelor's degree in drama. In the early 1990s, Pegg moved to London and began forging a successful career in stand-up comedy. Television opportunities followed including roles in Six Pairs of Pants (1995), Asylum (1996) and We Know Where You Live (1997). In 1999, Pegg and Jessica Hynes teamed up to write and star in cult sitcom Spaced (1999), directed by Edgar Wright. The series also featured Pegg's best friend, Nick Frost. Pegg's breakthrough in film came with the zom-rom-com Shaun of the Dead (2004), which he also co-wrote with director Edgar Wright. Again, the film featured Nick Frost. The trio also scored a hit with police comedy Hot Fuzz (2007). Further film successes followed for Pegg, notably in the iconic role of Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott in Star Trek (2009) and alongside Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible III (2006) and Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwODE1NjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY5MzM2OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670408","name":"Simon Pegg","idIMDB":"nm0670408"},"actorId":"nm0670408","character":"Shaun","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004743","main":true},{"actorName":"Kate Ashfield","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038918","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1MzAxNjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE1Mjc1OA@@._V1_UY44_CR18,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 May 1972","placeOfBirth":" Oldham, Lancashire, England, UK","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Most recognizable to international audiences for her lead role in Shaun of the Dead (2004), Kate Ashfield is a powerful British actress known for superlative and award-winning work in This Little Life (2003) (B.I.F.A. nomination, Best Actress), Late Night Shopping (2001) (B.I.F.A.

Meath, Ireland","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Irish comedian Dylan Moran was born in Navan, County Meath in 1971. Leaving school without any qualifications at age 16, Moran quickly became attracted to stand-up comedy and debuted, in 1992, at a comedy club in Dublin, The Comedy Cellar. A year later, he won the Channel Four comedy newcomer's \"So You Think You're Funny\" award at the Edinburgh Festival, and began developing his comedy routines into a one-man show, \"Gurgling for Money\", for which he won the prestigious Perrier Comedy Award in 1996, and which he subsequently took to a nationwide tour of the UK. His exposure at the Edinburgh Festival also led to him getting programmed at international stand-up comedy festivals, worldwide. Subsequently, Moran took to writing and performing for British television. He has starred in the BBC sitcom, How Do You Want Me? (1998), and - more importantly - in 2000, he was commissioned by Channel Four for the sitcom, Black Books (2000). He wrote and starred in three 6-episode series of this comedy. Co-starring popular British stand-up comedian Bill Bailey, who was nominated for the Perrier Award the year Moran won, Black Books (2000) sees Moran play a character close to his stand-up comedy persona: an unsociable misanthrope, reminiscent of the John Cleese sitcom character, \"Basil Fawlty\", that shares a great love of wine with one of razor-sharp put-downs of all things human. Also, his character Bernard Black's often surreal views on everyday things and on human behavior is close to his stand-up persona's dealing with them. The same year the first series of \"Black Books\" aired, Moran took his one-man show, \"Ready, Steady, Cough\", on a UK tour, followed two years later by Dylan Moran: Monster (2004). This was followed by Monster II in 2004. In the late 1990's, Moran also moved from doing stand-up to working on a film acting CV. He played opposite Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in Notting Hill (1999), co-starred with Michael Caine in The Actors (2003) and had parts in the Simon Pegg comedy, Shaun of the Dead (2004) and the Michael Winterbottom film, Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story (2005). Moran's live stand-up comedy is unique in that it merges two strands of stand-up that seemed incompatible for a long time: sharp observational humor, and surreal and fantastical language-based absurdity. On the one hand, he has a clear influence from what could be called an American school of stand-up comedy that is heavily observational. On the other hand, Moran's comedy is characterized by a use of language similar to the stand-up comedy of Eddie Izzard and Ross Noble: surreal associative leaps between on the one side observations and on the other fantasies, verbally painting bizarre and absurd worlds, often through a use of stream-of-consciousness narration. His language is often highly poetic, resembling a James Joyce that has had one too many. Moran is very reluctant to give interviews on his personal life and even on his career, a fact parodied in a staged interview inter-cut with the recording of his live stand-up show, \"Monster\", on its DVD release.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMjM2Mjk1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTIwMzE3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0602836","name":"Dylan Moran","idIMDB":"nm0602836"},"actorId":"nm0602836","character":"David","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004747","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicola Cunningham","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684741","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nicola Cunningham is an actress, known for Shaun of the Dead (2004), Trauma (2004) and Look Around You (2002).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684741","name":"Nicola Cunningham","idIMDB":"nm1684741"},"actorId":"nm1684741","character":"Mary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0078752","main":true},{"actorName":"Keir Mills","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1022891","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDM2OTA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU0MzEzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Keir Mills is an actor, known for Shaun of the Dead (2004), Honeymoon (2007) and City Rats (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDM2OTA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU0MzEzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1022891","name":"Keir Mills","idIMDB":"nm1022891"},"actorId":"nm1022891","character":"Clubber 1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0078753","main":true},{"actorName":"Matt Jaynes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419773","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Matt Jaynes is an actor, known for Shaun of the Dead (2004).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0419773","name":"Matt Jaynes","idIMDB":"nm0419773"},"actorId":"nm0419773","character":"Clubber 2","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0078753","main":true},{"actorName":"Gavin Ferguson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684719","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Gavin Ferguson is an actor, known for Shaun of the Dead (2004).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684719","name":"Gavin Ferguson","idIMDB":"nm1684719"},"actorId":"nm1684719","character":"Football Kid","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0078754","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Serafinowicz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784818","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNDU1MjcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc1OTQ0NDE@._V1_UY44_CR23,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 July 1972","placeOfBirth":" Liverpool, England, UK","birthName":"Peter Szymon Serafinowicz","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Peter Serafinowicz was born on July 10, 1972 in Liverpool, England as Peter Szymon Serafinowicz.
