He is of English, Scottish, Cornish, and Irish ancestry. Robert's mother died in 1955, the year after he graduated from high school. Robert was a scrappy kid who stole hubcaps in school and lost his college baseball scholarship at the University of Colorado because of drunkenness. After leaving UoC, he spent some time drifting across America, spending a time working in the California oil fields. Having saved enough he moved to Europe studying art in Paris and Florence.Back in the States he decided on a career as a theatrical designer in New York. Enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Art he turned to acting making his stage debut in 'Tall Story'. In 1962 he was signed for the stage production of 'Barefoot in the Park' which was a smash hit but it wasn't until 5 years later when it was filmed that he became an important star. Television and stage experience coupled with all-American good looks led to movies and television roles. His breakthrough role was \"The Sundance Kid\" in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), when the actor was 32. The Way We Were (1973) and The Sting (1973), both in 1973, made Redford the number one box office star for the next three years. Redford used his clout to advance environmental causes and his riches to acquire Utah property, which he transformed into a ranch and the Sundance ski resort. In 1980, he established the Sundance Institute for aspiring filmmakers. Its annual film festival has become one of the world's most influential. Redford's directorial debut, Ordinary People (1980), won him the Academy Award as Best Director in 1981. He waited eight years before getting behind the camera again, this time for the screen version of John Nichols' acclaimed novel of the Southwest, The Milagro Beanfield War (1988). He scored with critics and fans in 1992 with the Brad Pitt film A River Runs Through It (1992), and again, in 1994, with Quiz Show (1994), which earned him yet another Best Director nomination. Lola Van Wagenen (consumer activist), born in 1940, dropped out of college to marry Redford on September 12, 1958. They divorced in 1985 after having four children, one of whom died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Daughter Shauna Redford, born November 15, 1960, is a painter who married Eric Schlosser on October 5, 1985, in Provo, UT. Her first child, born in January 1991, made Redford a grandfather. Son James Redford (aka Jamie Redford), a screenwriter, was born May 5, 1962. Daughter Amy Redford, an actress; was born October 22, 1970. Redford also has a brother named William.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1Nzc5MzQyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ5OTA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000602","name":"Robert Redford","nicknames":["Bob"],"idIMDB":"nm0000602"},"actorId":"nm0000602","character":"Jack Weil","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0408437","main":true},{"actorName":"Lena Olin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000565","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Nzc2ODMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg4ODgwMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 March 1955","placeOfBirth":" Stockholm, Stockholms län, Sweden","birthName":"Lena Maria Jonna Olin","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Swedish-born Lena Olin already had a successful career as an actress before she came to Hollywood. She acted at the Royal Theatre in Stockholm and was directed by Ingmar Bergman. She was born in Stockholm, to actors Britta Holmberg and Stig Olin, who appeared in six of Bergman's films. Lena also belongs to the Bergman \"family\". As a young actress, she played in the great classics of William Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg. She made her international debut as a movie actress in After the Rehearsal (1984) (aka \"After the Rehearsal\"), directed by Bergman. In western Europe, she became well-known in the political movie The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988) as \"Sabina\", in a story about the Prague spring (1968). After coming to the US, she played mostly distinguished, exotic temptresses, intelligent women and crude vamps. Bergman had developed Lena's artistic gift to play different human emotions and express them in a subtle way. Sydney Pollack, director of Out of Africa (1985), rewrote the screenplay for Havana (1990) especially for her. This explains why this film recalls associations with the classic Casablanca (1942), starring Ingrid Bergman, also from Sweden. Olin received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Enemies: A Love Story (1989). She went on to have a choice role in Chocolat (2000), which received a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. She made a move to the smaller screen and played the role for one season as the deliciously evil \"Irina Derevko\", the mother to Jennifer Garner's \"Sydney Bristow\" in the series Alias (2001). Olin received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Nzc2ODMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg4ODgwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000565","name":"Lena Olin","idIMDB":"nm0000565"},"actorId":"nm0000565","character":"Bobby Duran","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alan Arkin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000273","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDk5Njc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc5NDc0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 March 1934","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Alan Wolf Arkin","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Alan Arkin is an Academy Award-winning American actor who is also an acclaimed director, producer, author, singer and composer. He was born Alan Wolf Arkin on March 26, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York. His family were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Germany. In 1946 the Arkins moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, California. His father, David I. Arkin, was an artist and writer, who worked as a teacher, and lost his job for merely refusing to answer questions about his political affiliation during the 1950s Red Scare. His father challenged the politically biased dismissal and eventually prevailed, but unfortunately it was after his death. His mother, Beatrice (Wortis) Arkin, a teacher, shared his fathers views. Young Arkin was fond of music and acting, he was taking various acting classes from the age of 10. He attended Franklin High School, in Los Angeles, then Los Angeles City College from 1951 - 1953, and Bennington College in Vermont from 1953 - 1954. He sang in a college folk-band, and was involved in a drama class. He dropped out of college to form the folk music group The Tarriers, in which Arkin was the lead singer and played guitar. He co-wrote the 1956 hit \"The Banana Boat Song\" - a Jamaican calypso folk song, which became better known as Harry Belafonte's popular version, and reached #4 on the Billboard chart. At that time Arkin was a struggling young actor who played bit parts on television and on stage, and made a living as a delivery boy, repairman, pot washer and baby sitter. From 1958 - 1968 he performed and recorded with the children's folk group, The Babysitters. He has also recorded an entire album for the Elektra label titled \"Folksongs - Once Over Lightly.\" In 1957 Arkin made his first big screen appearance as a lead singer with The Tarriers in Calypso Heat Wave (1957). Then he made his Off-Broadway debut as a singer in \"Heloise\" (1958). Next year he joined the Compass Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri. There he caught the eye of stage director Bob Sills and became the original member of the \"Second City\" troupe in Chicago. In 1961 Arkin made his Broadway debut in musical \"From the Second City\", for which he wrote lyrics and sketches, then starred as David Kolowitz in the Broadway comedy \"Enter Laughing\" (1963), for which he won a Tony Award. He starred in a Broadway musical \"From the Second City production, then returned to Broadway as Harry Berlin in \"Luv\" (1964). Arkin made his directorial debut with an Off-Broadway hit called \"Eh?\" (1966), which introduced the young actor, named Dustin Hoffman. He won a Drama Desk Award for his direction of the Off-Broadway production of \"Little Murders\" (1969), and another Drama Desk Award for \"The White House Murder Case\" (1970). He also directed the original version of Neil Simon's hilarious smash, \"The Sunshine Boys\" (1972), which ran over 500 performances. Arkin earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his feature acting debut in a comedy The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966), by director Norman Jewison, co-starring as Lt. Rozanov, a Soviet submariner who is mistaken for a spy after his boat accidentally wrecks aground in New England. Arkin demonstrated his dramatic range as the psychopathic killer Roat in suspense film Wait Until Dark (1967), opposite Audrey Hepburn. He reinvented himself as the sensitive deaf-mute in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968), for which he received his second Academy Award nomination as Best Actor in the Leading role. He followed with what remained his best known role as Captain Yossarian in Catch-22 (1970), directed by Mike Nichols and based on the eponymous anti-war novel by Joseph Heller. In it Arkin arguably gave his strongest performance, however, his career suffered because the film initially did not live up to expectations. After a few years of directorial work on television, Arkin made a comeback with an impressive portrayal of doctor Sigmund Freud in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976). In the early 1980s he acted in three movies that were family affairs, written by his wife, Barbara Dana, and co-starring his son, Adam Arkin. During the 1990s he turned out several notable performances, such as a bitter former baseball player in TNT's Cooperstown (1993), and as a hilarious psychiatrist opposite John Cusack in Grosse Pointe Blank (1997). He won raves for his portrayal of a divorced father who struggles to keep his kids enrolled in the Beverly Hills school system in Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). Arkin gave a brilliant performance opposite Robin Williams in Jakob le menteur (1999), a film about the Nazi occupation of Poland. He also returned to the New York stage co-starring with his son, Tony Arkin and Elaine May in \"Power Plays\", which he also co-authored. His most recent comeback as a heroin-snorting, sex-crazed, foul-mouthed grandfather in Little Miss Sunshine (2006), earned him his third Academy Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, and his first Academy Award. Alan Arkin has been a modern Renaissance man. In addition to his achievements as an actor, director, and producer, he made his mark as a singer-songwriter with his popular-song compositions \"Banana Boat Song\", \"Cuddle Bug,\" \"That's Me,\" and \"Best Time of the Year.\" Arkin also authored several books, including science-fiction and some children's stories, such as \"The Clearing\", \"The Lemming Condition\" and \"Cassie Loves Beethoven\" among his other publications. He is a father of three sons, Adam, Matthew, and Tony, and a grandfather of Molly Arkin. Alan Arkin has been a strong supporter of an organic way of living and also a proponent for preservation of the environment and natural habitat. He has been avoiding the show-biz-milieu and is known as an actor who does not really care about prestigious awards, but values having a good job and being acknowledged by his peers. In Arkin's own words he wants to \"Stay home for three months. Living as quietly as humanly possible.\" Arkin was given an Indian name, Grey Wolf, by his Native American friends in New Mexico.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDk5Njc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc5NDc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000273","name":"Alan Arkin","nicknames":["The Tarriers"],"idIMDB":"nm0000273"},"actorId":"nm0000273","character":"Joe Volpi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tomas Milian","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587401","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Y1NDJiZWUtM2MxOS00Nzk0LWI3OGEtNjFkMTQ4YzVjYTJiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 March 1933","placeOfBirth":" Havana, Cuba","birthName":"Tomás Quintín Rodríguez Milián","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Tomas Milian, an American actor born in Cuba; was trained at the Actors Studio.

He interpreted a mad psychopath in The Ugly Ones (1966) (aka \"Bounty Killer\"), a role he would then improve and diversify into an impressive gallery of neurotic and sadistic killers, first in \"spaghetti westerns\" (many directed by Sergio Corbucci), and then in violent action and police thrillers (many directed by Umberto Lenzi). His films gradually evolved into action comedies, as he played the recurrent characters of thief \"Er Monnezza\" and cop Nico Giraldi (the latter being originally based on the lead character in Serpico (1973)), two typically Roman characters who enjoyed great popularity in the '70s and '80s.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Y1NDJiZWUtM2MxOS00Nzk0LWI3OGEtNjFkMTQ4YzVjYTJiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587401","name":"Tomas Milian","idIMDB":"nm0587401"},"actorId":"nm0587401","character":"Menocal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Daniel Davis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204425","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MDc0NjU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4MTgzNg@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 November 1945","placeOfBirth":" Gurdon, Arkansas, USA","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"This Arkansas native was born on 26 November 1945 to parents who owned a movie theater. He often felt that his desire to become an actor came from the fact that he spent so much time in the theater's \"crying room\" for babies - and listening to the likes of Tyrone Power and others. His first \"professional\" work came at the age of 11 when he became a member of the cast of a children's TV series broadcast from Little Rock - \"Betty's Little Rascals\". His formal acting training came from the Arkansas Arts Center (a fine arts conservatory with its own repertory company), followed by work with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and 6 years with the American Conservatory Theatre, among many others. He also taught acting classes while at ACT. His love of the theater has continued through his career. He has played in nearly every Shakespeare play and an untold number of musicals (he's an accomplished singer) and straight plays. For the year 2000 Tony Awards, he was recognized with a nomination as best actor in a featured role for his performance in \"Wrong Mountain\". When The Nanny (1993) first went on the air, many people believed that the very British butler \"Niles\" was definitely being played by a British actor.

His riding and stunting skills gained him regular work doubling stars ranging from Roy Rogers to Gary Cooper, and he often doubled the bad guy as well. Although. like most stuntmen, he was occasionally given a line or two of dialogue, it was not until Farnsworth was over 50 that his natural talent for acting and his ease and warmth before the camera became apparent.

His entire family hails from Brooklyn. His folks, Al and Flo, are gone, but he has a brother (Jay), a sister (Gayle), two nephews (John and Sam) and three nieces (Samara, Ilana and Maia). He graduated with a BA degree as a speech and theater major from Brooklyn College. He did not shine while in college, and was discouraged from continuing as an actor with the critique that he was \"hopeless and without any ability or talent\" (he continues to wonder if the faculty was right). He has been a bartender, an antique dealer, a boxer, an international drug trafficker, a fifth-grade teacher in the NYC public school system, a competitive body builder, a truck driver, a bouncer, a bagel maker, a short-order cook, a marathon runner, a designer, a competitive gymnast, a background extra, a disco dancer at the famed \"Arthur\" discotheque, and a confused and aimless layabout. Richard is 6'0\", weighs in at a trim 180 lb. and continues to box. He has excellent defensive skills and his ability to stop punches with his face has made him a local favorite. Portnow assayed the role of attorney Hal \"Mel\" Melvoin on the Emmy-winning HBO series The Sopranos (1999), the lawyer for Uncle Junior, whom he singlehandedly kept out of prison and managed to get placed under house arrest instead. His rates for defending Corrado Soprano (Uncle Juniors's full name) are astronomical, but as Uncle June has said, \"Mel, you're worth every penny\". He has held this role since the show's inception in 1999. Richard began his professional career at the famed Cafe La Mama in New York City, appearing in plays by Tom Eyen, Leonard Melfi, Jeff Weiss, Megan Terry, Tom O'Horgan and Lanford Wilson.
