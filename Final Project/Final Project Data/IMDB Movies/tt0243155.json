Her mother, Kjellfrid Irene (Andreassen), is a Norwegian-born former nurse and midwife, of Norwegian, Kven (Finnish), and Swedish descent. Her father, Emil Erich Zellweger, is a Swiss-born engineer. The two married in 1963. Renée has a brother named Drew Zellweger, a marketing executive born on February 15, 1967. Renée got interested in acting in high school while working on the drama club. She also took an acting class at the University of Texas (Austin), where she began looking towards acting as a career. After graduation, she wanted to continue acting, but Hollywood is a tough town to break into, so Renée decided to stay in Texas, and auditioned for roles around Houston, where she managed to grab roles in such films as Reality Bites (1994) and Empire Records (1995). While on the set for the sequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994), she befriended Matthew McConaughey, another Hollywood up-and-comer. He was working on a project at the time that Renée was interested in, auditioned for, and won the role in the film Love and a .45 (1994), which earned her enough critical praise that she decided to move to Los Angeles. Another role in The Whole Wide World (1996) followed which led to her big break. Cameron Crowe was busy casting his next film, Jerry Maguire (1996), starring Tom Cruise. Crowe was considering such actresses as Cameron Diaz, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder, and Marisa Tomei, when he heard of Zellweger's performance in The Whole Wide World (1996). He auditioned Zellweger and was sure he'd found his Dorothy Boyd. Renée followed her huge success with a few small independent films and after receiving further critical praise, she felt confident enough to reenter the world of big-budget Hollywood films. She starred opposite Meryl Streep in the tear-jerker One True Thing (1998). She also took a role in Me, Myself & Irene (2000), opposite Jim Carrey, and soon after began dating Carrey. The two denied their relationship at first, but finally gave in and admitted it; today they are no longer together. Also in 2000, she starred in the title role in Nurse Betty (2000), where she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical. In 2001, she received even more critical and commercial success in the title role in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). She received her first Academy Award nomination for her role, which was followed by her second Oscar-nominated role in the musical Chicago (2002). She then again wowed audiences with her fierce yet warm portrayal of Ruby Thewes in the film adaptation of Cold Mountain (2003), which won Zellweger an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, which was her first Academy Award.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMzYwMDI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg3NjYwMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000250","name":"Renée Zellweger","nicknames":["Zelly"],"idIMDB":"nm0000250"},"actorId":"nm0000250","character":"Bridget Jones","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003174","main":true},{"actorName":"Gemma Jones","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0428121","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNjE1OTkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MzU2MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 December 1942","placeOfBirth":" Marylebone, London, England, UK","birthName":"Jennifer R.

She reprised the role of Miss Babs in Acorn Antiques: The Musical! in 2005, and won the Olivier Award for Best Supporting Performance in a Musical. Imrie's other television roles include Marianne Bellshade in Bergerac (1983), Diana Neal in After You've Gone (2007-08), Gloria Millington in Kingdom (2007-09), and Miss Kizlet in the 2013 Doctor Who season opener The Bells of Saint John.

She has been described as \"one of the most successful British actresses of recent decades\". Imrie was born in 1952 in Guildford, Surrey, the fourth of five children of Diana Elizabeth Blois (née Cator) and David Andrew Imrie, a radiologist. Her father was from Glasgow, Scotland. Imrie was educated at Guildford High School, an independent school for girls in her hometown of Guildford, followed by the Guildford School of Acting. Imrie's varied career spans films, television and radio drama, and the theatre. Her film credits include Nanny McPhee, Hilary and Jackie (playing Iris du Pré) and the 1997 film of The Borrowers where she played Homily Clock. Other films include Bridget Jones's Diary, Calendar Girls, Highlander and, as Fighter Pilot Bravo 5, in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. In 2004, Imrie played Doctor Imogen Reed in the schoolgirl thriller, Out of Bounds. In 2007 Imrie appeared in St Trinian's. Television series to feature Imrie include The Nightmare Man, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Casualty, Absolutely Fabulous, \"Bergerac\",The Darling Buds of May and Upstairs, Downstairs. In the 2000 miniseries of Gormenghast, she played Lady Gertrude. She also had a guest appearance in an episode of the BBC Scotland sitcom Still Game in 2003, where she played a home help called Mrs Begg. She also appeared in the 2005 BBC television drama Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle, playing the part of a teacher taking an unruly party of pupils on a day-trip to Salisbury Cathedral. She starred in the BBC sitcom, After You've Gone, alongside Nicholas Lyndhurst and in the ITV1 drama Kingdom, with Stephen Fry. Her part in After You've Gone has, whilst being critically acclaimed, been described as \"criminally squandered\". In 2013 she guest starred in the BBC's Doctor Who where she played the villainous Miss Kizlet in the series opener The Bells of Saint John. Her radio work includes parts in BBC Radio 4's No Commitments, Adventures of a Black Bag, and Bleak Expectations. In early 2007, she narrated the book Arabella, broadcast over two weeks as the Book at Bedtime. In May 2016, she made her US television debut in the DC action-adventure series Legends of Tomorrow. Imrie is perhaps best known for her frequent collaborations with Victoria Wood, with whom she has appeared in TV programmes such as the sitcom Dinnerladies and sketch show Victoria Wood As Seen On TV. It was on the latter show in 1985 that she first played the infamous part of Miss Babs, owner of Acorn Antiques, a parody of the low budget British soap opera Crossroads. These sketches became such a British institution that the show was turned into a West End musical in 2005 starring most of the original cast (see the picture on the right). Imrie won an Olivier Award for her performance. The character has curly blonde hair, and is known for her frequent parodic flirtations with the customers, and her abuse of the housekeeper Mrs Overall (portrayed by Julie Walters). Imrie was the guest on Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 on 13 February 2011. On 18 October 2013 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Winchester.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2ODkzOTE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAwODA2NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0408309","name":"Celia Imrie","nicknames":["Impie","Ceals","Celia Impie"],"idIMDB":"nm0408309"},"actorId":"nm0408309","character":"Una Alconbury","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0065222","main":true},{"actorName":"James Faulkner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0269077","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3MDk2MTEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAzNzQ0MDE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 July 1948","placeOfBirth":" Hampstead, London, England, UK","birthName":"James Sebastian Faulkner","bio":"James Faulkner was born on July 18, 1948 in Hampstead, London, England as James Sebastian Faulkner.

Jim attended a Quaker boarding school in Reading before successfully applying for a place at an art school. His heart was in acting, though, and he would later transfer to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). Following his 1972 graduation, he began his professional career on the stage, performing with the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and as part of the National Theatre of Brent, a two-man troupe which he co-founded. In addition to his theatrical work, Broadbent did steady work on television, working for such directors as Mike Newell and Stephen Frears. Broadbent made his film debut in 1978 with a small part in Jerzy Skolimowski's The Shout (1978). He went on to work with Frears again in The Hit (1984) and with Terry Gilliam in Time Bandits (1981) and Brazil (1985), but it was through his collaboration with Mike Leigh that Broadbent first became known to an international film audience. In 1990 he starred in Leigh's Life Is Sweet (1990), a domestic comedy that cast him as a good-natured cook who dreams of running his own business. Broadbent gained further visibility the following year with substantial roles in Neil Jordan's The Crying Game (1992) and Mike Newell's Enchanted April (1991), and he could subsequently be seen in such diverse fare as Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994), Widows' Peak (1994), Richard Loncraine's highly acclaimed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III (1995) and Little Voice (1998), the last of which cast him as a seedy nightclub owner. Appearing primarily as a character actor in these films, Broadbent took center stage for Leigh's Topsy-Turvy (1999), imbuing the mercurial W.S. Gilbert with emotional complexity and comic poignancy. Jim's breakthrough year was 2001, as he starred in three critically and commercially successful films. Many would consider him the definitive supporting actor of that year. First he starred as Bridget's dad (Colin Jones) in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), which propelled Renée Zellweger to an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Next came the multiple Oscar-nominated film (including Best Picture) Moulin Rouge (2001), for which he won a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA award for his scene-stealing performance as Harold Zidler. Lastly, came the small biopic Iris (2001), for which he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as devoted husband John Bayley to Judi Dench's Iris Murdoch, the British novelist who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The film hit home with Jim, since his own mother had passed away from Alzheimer's in 1995.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY4ODgzMTg3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDE4NTc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000980","name":"Jim Broadbent","idIMDB":"nm0000980"},"actorId":"nm0000980","character":"Bridget's Dad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003172","main":true},{"actorName":"Colin Firth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000147","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMDMwMTI4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzQxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 September 1960","placeOfBirth":" Grayshott, Hampshire, England, UK","birthName":"Colin Andrew Firth","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"Colin Andrew Firth was born into an academic family in Grayshott, Hampshire, England.

His grandparents were missionaries. His siblings Katie Firth and Jonathan Firth are also actors. Firth's first acting experience came in infant's school when he played \"Jack Frost\" in a Christmas pantomime. Three of his four grandparents were Methodist missionaries and he spent his early childhood in Nigeria, returning to England at age five where he entered a comprehensive school in Winchester.

He is known for his roles in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), with Andie MacDowell, Notting Hill (1999), opposite Julia Roberts, and Music and Lyrics (2007), opposite Drew Barrymore, among his other works. He was born Hugh John Mungo Grant on September 9, 1960, in Hammersmith, London, United Kingdom. His mother, Fyvola Susan (MacLean), was a teacher. His father, James Murray Grant, was an artist and carpet salesman, and his grandfather was in the British Army during WWII. He is of mostly Scottish and English descent, with many recent ancestors who were prominent in the military. Young Grant was fond of literature and acting. He won a scholarship to Oxford, going up to New College in 1979. There he was involved in student drama, and considered a career as an art historian. After Oxford, he turned down a scholarship to do postgraduate studies in Art History at the Courtauld Institute in London, and focused on his acting career. In 1982, while still a student, Grant made his big screen debut in Privileged (1982) by director Michael Hoffman. Grant's breakthrough came with the leading role as Charles in Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), opposite Andie MacDowell, a role which won him a Golden Globe Award, as well as a BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor. During the 1990s Grant established himself as a very original and resourceful actor. He played a string of characters projecting a positive mindset, showing how do you stay optimistic when you are actually worried about a cascade of troubles. Grant had his own experience as a survivor of an unfortunate episode in his private life, which he managed to overcome thanks to having a pretty damn good outlook on life. His forte is playing characters projecting warmth and sincere happiness, with his hallmark stuttering, albeit some accused him of reprising the same character he has been playing for the past two decades. Grant's ability to show his character development within a limited screen time shines in Love Actually (2003), with his witty portrayal of a Prime Minister whose personal insecurities become intertwined with his country's international affairs, a performance that earned him a nomination for European Audience Award. His screen presence and skillful understatement takes his characters beyond the written script, thanks to his mastery of timing and effortless style. Outside of his acting profession, Grant has been a good athlete, he played cricket and football in his younger years. He enjoys playing golf, frequently taking part in Pro-Am tournaments. He has been an avid art lover since his younger years, and has been collecting fine art, a passion he inherited from his father.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MTgxOTk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMjYwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000424","name":"Hugh Grant","idIMDB":"nm0000424"},"actorId":"nm0000424","character":"Daniel Cleaver","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003176","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Brooke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0111727","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyODk5MTc1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI5ODMwOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 November 1944","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Paul Brooke was born on November 22, 1944 in London, England.
