It's in his blood... However, Brendan was a fairly late starter in the acting industry and didn't get involved until he was 22. He started out as an extra on TV Shows, such has 'Headlands', 'Home and Away', and various commercials before finding he had a natural talent for acting and didn't want to be in the background anymore. He quickly delved head first into his new found lifestyle of filmmaking and acting. He is now 33 and has proven himself to be an up and coming artist, with more than 20 films under his belt. He has continued to impress audiences with his array of method acting skills in roles such as a hitman in the short film 'Bleeding Backs', three lead roles in feature films (among other things), from the lead detective in a mysterious murder case in 'The Navigator', to the desolate father who is grieving his dead wife and daughter in 'Blind Justice' but none more noticeably than the Aussie Outback Horror film 'There's Something In The Pilliga' where his character 'Jay' was described as the love child of 'Chopper Reed' and 'Mick Taylor'. Brendan believes that, in order to get noticed as an actor, you need product, and there just wasn't enough product going around, so, he decided to create his own. Brendan developed his own company called 'Shadow Wolves Productions' and has since written, acted, and produced his own feature films, and also helped produce 'Death's Waiting Room', and his sister's film 'Phoenix Rising' which are both set to be released later this year. Brendan truly is an asset to any production, on and off the camera, Brendan's keen eye for detail and wanting the best out of himself and his peers is what motivates others on a film set. Having Directed indie films himself, he knows how to talk to other directors and also to other actors, therefore also knows how to listen and interpret other directors, he believes to be a good leader you also need to be a good follower, and Brendan can do both.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTBjNTgyNjQtZTZkNi00ZTY4LWJiOGMtZmVjNzBiMDU0Y2I1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQxMTg1ODk@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4257035","name":"Brendan Byrne","idIMDB":"nm4257035"},"actorId":"nm4257035","character":"Jay","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Leoni Leaver","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2487745","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Leoni Leaver is an actress and writer, known for Perished (2011), Death's Waiting Room and There's Something in the Pilliga (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2487745","name":"Leoni Leaver","idIMDB":"nm2487745"},"actorId":"nm2487745","character":"Liz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rebecca Callander","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4409975","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Rebecca Callander is an actress and producer, known for There's Something in the Pilliga (2014), Delirium and Emergency Exit (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4409975","name":"Rebecca Callander","idIMDB":"nm4409975"},"actorId":"nm4409975","character":"Tammy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Craig Hawley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6966713","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Craig Hawley is an actor, known for There's Something in the Pilliga (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6966713","name":"Craig Hawley","idIMDB":"nm6966713"},"actorId":"nm6966713","character":"Inbred Jed","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fay Beck","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3533932","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MDkyNjU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3MTQ5NTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Fay Beck is an actress and director, known for Stroke the Black (2014), There's Something in the Pilliga (2014) and The Makeover (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MDkyNjU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3MTQ5NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3533932","name":"Fay Beck","idIMDB":"nm3533932"},"actorId":"nm3533932","character":"Emma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrew Adams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7086158","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Andrew Adams is an actor, known for There's Something in the Pilliga (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7086158","name":"Andrew Adams","idIMDB":"nm7086158"},"actorId":"nm7086158","character":"Bar Patron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tamsin Baker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7086150","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tamsin Baker is an actress, known for There's Something in the Pilliga (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7086150","name":"Tamsin Baker","idIMDB":"nm7086150"},"actorId":"nm7086150","character":"Stripper 1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bianca Bower","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7086148","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Bianca Bower is an actress, known for There's Something in the Pilliga (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7086148","name":"Bianca Bower","idIMDB":"nm7086148"},"actorId":"nm7086148","character":"Bar Maid","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"J.J.
