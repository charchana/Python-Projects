In fact, in the early portion of Gerald McRaney's career he almost always played the villain; but, since his first series, Simon & Simon (1981), hit it big, he's played mostly good guys. The character of passionate but irresponsible \"Rick Simon\" gave McRaney the opportunity to play a dramatic role with a comedic edge. A second hit series, Major Dad (1989), showcased his talent for comedy. McRaney met and fell in love with fellow southerner Delta Burke when she guest-starred on Simon & Simon (1981). He later appeared on her series, Designing Women (1986), as her ex-husband, although it is an unwritten rule that actors with current series don't do guest roles; they were married not long after.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMDY4NjQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQ1ODgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0574468","name":"Gerald McRaney","nicknames":["Mackie"],"idIMDB":"nm0574468"},"actorId":"nm0574468","character":"Bastian's Father","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011868","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Eastman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0308110","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Chris Eastman is an actor and producer, known for The NeverEnding Story (1984), It (1990) and Hot Rod (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0308110","name":"Chris Eastman","idIMDB":"nm0308110"},"actorId":"nm0308110","character":"1st Bully","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Darryl Cooksey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177530","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Darryl Cooksey is an actor, known for The NeverEnding Story (1984), The Love Tapes (1980) and Emerald Point N.A.S.
