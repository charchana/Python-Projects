Appearances aside, the woman launches an all-out attack on the poor guy, spewing hatred about stereotypes and the usual favourite topics: immigration, employment and overall white supremacy and privilege, to name a few. This scene of verbal violence which is taking place before an uninvolving and deafeningly silent group of commuters, highlights society's numbness, desensitisation and silent concurrence to all things violent.","simplePlot":"A young black man is verbally harassed by an older woman on a streetcar, while the other passengers remain silent.

His work's recurring themes are race, sexual identity, violence and American history. Paul is the recipient of one of the 2012 COLA (City of Los Angeles) Individual Artist Fellowships, which honor ten mid-career artists \"who dedicate themselves to an ongoing body of excellent work, represent a relevant progression through their pieces or series, exemplify a generation of core ideas in their field, garner respect from their peers, and serve as role models for other artists.\" Trained as an actor at the Phillips Exeter Academy and New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, Paul has portrayed an eclectic spectrum of roles that includes James Baldwin, Jeffrey Dahmer, Nat Turner, Sigmund Freud, Jesse Owens, William Randolph Hearst, Donald \"Cinque Mtume\" DeFreeze, Hades Lord of the Underworld, Tom Sawyer, the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, the Scarecrow of Oz, Shakespeare's Mercutio and Beckett's Vladimir.
