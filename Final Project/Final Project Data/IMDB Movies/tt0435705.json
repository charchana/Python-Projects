He is of Italian (father) and Polish, German, and English (mother) descent. Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s. Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career. His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984). In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage (b.1992). In 2004, he married Alice Kim Cage, with whom he has a son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDM4Nzk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwNjExOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115","name":"Nicolas Cage","nicknames":["Nick"],"idIMDB":"nm0000115"},"actorId":"nm0000115","character":"Cris Johnson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0060664","main":true},{"actorName":"Julianne Moore","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000194","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NDI1MjE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE0Nzk0MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 December 1960","placeOfBirth":" Fayetteville, North Carolina, USA","birthName":"Julie Anne Smith","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Julianne Moore was born Julie Anne Smith in Fort Bragg, North Carolina on December 3, 1960, the daughter of Anne (Love), a social worker, and Peter Moore Smith, a paratrooper, colonel, and later military judge. Her mother moved to the U.S. in 1951, from Greenock, Scotland. Her father, from Burlington, New Jersey, has German, Irish, German-Jewish, and English ancestry. Moore spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents, during her father's military career. She finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), She took the stage name \"Julianne Moore\" because there was another actress named \"Julie Anne Smith\". Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress' trap of the mid-1980's: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial The Edge of Night (1956) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap As the World Turns (1956). This performance later led to an Outstanding Ingénue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as Money, Power, Murder. (1989), The Last to Go (1991) and Cast a Deadly Spell (1991). She made her entrance into the big screen with 1990's Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992) and the comedy The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag (1992). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as a doctor who spots Kimble Harrison Ford and attempts to thwart his escape in The Fugitive (1993). (A role that made such an impression on Steven Spielberg that he cast her in the Jurassic Park (1993) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore's most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her \"beguiling Yelena\" from Andre Gregory's workshop version of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in Louis Malle's critically acclaimed Vanya on 42nd Street (1994). Director Todd Haynes gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in Safe (1995). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Later that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as Hugh Grant's pregnant girlfriend in Nine Months (1995). Following films included Assassins (1995), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas) and Surviving Picasso (1996), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, Anthony Hopkins). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg's The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), opposite Jeff Goldblum, a young and unknown director, Paul Thomas Anderson asked Julianne to appear in his movie, Boogie Nights (1997). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in The Big Lebowski (1998), continued with a small role in the social comedy Chicago Cab (1997) and ended with a subtle performance in Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho (1960). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be. She starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune (1999) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged Glenn Close. A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in Oliver Parker's An Ideal Husband (1999) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in Magnolia (1999) and continued with an outstanding performance in The End of the Affair (1999), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination. She ended 1999 with another great performance, that of a grieving mother in A Map of the World (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NDI1MjE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE0Nzk0MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000194","name":"Julianne Moore","nicknames":["Juli"],"idIMDB":"nm0000194"},"actorId":"nm0000194","character":"Callie Ferris","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014078","main":true},{"actorName":"Jessica Biel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004754","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDY2NzMwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIxNTUxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 March 1982","placeOfBirth":" Ely, Minnesota, USA","birthName":"Jessica Claire Biel","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Jessica Biel, with her good looks and talent, has become one of Hollywood's most sought-out actresses.

Having finished filming, Blade: Trinity (2004) in Vancouver with Wesley Snipes, Ryan Reynolds, and Kris Kristofferson, she transported her toned and trained body of a vampire hunter/killer to Australia to fill the uniform and project the integrity of one of filmdom's first female jet-fighter pilots in Columbia/Sony Pictures new film, Stealth (2005), starring Josh Lucas, Jamie Foxx, and Sam Shepherd, for director Rob Cohen.

Born in Laramie, Wyoming a minister's son, he was raised in and around Irving, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Following high school and a year of college, he joined the Marines and served as a radioman with the 1st Marine Division in Vietnam. He attended Oklahoma Christian College (now Oklahoma Christian University), Edmond, OK, where he first became interested in acting as a career. After one year, he transferred to Central State University (now the University of Central Oklahoma), Edmond, OK, and while a student made his professional debut in a production of \"Rain\" at the Oklahoma Theatre Center in 1972. He obtained a degree in theatre and returned to the Dallas area where he worked for five seasons with the Dallas Shakespeare Festival. He had written several plays in college and afterward (as well as a biography of actor John Garfield), and in 1979 he was commissioned for the first of three plays at Actors Theatre of Louisville. He also began to make appearances in bit roles in films and television shows shot in the Dallas area, including Semi-Tough (1977) and Dallas (1978). Moving to New York in 1979, he worked in stock and in dinner theatre tours, and also maintained a side career as a critic, columnist, and feature writer for Films in Review, the magazine of the National Board of Review. An assignment for an article on TV Superman George Reeves led him to Los Angeles. During his research there, his play \"Verdigris\" was produced to solid reviews at Theatre West in Hollywood, and he was signed as a writer by Sam Adams, partner in the prestigious Triad Artists agency. He began a successful period as a television writer, penning episodes for shows such as Vietnam War Story (1987), Tour of Duty (1987), and Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985), and was nominated for a CableAce Award for an episode of the latter. He had continued to act on stage and in small film and TV roles, and in 1988 he landed a substantial supporting role as Bruce Willis's best friend, an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, in Norman Jewison's production In Country (1989). He gave up television writing and concentrated on acting. Slowly his roles grew larger (and more varied). He was Mark Harmon's chain-smoking detective partner Earl Gaddis on Reasonable Doubts (1991) and Edward Asner's dim-witted mechanic assistant Leland on Thunder Alley (1994). He was frequently cast in Westerns (Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), Bad Girls (1994), among many others) or as detectives, sheriffs, or police officers (Sister Act (1992), Sliver (1993), Joy Ride (2001)). After two seasons on 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996) as French Stewart's sullen bar-owner boss Happy Doug, Beaver landed his most prominent and critically acclaimed role, that of Ellsworth, the gruff but decent and beloved prospector in the landmark Western series Deadwood (2004). Nominated along with other cast members for a 2006 Screen Actors Guild Award, he found his career in high gear following that series. From it he moved to the popular father-figure role of demon hunter Bobby Singer on Supernatural (2005), a part that brought him a worldwide fan base and a secondary career making personal appearances. He was married to and had a daughter with Cecily Adams, the actress-casting director daughter of Get Smart (1965)'s Don Adams. Following her death from lung cancer in 2004, he wrote a best-selling memoir, \"Life's That Way.\" He has continued to write plays and, between acting jobs, to work on the George Reeves project, now planned as a book. He served as biographical consultant on Reeves for the semi-biopic Hollywoodland (2006).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIwMjExMzY2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxMDI0NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0064769","name":"Jim Beaver","idIMDB":"nm0064769"},"actorId":"nm0064769","character":"NSA Director Wisdom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jason Butler Harner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0124798","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1ODg0NjY0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAxNTk5MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 October 1970","placeOfBirth":" Elmira, New York, USA","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Jason Butler Harner was born on October 9, 1970 in Elmira, New York, USA.

Thus, communication and expression, both verbal and non-verbal, were explored during his formative years through dance, drama, poetry and travel. With over 100 episodes of television and film to his credit, Rahi has enjoyed recurring and guest starring roles on shows such as Scrubs as Dr. Wen, the attending surgeon, for 5 seasons, Chicago PD, Criminal Minds, Law and Order: LA, Crash, Castle, Bones, ER, the series finale of Everybody Loves Raymond, and feature films including Next with Nicolas Cage, The Brothers Solomon with Will Arnett and Will Forte, MI:3 with Tom Cruise and The Interview with Seth Rogen and James Franco. He also played Dr. Misra, the Chief Oncologist on General Hospital and Dr. Jerry Lee, the Chief Hematologist on The Young and the Restless, 6 months after which he was also cast as Y&R's chief plastic surgeon. Needless to say, his innate medical prowess should not be underestimated. Concurrently, Rahi has enjoyed training at spiritual and healing centers around the world including living and practicing Zen meditation in Japan, Vipassana meditation at Wat Ram Peung, Thailand, completing the Advanced Therapy Training at the Osho Meditation Resort in Pune, India, healing with John of God in Abadiania, Brazil, becoming certified in Family Constellation Therapy with Bert Hellinger in Austria, and engaging in treks through the mountains of Tibet, the Annapurna in Nepal, and the Golden Triangle along the Thai and Burmese borders. After completing an MA in Spiritual Psychology from the University of Santa Monica and becoming a CA state-certified Somatic Sex Educator, he founded Somatic Sexual Wholeness, combining developmental psychology, the safe and effective release of trauma from the nervous system, and sexological bodywork to restore and expand the body's natural capacity for presence, pleasure and wholeness.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NTM5NDI1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAzMjIzMDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0161130","name":"Charles Rahi Chun","nicknames":["Rahi"],"idIMDB":"nm0161130"},"actorId":"nm0161130","character":"Davis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0107794","main":true},{"actorName":"Patricia Prata","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2239339","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 February 1977","placeOfBirth":" Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","bio":"Born Patricia Dos Santos Guimaraes she was an artist since her birth.
