Born in Cologne, he served as a cadet in a Prussian military academy before finishing his matriculation. He then began to attend acting classes and studying art history in Berlin and Bonn, making his debut on the stage in 1909. After playing in theatres in towns and cities along the Rhine and northern Germany for nearly ten years, he started making films in 1919. His villainous roots first came to the fore in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), but he really established his reputation in a series of classic expressionist films written by his then-wife Thea von Harbou and directed by Fritz Lang. Of these, the most memorable were his forceful Moriarty-inspired portrayals of the titular character in Dr. Mabuse: The Gambler (1922), and its later sequel, Le testament du docteur Mabuse (1933). The latter, which has an evil mastermind directing his empire from a madhouse, was so obviously aimed at the Hitler regime, that it was banned by Joseph Goebbels. Klein-Rogge's other noteworthy appearances include King Etzel in Die Nibelungen: Siegfried (1924) and Les nibelungen, la vengeance de Kriemhild (1924); and his insane scientist C.A. Rothwang, creator of the robot creature in Fritz Lang's masterpiece Metropolis (1927). A powerful personality possessed of an almost hypnotic stare and a strong, resonant voice, Klein-Rogge continued on through the 1930's in supporting roles. However, the period of expressionist cinema in Germany had all but run its course and he died in relative obscurity in Graz, Austria, in April 1955.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1ODgzMzU3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ3ODMwMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0459030","name":"Rudolf Klein-Rogge","idIMDB":"nm0459030"},"actorId":"nm0459030","character":"Haghi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0495838","main":true},{"actorName":"Gerda Maurus","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0561276","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNmZDFkM2MtMWVjNy00OGM1LWI5Y2QtZWFkOTNjMGUxNTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 August 1903","placeOfBirth":" Breitenfurt, Lower Austria, Austria","birthName":"Gertrud Pfiel","bio":"Gertrud Pfiel was born in present day Croatia, the daughter of an engineer and inventor. A strikingly beautiful blonde with high cheekbones and expressive blue eyes, she grew up in Vienna where she was trained as a singer and dancer, embarking on a theatrical career by the age of fifteen. Until 1944, 'Gertraud' regularly performed at various theatres in Berlin, Hamburg and Vienna. During a performance, she came to the attention of the director Fritz Lang, who became instantly enamored with her. Without an audition, Lang gave her a starring role as a defecting Russian spy in Spies (1928), the success of which led to further back-to-back leads in Woman in the Moon (1929) and Treason (1929). Lang eventually left his wife and long-time collaborator, the screenwriter Thea von Harbou, while Gerda Maurus went onto marry another prolific director, Robert A. Stemmle, who directed her in Daphne and the Diplomat (1937). During the sound era, Gerda was intermittently given further opportunities to shine, including opposite Hans Albers (Dope (1932)) and Paul Hörbiger (Prinzessin Sissy (1939)), but she seemed somehow unable to repeat the success of her earlier (silent) films. Her association, however tenuous, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels tainted her career during the immediate post-war period. While her acting ban was eventually lifted, she rarely again graced the screen, but for several more years continued on as a stage actress in Munich and Düsseldorf.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNmZDFkM2MtMWVjNy00OGM1LWI5Y2QtZWFkOTNjMGUxNTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0561276","name":"Gerda Maurus","idIMDB":"nm0561276"},"actorId":"nm0561276","character":"Sonya Baranilkowa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lien Deyers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223372","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODYyMDczODdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDM1MzIxNTIx._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 November 1909","placeOfBirth":" Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands","bio":"Dutch actress Lien Deyers was discovered by the great German director Fritz Lang, who gave her a part in his film Spies (1928).

When the Nazis came to power, she and her Jewish husband left Germany for England. There she couldn't find work in the film business, so she and her husband went to the US to try their luck. In the US things went from bad to worse. Unable to find work in Hollywood, she was forced to take jobs outside the business. Her marriage to Zeisler eventually failed, and she took to the bottle to solve her problems. She soon became an alcoholic and had numerous run-ins with the law. She married and divorced a few times, but soon completely vanished from the public view. The last time she was heard from was in 1964, when she was in a Las Vegas (NV) jail. It is thought that she died shortly after that.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODYyMDczODdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDM1MzIxNTIx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223372","name":"Lien Deyers","idIMDB":"nm0223372"},"actorId":"nm0223372","character":"Kitty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Louis Ralph","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0707778","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 August 1884","placeOfBirth":" Graz, Styria, Austria-Hungary [now Austria]","birthName":"Ludwig Musik","bio":"Louis Ralph was born on August 17, 1884 in Graz, Styria, Austria-Hungary as Ludwig Musik.

At the age of 17 she ran away from the boarding school and went to an acting school in Leipzig. There she made first experiences as an extra at the theater and at the opera. She went to Max Reinhardt in Berlin one year later and with it she managed her breakthrough on the stage. Because she couldn't earn a fortune at the theater she also took on small well paid parts for movies. To her earliest performances belong \"Destinée\", \"Herzog Ferrantes Ende, \"Am Rande der Grossstadt\" and \"Tragödie der Liebe\", where she played together with Marlene Dietrich as an extra. Her first great movie success came in 1924 with \"Der Berg des Schicksals\", at Luis Trenker's side. She played for the first time for director Georg Wilhelm Pabst in the international successful production \"Die freudlose Gasse\". In the following years she acted under his direction time and again, so in the well-known movies \"Geheimnisse einer Seele, \"Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney\" and \"Abwege\". But also other directors like Friedrich Zelnik, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Richard Oswald, Paul Czinner and Fritz Lang esteemed the actress who was often called on for dubious roles. To her other well-known silent movies belong the worldwide success \"Faust\", \"Die Weber\", \"Svengali\", \"Dr. Bessels Verwandlung\", \"Spione\" and \"Die Ehe\". In the sound film era joined many other great movies her filmographie, among them \"Der Greifer\", Alfred Hitchcock's \"Murder - Mary/Sir John greift ein\", the classic \"M\", directed by Fritz Lang, \"Die Koffer des Herrn O.F.\" and \"Der Tiger von Eschnapur\". Her family insisted on not to play in movies during her short-lasting marriage with director Paul May. Therefore she only appeared again on the screen in 1938 with \"Sergeant Berry\" and \"Ich verweigere die Aussage\". In the war time she went on tour for troops care. When the Gestapo tried to sign her on as an agent she fled to Portugal, later to Brazil. There she lived together with her second husband in a mine area. She went back to Germany in 1960 and played at the theater at the present, later she also appeared in movies again. Her last movies were \"Jonathan\" , \"Das Schlangenei\" and \"Satan ist auf Gottes Seite\".","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0903189","name":"Hertha von Walther","idIMDB":"nm0903189"},"actorId":"nm0903189","character":"Lady Leslane","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lupu Pick","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0681726","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 January 1886","placeOfBirth":" Iasi, Iasi, Romania","birthName":"Lupu Ludwig Pick","bio":"Lupu Pick was born on January 2, 1886 in Iasi, Iasi, Romania as Lupu Ludwig Pick.
