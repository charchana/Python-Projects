Family escaped Berlin in 1933 and settled in Palestine where he grew up. In 1947 family migrated to the US, shortened their name to Jacobs and became naturalized citizens. Wolf, who became William Jacobs, was drafted in 1951 before becoming a citizen, and sent to the Korean front for all of 1952. Upon his discharge, he studied Drama at the Neighborhood Playhouse '53-'55 on the G.I.Bill. After graduation he was much involved in off-Broadway Theater and subsequently signed by theatrical agents, who had him change his professional name to William Sargent - which he later legalized. In 1960 he came to Hollywood for a minor film roll and stayed for the next 27 years working in T.V. and Theater. In 1987 he and his wife moved to Salt Lake City, where two years later, he opened a downtown Theater which ran for 4 seasons. He lives in Utah with his wife Patricia and their two cats - and now primarily does voice-overs.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0765095","name":"William Sargent","idIMDB":"nm0765095"},"actorId":"nm0765095","character":"Blacksmith","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ray Porter","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692255","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Ray Porter is an actor and casting director, known for Almost Famous (2000), Argo (2012) and The Runaways (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692255","name":"Ray Porter","idIMDB":"nm0692255"},"actorId":"nm0692255","character":"Jarom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ursel Allred","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3483550","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ursel Allred is an actor, known for The Animated Book of Mormon (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3483550","name":"Ursel Allred","idIMDB":"nm3483550"},"actorId":"nm3483550","character":"Eli / Believer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nathan Shipp","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3484295","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nathan Shipp is an actor, known for The Animated Book of Mormon (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3484295","name":"Nathan Shipp","idIMDB":"nm3484295"},"actorId":"nm3484295","character":"Young Nephi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Grey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3473591","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"David Grey is an actor, known for Animated Stories from the New Testament (1987) and The Animated Book of Mormon (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3473591","name":"David Grey","idIMDB":"nm3473591"},"actorId":"nm3473591","character":"Young Timothy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brian Nissen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1270819","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Brian Nissen is a writer and actor, known for The Swan Princess (1994), The Swan Princess: Escape from Castle Mountain (1997) and The King and I (1999).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1270819","name":"Brian Nissen","idIMDB":"nm1270819"},"actorId":"nm1270819","character":"Nephi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jared Davis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3448169","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jared Davis is an actor, known for Animated Stories from the New Testament (1987) and The Animated Book of Mormon (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3448169","name":"Jared Davis","idIMDB":"nm3448169"},"actorId":"nm3448169","character":"Lachoneus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael M.
