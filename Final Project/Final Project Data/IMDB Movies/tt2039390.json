He was raised in North Hollywood, California and then moved to small town San Marino with his mother, Jane, and his father Richard, a lawyer, and his older sister, Linda. Drawn to the creative arts from an early age, Gary fell in love with theatre, and it charted his course through high school and at UCLA. At college, he starred in student Shane Black's (Lethal Weapon) play It Never Rains, and soon after was working consistently in film and television throughout college. Gary soon broke through and was part of the all-star ensemble in groundbreaking series such as Twin Peaks (as Mike \"The Snake\" Nelson), and later in two seasons of Six Feet Under as the nefarious, guy-you-loved-to-hate Mr. Gilardi. One of his standout performances was playing the younger, college-aged Robert Redford character in the charming romp action film, Sneakers. Respected in the theatrical community, Gary studied with the late acclaimed acting teacher Peggy Feury of The Loft Studio, Matt Chait, several years with Candy Kaniecki, as well as three years at the top training ground for improvisational actors, the Groundling Theatre. Gary has a broad character range, playing leading men, nuanced villains, as well as a love for light comedy.

Gary has been blessed to work with Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning director Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams), Academy Award winner Alan Ball (American Beauty), multi-Oscar nominated, acclaimed director David Lynch (Twin Peaks), and has worked with such greats as Tom Hanks, Robert Redford, Naomi Watts, and many, many others. Over the last decade, Gary started his writing career by helping other writers shepherd their script into production, being a silent ghostwriter and guide. Gary is now an award-winning writer, having won a Top Ten Feature Finalist in the Final Draft Big Break Screenplay Contest (2012). His other awards include a PAGE International Screenwriting Award for Top Ten Finalist for Best Television Comedy, a PAGE Top Ten Finalist for Best Television Drama, and won third place for the PAGE Best Television Comedy.

In preparation for the production of the feature film, Gary produced and directed the short film version starring Zachary Levi (Tangled). Gary directed a thirty-five member cast, including coordinating all the sports action photography, shooting a twelve member real-life high school basketball team, and led an all-star production crew. Gary is looking forward to his directorial debut with Late in the Season, working with producer Jim Schmidt (Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius) and producer Darren Moorman, who recently finished Paramount Pictures' upcoming Same Kind of Different as Me, starring Greg Kinnear, Renee Zellweger, and Jon Voight. Gary is a member of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, SAG-AFTRA, and Actors' Equity Association.

His entire family hails from Brooklyn. His folks, Al and Flo, are gone, but he has a brother (Jay), a sister (Gayle), two nephews (John and Sam) and three nieces (Samara, Ilana and Maia). He graduated with a BA degree as a speech and theater major from Brooklyn College. He did not shine while in college, and was discouraged from continuing as an actor with the critique that he was \"hopeless and without any ability or talent\" (he continues to wonder if the faculty was right). He has been a bartender, an antique dealer, a boxer, an international drug trafficker, a fifth-grade teacher in the NYC public school system, a competitive body builder, a truck driver, a bouncer, a bagel maker, a short-order cook, a marathon runner, a designer, a competitive gymnast, a background extra, a disco dancer at the famed \"Arthur\" discotheque, and a confused and aimless layabout. Richard is 6'0\", weighs in at a trim 180 lb. and continues to box. He has excellent defensive skills and his ability to stop punches with his face has made him a local favorite. Portnow assayed the role of attorney Hal \"Mel\" Melvoin on the Emmy-winning HBO series The Sopranos (1999), the lawyer for Uncle Junior, whom he singlehandedly kept out of prison and managed to get placed under house arrest instead. His rates for defending Corrado Soprano (Uncle Juniors's full name) are astronomical, but as Uncle June has said, \"Mel, you're worth every penny\". He has held this role since the show's inception in 1999. Richard began his professional career at the famed Cafe La Mama in New York City, appearing in plays by Tom Eyen, Leonard Melfi, Jeff Weiss, Megan Terry, Tom O'Horgan and Lanford Wilson. He won \"The Best Newcomer of the Year\" award from Show Business Magazine as a result of his early work off-off-Broadway. He continued his stage career with starring roles on Broadway in \"The House of Blue Leaves\" and \"A Month of Sundays\". He was in the original cast of \"Moonchildren\" at the prestigious Royal Court Theatre in London. He has also worked extensively at some of the most highly regarded regional theaters in the country, including The Long Wharf Theater, The Berkshire Theatre Festival for the brilliant director Josephine Abady, The Philadelphia Drama Guild, The Lowell Regional Theater and the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park. Neil Simon's \"Oscar and Felix\" at The Geffen Playhouse marked Richard's Los Angeles stage debut. His has also appeared in Woody Allen's \"Writer's Block\", which was directed by Allen at The Atlantic Theater Company in New York. Richard has been fortunate and privileged to work with some of the best directors in film today. Among those who have had a profound influence on him are Barry Levinson, Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, David Fincher, Woody Allen, Sydney Pollack, James Foley, Jim Jarmusch, Heywood Gould, Cameron Crowe and Sidney Lumet. He has also appeared as a regular on the critically acclaimed series EZ Streets (1996) and on the police drama Ryan Caulfield: Year One (1999).
