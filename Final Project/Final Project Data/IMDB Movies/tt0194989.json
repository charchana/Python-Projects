It was in Tucson, Arizona, that his grandmother gave him his first acoustic guitar, a gift that would prove an icebreaker when meeting other students at the many new schools in which he was placed. After settling with his family in Fort Worth, Texas, Denver ran away to California for a short time. He returned to Texas and graduated from high school, but soon returned to California on a more permanent basis. He began performing at Leadbetter's night club in West Los Angeles but had a major career breakthrough when he was selected to replace the departing Chad Mitchell of The Chad Mitchell Trio. He remained with that organization until 1968 when he struck out on his own. From 1969 through 1975, Denver was the top-selling recording artist, appearing on both country and pop charts alike. His peak year was 1975, during which he was awarded the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year in addition to being selected as the American Guild of Variety Artists' Singing Star of the Year. During this period, he tried his hand at acting, appearing as Deputy Dewey Cobb in a 1973 episode of McCloud (1970) and hosting Day of the Bighorn (1974), an ecologically-minded television special. His most memorable role came in 1977 when he starred opposite George Burns in the hit comedy, Oh, God! (1977). Following this, his record sales began to decline, and he made fewer movies and television specials. He became something of a political activist, with his main focus being on environmental issues. He was killed on Sunday, October 12th, 1997, (505 years after Christopher Columbus' discovery of North America) when the plane he was piloting crashed into Monterey Bay. John Denver's lifetime: 19,616 days (2,802 weeks & 2 days).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNjM1MDczMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY4ODAzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000135","name":"John Denver","idIMDB":"nm0000135"},"actorId":"nm0000135","character":"Himself - Host","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Frank Oz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000568","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NTM4ODA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMxMjQ0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1944","placeOfBirth":" Hereford, England, UK","birthName":"Frank Richard Oznowicz","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Frank Richard Oznowicz was born in Hereford, England to puppeteers Frances and Isidore Oznowicz. His family moved to Montana in 1951, eventually settling in Oakland, California. As a teenager, he worked as an apprentice puppeteer at Children's Fairyland amusement park. He is one of the primary puppeteers responsible for the development of Jim Henson's Sesame Street (1969) and _\"The Muppet Show\" (1976)_ as well as over 75 other Muppet productions. 'George Lucas' originally contacted Henson to play the part of Yoda in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), but he recommended Oz for the part instead. He developed the character's trademark syntax, returning to voice and puppet the Jedi Master in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). He voiced the CGI character in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005), supporting the transition of the character's rendering to digital. In 2011, the Blu-Ray edition of The Phantom Menace replaced the puppet Yoda with CGI to match the other prequel films. He began a career of behind-the-camera puppet and live action filmmaking by co-directing The Dark Crystal (1982) with Henson. He went on to direct The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), What About Bob? (1991), The Indian in the Cupboard (1995), Bowfinger (1999), The Score (2001), The Stepford Wives (2004) and Death at a Funeral (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NTM4ODA0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODMxMjQ0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000568","name":"Frank Oz","idIMDB":"nm0000568"},"actorId":"nm0000568","character":"Fozzie Bear / Miss Piggy / Animal / Sam the Eagle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000530","main":true},{"actorName":"Jerry Nelson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0625456","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1NjEzNjU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxOTEzOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 July 1934","placeOfBirth":" Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","bio":"Puppeteer, actor, musician, and master of voices, Jerry Nelson originally joined Henson & Company as a temporary replacement for Frank Oz, who had been drafted into the armed services in the 60's.

The vehicle that achieved it was Sam and Friends (1955), a late-night puppet show that was on after the 11:00 news in Washington DC. It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn't need to hide puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets and television would lead to separate projects that had different goals. The first one was his work on the The Jimmy Dean Show (1963) with the character Rowlf the Dog, the oldest clearly identified character that Henson Productions still uses. This show provided an income that allowed Jim to work on a pet project. That project was Time Piece (1965), a surrealistic short about time which was nominated for best live-action short Oscar. Henson shot to prominence when he was approached to use his muppets for the revolutionary educational show Sesame Street (1969). The show was a smash hit and his characters have become staples on public television. Unforetunately, this also led to Henson being typecast as only an entertainer for children. He sought to disprove that by being part of the initial crew of Saturday Night Live (1975), but his style and that of the creative staff simply didn't jibe. It was this circumstance that encouraged him to develop a variety show format that had the kind of sophisticated humor that \"Sesame Street (1969)\" didn't work with. No American broadcaster was interested, but British producer Lew Grade was. This led to The Muppet Show (1976). It initially struggled both in the ratings and in the search for guest stars, but in the second season it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made The Muppet Movie (1979), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie. The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy The Dark Crystal (1982), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work. The most successful TV work in the 1980s was Fraggle Rock (1983), a fantasy series specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible. During this time he also established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects. When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant The Storyteller (1987) series respectively attest to.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMzI3MjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIzMDk1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001345","name":"Jim Henson","idIMDB":"nm0001345"},"actorId":"nm0001345","character":"Kermit the Frog / Rowlf / Waldorf / Dr. Teeth / The Swedish Chef","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000604","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Whitmire","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0926209","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNDM3NzE0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4MDAyNzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 September 1958","placeOfBirth":" Atlanta, Georgia, USA","birthName":"Steven Lawrence Whitmire","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Steve Whitmire was born on September 24, 1958 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA as Steven Lawrence Whitmire.

A four-time Emmy Award-winner and Jim Henson Protege, Michael performed the original \"Shrek\" character in a motion-capture development test film for DreamWorks, and puppeteered lead characters in Paramount Pictures' \"Team America\" - the all-marionette feature written and directed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park. He is the co-creator, writer, lyricist and puppet star of PBS' \"Ticktock Minutes\" - winner of 12 Emmys, two Parents' Choice Awards and numerous other honors. Earl began his professional career at age five acting in a Curad Bandaid TV commercial. Two years later he was tapped to be the original \"Is It Soup Yet?\" kid for Lipton. The spot ran for three years, the first in a series of wildly popular commercials that over the next decade became one of the most successful ad campaigns in history. Michael's other childhood interests included music and magic, but his passion for puppetry is what propelled him toward his emerging goals. At 18, Michael moved from his hometown of Livermore, California to New York City where he quickly landed a job working for world-renowned puppetry pioneer Bil Baird, creator of the marionettes for the movie \"The Sound of Music.\" At 19, Michael won the role of Mr. Snuffle-upagus on \"Sesame Street\" (replacing Jerry Nelson, the originator, 1978-81, Seasons 10, 11 & 12) also creating the roles of Forgetful Jones and many others. Oscar the Grouch's pet worm Slimey, Poco Loco, Polly Darton and the Honkers are among his dozens of Muppet characters still seen and enjoyed by millions of children daily. His other Muppet credits include \"The Muppet Movie,\" \"The Muppets Take Manhattan,\" \"John Denver & The Muppets,\" \"Little Muppet Monsters,\" \"The Jim Henson Hour,\" \"The 30th Anniversary Muppet Special,\" \"Sesame Street's 20th Anniversary Special\" and \"Dinosaurs.\" He also appeared (as a puppet Alien) opposite Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in \"Men In Black II.\" A New York-trained actor/singer/dancer, he has appeared in and/or sung on numerous television commercials (M&M's, Pepsi, Crest, Kit Kat, Planter's, Fandango, etc...), movies, stage and TV shows. He has acted with Whoopi Goldberg, danced with Gregory Hines and clowned with Victor Borge. For the Broadway stage, Michael created the role of Noel Petard in Sid & Marty Krofft's critically acclaimed \"A Broadway Baby.\" His other stage work includes Audrey II in \"Little Shop of Horrors\" (\"You'll marvel at Earl's skill!\" - LA Times) and his 1998 biographical musical one-man show \"Pure Imagination!,\" which he wrote and performed in Los Angeles and New York to much acclaim. Michael is a seven-time Emmy nominee and in 1995, won his first Emmy Award for his performance as Dr. Ticktock in \"Ticktock Minutes,\" produced by Mississippi Educational Television. In subsequent years he was awarded three more Southern Regional Emmys for his lyric writing (in collaboration with composer Randy Klein) on the PBS interstitials, which are currently distributed on CD and DVD by BMG Music. Earl has mentored and/or coached many of today's most successful TV and film puppeteers. He has served as a puppetry consultant to such entertainment companies as MCA/Universal, Warner Bros. and Disney, working one-on-one with the Vice President of Disneyland Entertainment to conceive, develop and write puppet- and non-puppet live events. He has toured the U.S. giving concerts for children and their families, combining his talents as a singer, songwriter and puppeteer. In 1997 he created, wrote, co-produced and performed five educational puppet videos for City of Hope National Medical Center which are currently being used by pediatric nurses to help prepare young cancer patients for treatment. Over the years, he has worked one-on-one with countless children and adults, teaching them puppet making and performance through such organizations as the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, Mark Taper Forum/Music Center, Kaiser, California Youth Theatre, L.A.'s Best, Puppeteers of America, L.A. Inner City Arts, Beverly Hills Parks & Recreation, The Sycamores, L.A. Unified School District, Art Share L.A., Hollywood Arts Council and the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission. In 2002, Michael created the \"Puppet Power!\" program through California Youth Theatre, where he taught, built, directed and produced the first annual Ivar Puppet Festival, involving 150 L.A. Unified School District teens from two different high schools building dozens of giant 15-foot puppets they performed at the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood. The event was a sold-out success and covered by the L.A. Times and the L.A. Daily News. Michael Earl lives in Los Angeles where he teaches an on-camera course in TV puppetry. He is also creating new TV, film and theatre entertainments designed to perpetuate the spread of wonder in the world...as well as encourage, instruct and strengthen children of all ages through the imaginative use of music and puppetry.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0205174","name":"Michael Earl","idIMDB":"nm0205174"},"actorId":"nm0205174","character":"Muppet Performer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0302338","main":true},{"actorName":"Cheryl Henson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378193","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 August 1961","placeOfBirth":" USA","birthName":"Cheryl Lee Henson","bio":"Cheryl Henson was born on August 7, 1961 in the USA as Cheryl Lee Henson.
