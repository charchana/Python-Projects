What is often forgotten is that Bobby Riggs was at one point the number 1 tennis player in the world and a former Wimbledon and United States Champion. He was reputed to have bet on myself to win the singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles in the 1939 Wimbledon. The story goes that if he won all 3 titles that he would win $108,000. It is the part of the Rigg's mythology and may or may not be true. What is definitely true is that he did win the singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1939 making him one of the few players to ever complete this prestigous triple. Riggs became a pro in the early 1940s and became the number 1 player in the world by defeating Don Budge 23 matches to 21 in 1946. Riggs remained number 1 until he was decisively defeated by Jack Kramer in the tour of 1947-1948 by a score of 69 matches to 20.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0726677","name":"Bobby Riggs","idIMDB":"nm0726677"},"actorId":"nm0726677","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt3828490","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3828490","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":null,"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.7","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"12","type":"TV Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 18:10:20"}}
