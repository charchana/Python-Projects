Being a student of Philosophy at the age of 25 he realized his dedication goes out to theatre play and music. He was born Oscar Luis Manuel Pallares Foronda on September 13, 1970, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, as the younger of four brothers. As a young child, Foronda regularly was taken to the movie theaters by his father, along with his three older brothers. Quite early in life he developed a passion for film and theatre after seeing the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" at the age of 12. Foronda was a sportive youngster and with 16 the Spanish karate kid winning first titles in martial arts in the State of Catalonia. He defeats the bullies, wins the attention of the audiences and becomes a respected and professional body-builder. Foronda competes successfully until the age of 23, albeit his sports career ends when he starts theater playing. Foronda began his acting right into the field and taking some courses while working in all kind of jobs in Spain and made his acting debut at a small theatre company called Cercle d'Or. With this small theatre he gave performances in small town theaters and on the street. IN 1999 he started working as an actor for the Theatre Del Liceu in Barcelona and afterwards also in Teatro Real in Madrid, becoming one of the most wanted members of both Theatres. Many famous Theatre directors were in great demand for staging Operas in need of specific actor roles. Foronda had the privilege of working with singers such as Jose Carreras, Montserrat Caballe, Placido Domingo, Natalie Dessai, Edita Gruverova. He also worked abroad, in theater Bolshoi of Moscow along with Sir Williard White. Foronda's stage performances caught the attention of film director Tono Errando, who cast the actor in his film debut La Gran mentira del rock'n'roll (2002). It was Forondas first role in a movie. The same year Foronda played the character of Macduff in Macbeth as theatre play, directed by Calixto Bieito. The performances lasted 1 ½ years and ended up in the famed theatre of Barbican in London, former location of the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2003 Foronda made his debut in a first TV series \"El Comisario\". He played a lover who ended up being eradicated by his girlfriend. After these TV series Foronda frequently stared in many renowned Spanish and foreign TV series, such as Hospital Central, Porca misèria, or Hispania. One of his first English speaking roles was in 2010 in the British TV series \"Any Human Heart\", directed by Michael Samuels. Foronda plays a Lieutenant. Foronda established himself as a nationally known Latin heartthrob with charming expressions. Outside of his acting profession, Foronda has been a passionate music fan and a loyal supporter of the FC Barcelona Football Club.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MDk5NTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY1ODYyNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2393147","name":"Oscar Foronda","nicknames":["Fondi"],"idIMDB":"nm2393147"},"actorId":"nm2393147","character":" Suboficial falangista","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Anna Zouari","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007433","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Anna Zouari is an actress, known for El hombre intermitente (2012) and Tornarem (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007433","name":"Anna Zouari","idIMDB":"nm5007433"},"actorId":"nm5007433","character":" Cantant cabaret","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gerard Romagosa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007338","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Gerard Romagosa is an actor, known for Tornarem (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007338","name":"Gerard Romagosa","idIMDB":"nm5007338"},"actorId":"nm5007338","character":" Homes Halftrack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sergi Treserres","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007351","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Sergi Treserres is an actor, known for Tornarem (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007351","name":"Sergi Treserres","idIMDB":"nm5007351"},"actorId":"nm5007351","character":" Homes Halftrack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Sergio Vargas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007339","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Sergio Vargas is an actor, known for Tornarem (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007339","name":"Sergio Vargas","idIMDB":"nm5007339"},"actorId":"nm5007339","character":" Homes Halftrack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Javier Gómez","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007424","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Javier Gómez is an actor, known for El bosc (2012) and Tornarem (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007424","name":"Javier Gómez","idIMDB":"nm5007424"},"actorId":"nm5007424","character":" Homes Halftrack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Albert Honorato","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007357","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Albert Honorato is an actor, known for Tornarem (2012).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5007357","name":"Albert Honorato","idIMDB":"nm5007357"},"actorId":"nm5007357","character":" Homes Halftrack","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Albert Lladó","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4480213","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Albert Lladó is an actor and producer, known for La Cartera (2012), InfluencersTV (2017) and ...Mayombe, Paula?.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4480213","name":"Albert Lladó","idIMDB":"nm4480213"},"actorId":"nm4480213","character":" Soldat republicà","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[{"yearSeason":2012,"episodes":[{"episode":1,"title":"Episode #1.1","date":"16 Apr. 2012","plot":"Know what this is about?
