He was given the name Bam at age three, by his grandfather, after his habit of running into walls. He is of Italian (from his paternal grandfather), German, English, and Welsh descent. In high school, he'd often appear in articles in Jeff Tremaine's Big Brother magazine and made CKY videos with his older brother Jess and his friends Chris Raab, Ryan Dunn, and Brandon DiCamillo. He only attended high school because Chris Raab went. Bam dropped out of high school after Chris Raab got suspended for smearing feces on lockers, but his parents persuaded him to get his GED which he got. In 2000, Jeff Tremaine made a deal with MTV to make a show called Jackass and Bam got a spot on the show. Even though Jackass lasted two years, Margera would go on to star in the Jackass movies and even have his own reality television series, Viva La Bam featuring his family and CKY members including Jackass star and close friend Ryan Dunn. Over the years, he starred in other Jackass films and other skateboarding projects. In 2011, he lost his best friend Ryan Dunn from a drunk-driving accident. He now has his own game show, Bam's Badass Gameshow.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNDg1NjAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTgwMzgyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0546640","name":"Bam Margera","nicknames":["Bam Bam"],"idIMDB":"nm0546640"},"actorId":"nm0546640","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Preston Lacy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1035634","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDc4MzE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU3NjYyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 August 1969","placeOfBirth":" Carthage, Missouri, USA","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Preston Lacy was born on August 14, 1969 in Carthage, Missouri, USA.

So he went back home to Albuquerque, New Mexico to film himself doing dangerous and stupid stunts for submission to skateboarding companies. Steve-O's relationship with Big Brother Magazine began in 1997 when they ran a side-bar article about him catching his face on fire when their Big Brother tour came through Albuquerque. In 1999 he moved from New Mexico to Florida. For six months he worked as a performer on Royal Carribean Cruise Lines and was then offered a job at the Hanneford Family Circus as a clown. During this time he was featured in several more issues of Big Brother Magazine and even filmed a part for the Big Brother video \"Boob\". This is when he became involved with Jackass.

After attending Washington University, Tremaine headed out West, where he slid into the layout jockey position at Go magazine. From there, he became the art/editorial director for Big Brother. At the magazine, Tremaine, Spike Jonze, and Johnny Knoxville laid the seeds for jackass, a television series that would become a cultural phenomenon, spawning a franchise that includes jackass: the movie, jackass number two, jackass 2.5, and jackass 3D, which Paramount Pictures released in October 2010. Beyond jackass, Tremaine has created and executive produced a number of television series' including MTV's Wildboyz, Rob & Big, Nitro Circus, Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory, Dudesons in America, and the new series, Ridiculousness. In 2009, he produced Steve-O: Demise and Rise, an MTV documentary about addiction and the road to recovery.
