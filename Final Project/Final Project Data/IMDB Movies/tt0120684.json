He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his sister Jean to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theater, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by William Shakespeare, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre. When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theater festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Laurence Olivier, Wendy Hiller, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Paul Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest. McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher's \"section 28\" legislation which would make the \"public promotion of homosexuality\" a crime. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand, and he has been active in the Gay Rights movement ever since. Ian resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in acclaimed stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received Richard III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Apt Pupil (1998) and Gods and Monsters (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps on 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as _King Lear (2008)_ directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and Noël Coward's \"Present Laughter\", as well as Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" and Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\", both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias. McKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in X-Men (2000) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, which he reprised in The Hobbit trilogy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjgyNjk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA3NTY5Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005212","name":"Ian McKellen","idIMDB":"nm0005212"},"actorId":"nm0005212","character":"James Whale","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014826","main":true},{"actorName":"Brendan Fraser","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000409","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MjExMzY0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMxOTg4MTI@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 December 1968","placeOfBirth":" Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","birthName":"Brendan James Fraser","height":"6' 3\" (1.91 m)","bio":"Brendan James Fraser was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Canadian parents Carol Mary (Genereux), a sales counselor, and Peter Fraser, a journalist and travel executive.

After graduation he found a minor role as Sailor #1 in River Phoenix's Dogfight (1991), then somewhat more substantial roles in Encino Man (1992) and School Ties (1992). He expresses a preference for playing \"fish out of water\" men. Five more years of supporting work led finally to the title role in George of the Jungle (1997), a role which fully utilized his charm and beefy good looks, as well as offering him a chance to show off his comic talents.

As the daughter of Rachel Kempson and Sir Michael Redgrave, sister of Vanessa Redgrave and Corin Redgrave, and granddaughter of Roy Redgrave and Margaret Scudamore, all of whom were actors, her early aspirations were surprisingly to become an equestrienne or a chef. It was not until the age of 15 that she became more and more involved in acting and her father's stage performances. Attending London's Central School of Music and Drama, she made her stage debut in 1962 and began film work a year later. It wasn't until her lovable role as the ugly-duckling in Georgy Girl (1966), that she was taken notice and, as a result, won both the Golden Globe, New York Film Critics Circle Award and a nomination for the coveted Best Actress at the 1967 Academy Awards. Despite this promising performance, Lynn struggled to find promising follow-up work, she played the lead in the fluffy Smashing Time (1967) and The Virgin Soldiers (1969), low-key films that were relevant at the time of London's swinging 60s, but very quickly became largely forgotten. She married stage actor/director John Clark and her sister, Vanessa Redgrave, who was also Oscar-nominated the same year for Morgan! (1966), was also gaining exposure and critical success if not surpassing Lynn, on both the British stage and films and was largely considered the leading face of England's breakout actresses of the '60s alongside 'Julie Christie' and other high-profile actresses. Becoming the label of Vanessa Redgrave's younger and chubbier sister \"that did that film a few years ago\" didn't sit well with Lynn and, as a result, she lost considerable weight and permanently settled in the U.S. in 1974 to distance herself from this. Primarily based in southern California, she regularly commuted to New York and became notable particularly on the Broadway stage, and had successful runs in \"Black Comedy/White Lies\" (1967), \"My Fat Friend\" (1974), \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\" (1976), \"Knock Knock\" (1976), \"Saint Joan\" (1977-1978), \"Aren't We All\" (1985) and \"Sweet Sue\" (1987). She was prolifically hired by major networks to appear on a variety of TV talk and game shows and held the position of co-host for a few seasons of Not for Women Only (1968), while acting on prime-time TV, whether it was guest spots, mini-series or short-lived TV series. For over 20 years, Redgrave's film career was infrequent and admittedly \"terrible\" by the actress herself, she notoriously played the title character in the critically-bashed, The Happy Hooker (1975), and the all-star cast misfire, The Big Bus (1976), and, in the 1980s, she focused in a different direction, becoming a spokesperson and commercial actress for \"Weight Watches\". This coincided with the release of her well- received book: \"This Is Living: How I Found Health and Happiness\", that detailed her weight issues and eating binges, it was also revealed that for years she suffered bulimia. In the mid-to-late '90s, Redgrave had somewhat of a resurgence in her career, from 1993-1994, she spent over 8 months on Broadway, as well as touring across the world, performing her own personally written show of \"Shakespeare for My Father\", that explored the bisexuality, aloof persona and intimidating resume of her father. In 1996, Scott Hicks reignited her film career after many years of inactivity by casting her in the Australian Oscar-winning hit, Shine (1996), in which she gave a short yet tender performance as \"Gillian\", the woman Geoffrey Rush's character falls in love with. Another Golden Globe win/Oscar nomination followed (this time in the supporting category) for her role as the Hungarian housekeeper in Gods and Monsters (1998). Her marriage abruptly ended in 1999, when infidelity was discovered on her husband's behalf and a nasty divorced followed, they produced three children Benjamin, Kelly Clark and Annabel Clark. Continually working her way through film, television and stage performances in the '00s, recently awarded the OBE, Lynn Redgrave was shocked to discover lumps on her body and was diagnosed with breast cancer. As a result, she took time to write \"Journal: A Mother and Daughter's Recovery from Breast Cancer\" with her youngest daughter, Annabel Clark, in 2003 and tragically lost her 7-year battle on 2 May 2010 (aged 67) in her family home, surrounded by her loved ones. Her diagnosis led her to realize the beauty and simplicities of life, and she was quoted as saying: \"there isn't any such thing as a bad day. Yes, bad things happen. But any day that I'm still here, able to feel and think and share things with people, then how could that possibly be a bad day?\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1NjEwMzIxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUwNzAzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001655","name":"Lynn Redgrave","idIMDB":"nm0001655"},"actorId":"nm0001655","character":"Hanna","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0151765","main":true},{"actorName":"Lolita Davidovich","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000357","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3ODY2NTcwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQ2ODcz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 July 1961","placeOfBirth":" London, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Lolita Davidovic","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Lolita Davidovich was born on July 15, 1961 in London, Ontario, Canada as Lolita Davidovic.

He first professional job came in 1991 when he was in a local theater production of \"Evita\". That winter, he went on to portray \"Tiny Tim\" in \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"Jacob Rothchild\" in \"The Rothchilds.\" He soon signed with The Christensen Group talent agency in Winter Park, Florida. From then on, he worked regularly at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando on such projects as the pilot episode of \"Gullah Gullah Island\", \"Nick News\", and \"All That.\" He landed his first film role in the 1995 hit NOW AND THEN, starring Demi Moore, where Brandon plays \"Bobby Fricker, \" a character that was originally dropped from the script but later restored just for him. While filming NOW AND THEN in Savannah, Brandon worked with Christina Ricci, Gaby Hoffmann, Thora Birch & Ashleigh Aston Moore. A few months after filming NOW AND THEN, Brandon auditioned for CHILDREN OF THE CORN - MILLENNIUM'S CHILD. Soon after he auditioned, he found himself flying to Austin, Texas for production. In the film, which is now known as CHILDREN OF THE CORN - THE GATHERING, Brandon plays the very demon that Stephen King originally created in his short story. In this film, Brandon worked with the legendary Karen Black, Naomi Watts (Tank Girl), Samaria Graham (NOTHING TO LOSE), Brent Jennings (ANOTHER 48 HRS.) and William Windom. During filming, Brandon was turned over to the artists at Sota FX, who transformed him into \"Josiah\", the amazing boy preacher who is wrongfully murdered by the townspeople. After CHILDREN OF THE CORN - THE GATHERING, Brandon and his family moved to Los Angeles where he contacted Roy Knyrim at Sota FX, the studio that did his makeup in \"Corn\" and started helping out around the shop. He soon was auditioning for casting director Valorie Massalas for the film FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN (later retitled GODS AND MONSTERS) -- by coincidence Sota FX was working on makeup effects for the film. Brandon went into his audition not knowing that Valorie Massalas was also one of the casting directors for one of his favorite films of all time, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE. Brandon says \"If I had known that when I went in, I probably would have made a real fool of myself.\" He went on to land the role of \"young James Whale, \" in GODS AND MONSTERS. During the filming of GODS AND MONSTERS, Brandon certainly did is part and more to help with the production. In addition to playing the \"young James Whale, \" he helped Sota FX with makeup. Very soon after wrapping production on GODS AND MONSTERS, he was on his way to the El Rey Theater on Wilshire Blvd. in Los Angeles to help out his friends Robert Bayer Burnett and Mark A. Altman, by doing a small cameo in their film FREE ENTERPRISE starring William Shatner.
