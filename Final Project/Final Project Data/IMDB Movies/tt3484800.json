When Meg Hamilton, wife, mother and renovation expert first loses her London team after an accident, then a local Yorkshire team too superstitious to continue, she's forced to carry on alone. The discovery of a secret attic room, a Rosicrucian mosaic, a bricked up root cellar and many other unexplainable events gradually convince Meg, her husband Alec and children Penny and Harper, that they're not only restoring the house, but also its original Victorian owners who died 150 years ago. But before they can escape, the house - and its former occupants - force them to spend one last, terrifying night under its roof.","simplePlot":"A young family move to an isolated house which the wife has been hired to restore, only to discover that the previous owner is reputed to have murdered his wife.","actors":[{"actorName":"Olivia Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931404","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MzczNjQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1MzIzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 July 1968","placeOfBirth":" Camden Town, London, England, UK","birthName":"Olivia Haigh Williams","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Olivia Williams was born July 26, 1968 in Camden Town, London.
