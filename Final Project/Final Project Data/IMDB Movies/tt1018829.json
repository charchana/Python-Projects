He knew by the age of 10 that he wanted to be an actor. After a dozen of plays before the age of 15 he knew that he would have to move to Hollywood. Almost soon after graduating from high school, he headed to Hollywood.

He honed his craft through various classes and workshops and ultimately found work on his own. Davis humbly considers his job on set working craft service to be the moment he started his career, and appreciates every day he has on set.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7265512","name":"Giovanni Davis","idIMDB":"nm7265512"},"actorId":"nm7265512","character":"Partier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Paula DeAnda","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2359149","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1NjIxNDQzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMzMjc1MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 November 1989","placeOfBirth":" San Angelo, Texas, USA","birthName":"Paula Dacia DeAnda","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Paula DeAnda was born on November 3, 1989 in San Angelo, Texas, USA as Paula Dacia DeAnda.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1NjIxNDQzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMzMjc1MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2359149","name":"Paula DeAnda","nicknames":["Pauly"],"idIMDB":"nm2359149"},"actorId":"nm2359149","character":"Alicia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nikki Flores","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2691956","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 October 1988","placeOfBirth":" California, USA","bio":"Nikki Flores was born on October 17, 1988 in California, USA.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2691956","name":"Nikki Flores","idIMDB":"nm2691956"},"actorId":"nm2691956","character":"Zoey Cortez","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brandon G.

His parents are both pastors, and his maternal grandfather was a Pentecostal child preacher. He credits his sense of humor to both his father and his life straddling the fence between suburbia and the inner city. Brandon held the title of \"class clown\" and grew his passion for comedy and acting by doing talent shows and performing at youth nights at his father's church. By age 14, Brandon's career as a stand-up comic evolved from local school shows and community projects, such as the \"Motor City Youth Festival\", to an appearance in Marc Cayce's film, Nikita Blues (2001). Brandon took an internship at local Detroit radio station 93.1 FM and soon found himself as a guest host at 105.9 FM. Brandon's drive took him to Hollywood where, in 2001, he was cast as an extra in major movies such as Ali (2001), Bowling for Columbine (2002) and 8 Mile (2002). He began to get calls to open up and work with comedians, such as Chris Tucker and Wayne Brady. After Brandon's performances at New York City's \"Showtime at the Apollo\" and BET's Comicview (1992), the 19-year-old actor/comedian was cast in his first major movie role as Shad Moss's (X) best friend, \"Junior\", in Roll Bounce (2005). He won Black Reel's 2006 Best Breakthrough Performance award for his performance. Jackson starred opposite NBA basketball superstar Kevin Durant in Thunderstruck (2012) and'Martin Lawrence (I)' in the third incarnation of the highly profitable Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son (2011) franchise released by Fox in 2011. He played Lawrence's son and the two went undercover to solve a murder. Jackson is perhaps best known as Alpha Chino from the high- concept runaway hit Tropic Thunder (2008). Jackson received rave reviews for his role as the satyr Grover Underwood, the best friend and protector of Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010), opposite Logan Lerman and Alexandra Daddario. Brandon co-starred in both Hulu's original series Deadbeat(2014) and Showtimes's _Californication (2008) (V)_.
