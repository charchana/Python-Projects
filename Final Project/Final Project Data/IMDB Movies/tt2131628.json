He quit school went to Rome and worked for several month as a shoeshine boy in a shoe-store. Nevertheless, he spent most of his time in the cinema watching movies. Back in Germany he joined different independent actor ensembles, touring the Repuplic of Germany, Austria and Switzerland whilst working as a prop master, light-tone technician, scene painter. He went to Paris for a while and lived in an artist commune. In 1986 Michael Cacoyannis (Alexis Sorbas) discovered him in the actor's canteen at the Staedtischen Buehnen Frankfurt, instructed him and immediately gave him a part in his opera production of Iphigenia. This special experience led to the decision to become an actor and a time of education to many different places followed. Since then he works as an actor for cinema, TV and theatre and also lent his voice to commercials and to famous characters (Conan, Sherlock Holmes, Cars, Pirates of the Caribbean...) for computer-games in Germany. In his free time, he writes short story's, sketches unusable furniture, works as a sculptor and painter and improves upon his English, French and Italian language skills.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4OTc0Mzk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE5NzkwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1311821","name":"Richard van Weyden","idIMDB":"nm1311821"},"actorId":"nm1311821","character":"Elisabeths Vater","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2131628","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2131628","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"19","month":"03","year":"2013","remarks":null},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"02","month":"05","year":"2013","remarks":null}],"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 29 min (89 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.9","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany"}],"awards":[],"votes":"309","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0074863","name":"Constantin Film Produktion"},{"idCompany":"co0002257","name":"Constantin Film"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["neurotic","psychotherapy","grief","guilt complex","breasts","exploding car","collapsing house","little girl","brushing teeth","nipples","female rear nudity","bathtub","male rear nudity","bare chested male","lesbian kiss","female nudity","threesome","prostitute","brothel","sex shop","dildo","sex toy","sex standing up","sex talk","rear entry sex","loss of sister","loss of brother","loss of sibling","stepfather stepdaughter relationship","loss of loved one","mother daughter relationship","husband wife relationship","therapist client relationship","car crash","singing in a car","one word title"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 00:41:39"}}
