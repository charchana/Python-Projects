Working and building up his trade at the Paris Music Hall in the early years, he appeared in small movie roles thoughout most of the 60s. In the 70s, however, he aimed his genius directly towards film and succeeded beyond the wildest expectations. Directing and co-writing many of his slapstick vehicles, his characters often have taken on an hilariously guileless persona and, coupled with his innate gift for klutzy physical comedy, have become an audience favorite for nearly four decades. His superior work in The Daydreamer (1970) and The Troubles of Alfred (1972) was immediately recognized and this led to the international crossover hit The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1973) in which Richard played a naive, innocent concert musician plucked by chance to become a superspy on a top secret mission. A potent association in the 1960s and 1970s with actor/producer/director Yves Robert and the 1980s with writer/director Francis Veber and actor Gerard Depardieu produced several comedy classics: Alexander (1967), The Return of the Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1974), The Goat (1981), Les Comperes (1983) and The Fugitives (1986). Many of Richard's classic comedies, including The Toy (1976), have spawned Hollywood remakes and imitations, though most pale compared to the originals.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MTEyMjU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMzU0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007069","name":"Pierre Richard","idIMDB":"nm0007069"},"actorId":"nm0007069","character":"François Perrin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0027590","main":true},{"actorName":"Bernard Blier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088396","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2OTcxMTg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI3MzI1NTE@._V1_UY44_CR18,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 January 1916","placeOfBirth":" Buenos Aires, Argentina","bio":"Bernard Blier was born on January 11, 1916 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Born in 1930, he trained at the Paris Conservatoire but had to halt his studies due to military service. Relocating to Paris, he developed a minor name for himself in cabaret and stage plays. He also worked with the Grenier-Hussenot company at this time and acted in TV drama. Throughout his career Rochefort would return sporadically to the theatre as both actor and director. Films took his immediate focus in the late 50s and he became an audience favorite in roguish costumers and adventure films, particularly those of director Philippe De Broca, including Swords of Blood (1962), Up to His Ears (1965) and The Devil by the Tail (1969). By the 70s, Rochefort's reputation as a comedy star of sex farces and black comedies was firmly established, culminating with his classic roles in The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe (1972), Conspiratia (1973), Le fantôme de la liberté (1974), Affreux, sales et méchants (1976) and Pardon Mon Affaire (1976). He won the Cesar Award (French equivalent of the 'Oscar') for best supporting actor in The Clockmaker of St. Paul (1974) and the best actor trophy for Le Crabe-Tambour (1977). Though he branched out internationally in later years, he earned more kudos for his work in French-made films, especially those directed by Patrice Leconte: Tandem (1987), The Hairdresser's Husband (1990) and the Oscar-nominated Ridicule (1996). Most recently he won praise co-starring as a retired teacher of poetry opposite actor Johnny Hallyday in Man on the Train (2002). Despite his obvious comedic electricity, he has touched audiences as well playing dying naval captains, paraplegics, and timorous, elderly dreamers, often drawing both humor and pathos simultaneously from his characters. Not as well known by America's standards, his sunken, weary features, ever-searching eyes, ever-present moustache and prominent nose are unmistakable in the over 80 films he's graced. A lifetime dream was to play Don Quixote on film and his wish was nearly fulfilled until he took seriously ill and the project had to be indefinitely shelved after only a few days of filming. Rochefort received a special life's achievement Cesar award in 1999.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTY0MDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkxMTY1Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734000","name":"Jean Rochefort","nicknames":["Mon petit Jeannot","Jeannot"],"idIMDB":"nm0734000"},"actorId":"nm0734000","character":"Le colonel Louis Marie Alphonse Toulouse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0069514","main":true},{"actorName":"Mireille Darc","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0014800","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NzA5ODIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM3MzI1NTE@._V1_UY44_CR18,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 May 1938","placeOfBirth":" Toulon, Var, France","birthName":"Mireille Aigroz","height":"5' 7¾\" (1.72 m)","bio":"Mireille Darc was born on May 15, 1938 in Toulon, Var, France as Mireille Aigroz.
