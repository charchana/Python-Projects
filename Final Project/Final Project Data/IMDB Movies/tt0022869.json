Although she achieved stardom early in her career, the tragic Sybille Schmitz could never fit in with her surroundings. Too \"alien looking\" for Hollywood, Schmitz never migrated to America like her more glamorous peers and began losing roles in her native Germany as well due to her vaguely Semitic appearance and ties to the Jewish community. After the war, like many former UFA stars, Sybille was seen as a painful reminder of the Third Reich and she was once more displaced by the optimistic \"new look\" actresses. With acting being her sole reason to thrive, Sybille Schmitz began to drink heavily and rely on drugs as her career sank lower and lower. She finally committed suicide under mysterious circumstances on April 13, 1955, while being \"cared for\" by a corrupt lesbian doctor she was living with at the time of her death.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NTA1MTMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODczODEwMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0773525","name":"Sybille Schmitz","idIMDB":"nm0773525"},"actorId":"nm0773525","character":"Claire Lennartz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0064911","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Hartmann","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0367111","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGMzODdhMWMtOTkwYy00YTM2LWE2ZDctZDg0OWNmOGZiMzExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 January 1889","placeOfBirth":" Fürth, Bavaria, Germany","birthName":"Paul Wilhelm Constantin Hartmann","bio":"Paul Hartmann was born on January 8, 1889 in Fürth, Bavaria, Germany as Paul Wilhelm Constantin Hartmann.
