His mother, Betsy Franco, is Jewish, and his father, Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, was of Portuguese and Swedish descent, and ran a Silicon Valley business. James's mother, a writer, has occasionally acted. Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Whatever It Takes (2000). Although he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy. Next was Deuces Wild (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean (2001). He was recently seen in David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Nights in Rodanthe (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' In the Valley of Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyOTc0MjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgyODQwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556","name":"James Franco","nicknames":["Ted, Teddy"],"idIMDB":"nm0290556"},"actorId":"nm0290556","character":"New Goblin / Harry Osborn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001357","main":true},{"actorName":"Thomas Haden Church","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002006","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkxNDQ1MzIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA1MTA4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 June 1960","placeOfBirth":" Yolo, California, USA","birthName":"Thomas Richard McMillen","height":"5' 11¼\" (1.81 m)","bio":"Thomas Haden Church was born Thomas Richard McMillen in Yolo, California, to Maxine (Sanders) and Carlos Richard McMillen, who was a U.S. marine and surveyor.

She was conceived in Dallas, Texas (the reason for her middle name). Her father, Ron Howard, is a former actor turned Oscar-winning director. Her mother is actress and writer Cheryl Howard (née Alley). Her famous relatives include her uncle, actor Clint Howard, and her grandparents, actors Rance Howard and Jean Speegle Howard. She also has two younger twin sisters, Jocelyn and Paige Howard (also an actress), born in 1985, and a brother, Reed Howard, born in 1987. Her ancestry includes German, English, Scottish, and Irish. Howard was raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, because her parents decided to raise their four children as far away from the trappings of showbiz milieu as possible. During most of her childhood she really did not have much access to a TV. She attended Greenwich Country Day School, and Byram Hills High School in Armonk, New York. At that time, she discovered existentialism and devoured books by Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. She attended the prestigious Steppenwolf School and Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts camp at Catskills together with her friend Natalie Portman. She applied to drama school as Bryce Dallas, dropping her last name to eschew special treatment because of association with her renowned father. From 1999-2003, she studied at the Stella Adler Conservatory and at the New York University Tisch School of Arts and graduated with a BFA degree in Drama in 2003. At that time, she performed in Broadway productions of classical plays by George Bernard Shaw, William Shakespeare and Anton Chekhov. Young Howard appeared in three of her father's films as an extra, including her appearance as a child together with her mother in Apollo 13 (1995). She made her feature-film debut as Heather, a supporting role in Book of Love (2004) by director Alan Brown. Director 'M. Night Shyamalan' was impressed by her performance in a Broadway play and cast her without an audition as a female lead in his two thrillers: The Village (2004) and Lady in the Water (2006). Howard replaced Nicole Kidman in Dogville (2003) sequel, Manderlay (2005). She stars as Rosalind in As You Like It (2006), a reprise of her stage role that made such an impression on Shyamalan. She also played Gwen Stacy in the third installment of the Spider-Man franchise, Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the female lead, Claire, in the sequel Jurassic World (2015). Both films broke the records for highest openings weekends at the time of their release. Among Bryce's other major films are Terminator: Salvation (2009)_, _The Twilight Sage: Eclipse (2010)_, The Help (2011), and 50/50 (2011). Howard became a devoted vegan after Joaquin Phoenix showed her Earthlings (2005), a documentary about animal cruelty. After seeing that, she has consumed no animal products, not even milk or eggs. Her other activities outside of the acting profession include playing basketball and writing. On June 17, 2006, in Connecticut, she married her long-term boyfriend, actor Seth Gabel, whom she met at New York University and had dated for five years. On February 16, 2007, Bryce and her husband, Seth, became parents of their first child, a boy, named Theodore Norman Howard Gabel. Their second child, a daughter, was born in 2012.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkxMzYwMDQzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI2MzcwNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397171","name":"Bryce Dallas Howard","idIMDB":"nm0397171"},"actorId":"nm0397171","character":"Gwen Stacy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001352","main":true},{"actorName":"Rosemary Harris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365281","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzOTExOTE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDY0ODk1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 September 1927","placeOfBirth":" Ashby, Suffolk, England, UK","birthName":"Rosemary Ann Harris","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Rosemary Harris was born on September 19, 1927 in Ashby, Suffolk, England as Rosemary Ann Harris.

He portrayed a Southern police chief in Bill Condon's White Lie (1991) (USA Network), later reteaming with Condon for Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995), and has also acted twice for Michael Apted (Extreme Measures (1996), HBO's Always Outnumbered (1998)) and Gary Fleder (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (1995), Kiss the Girls (1997)). Nunn also turned in a fine performance as Tim Roth's adoptive father in La légende du pianiste sur l'océan (1998), Giuseppe Tornatore's first English-language feature, released initially in Italy and then in the United States in 1999. He can also be seen in Spider-Man (2002), People I Know (2002) with Al Pacino and the prison thriller Lockdown (2000). Nunn has also found time to do numerous television pilots and three series. He was in the CBS series Traps (1994) with George C. Scott, sitcom Local Heroes (1995) for NBC and the critically acclaimed The Job (2001) with Denis Leary on ABC. He has appeared on episodes of Chicago Hope (1994), Touched by an Angel (1994) (both CBS), New York Undercover (1994) and Millennium (1996) (both Fox), among others. Nunn resides in Georgia with his wife Donna and daughters Jessica and Cydney.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1NzE1NTY4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM0NDEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0638056","name":"Bill Nunn","idIMDB":"nm0638056"},"actorId":"nm0638056","character":"Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001380","main":true},{"actorName":"Bruce Campbell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132257","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY2MTg0OTEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ3NTcwMjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 June 1958","placeOfBirth":" Birmingham, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Bruce Lorne Campbell","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"In 1979 with his Detroit friends, Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, Bruce Campbell raised $350,000 for a low-budget film, The Evil Dead (1981), in which he starred and co-executive produced. Completed piecemeal over four years, the film first gained notoriety in England where it became the best-selling video of 1983, beating out The Shining (1980). After its appearance at Cannes, where Stephen King dubbed it \"the most ferociously original horror film of the year\", New Line Cinema stepped forward to release \"Evil Dead\" in the U.S. After co-producing Crimewave (1985), a cross-genre comedy written by Sam Raimi, Ethan and Joel Coen, Campbell moved to Los Angeles and quickly gained a foothold producing or starring in genre films such as the Maniac Cop (1988) series, Lunatics: A Love Story (1991), Moontrap (1989), and Mindwarp (1992), a post-apocalyptic \"Jeremiah Johnson\", during which he met his wife-to-be, filmmaker, Ida Gearon. Campbell then rejoined his Detroit colleagues to star and co-produce the second and third films in the Evil Dead trilogy (Evil Dead II (1987) & Army of Darkness (1992)), completing 12 years of work on the cult favorite. This rough-and-tumble background was a plus as Campbell made his foray into television, first starring in the highly touted Fox series The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. (1993), then as a recurring guest-star on the hit show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993). With these under his belt, Campbell easily made the transition to director, helming numerous episodes and recurring as the King of Thieves in the #1 syndicated Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995), and its follow-up phenomenon, Xena: Warrior Princess (1995). Bruce has since expanded his range on television, appearing in anything from Disney's update of The Wonderful World of Disney: The Love Bug (1997), to decidedly dramatic turns on the acclaimed series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) and The X-Files (1993). At the invitation of ABC, Campbell ventured into the world of sitcoms with a recurring role on ABC's Emmy-nominated Ellen (1994), participating in one of the three touted \"out\" episodes. But Campbell didn't abandon his film roots. During that time, he had featured roles in the blockbuster Congo (1995), John Carpenter's Escape from L.A. (1996), and the award-winning independent crime drama, Running Time (1997). He followed these up with roles in Paramount's romantic comedy, Au service de Sara (2002), Jim Carrey's The Majestic (2001), and all three of Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spider-Man movies. After a return to episodic television in the swashbuckling series, Jack of All Trades (2000), Campbell took the title role in MGM's cult sleeper Bubba Ho-Tep (2002). His directorial debut, Man with the Screaming Brain (2005) premiered on the Sci Fi Channel, and Dark Horse Comics published the comic adaptation. Campbell then directed and starred as himself in My Name Is Bruce (2007), a spoof of his B-movie career, then re-teamed with Disney for their fun-filled hit, Sky High (2005). Campbell has since made the leap into other forms of entertainment, and is enjoying his role as an author with back-to-back New York Times bestsellers: a memoir entitled \"If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor\", and his first novel, \"Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way\". In the multi-media industry, Bruce has enjoyed voicing characters for Disney's animated TV series The Legend of Tarzan (2001) and the Warner Brothers feature The Ant Bully (2006). He also portrayed the character of \"Mayor Shelbourne\" in the animated hit film, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009). Recently, Campbell voiced the role of \"Rod Torque Redline\" in Cars 2 (2011), the sequel to the smash Disney animated feature and for the immensely popular game, \"Call of Duty\". In 2013, Bruce co-produced the hit remake of Evil Dead (2013), joined his filmmaking pal Sam Raimi on Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), and completed an impressive seven-year run on the spy show, Burn Notice (2007) (2007-2013), USA's #1 show on cable. More than two decades after the release of Army of Darkness (1992), Bruce returned to his most iconic role for Ash vs Evil Dead (2015), a highly-anticipated series premiering on the Starz network on Halloween 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY2MTg0OTEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ3NTcwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132257","name":"Bruce Campbell","idIMDB":"nm0132257"},"actorId":"nm0132257","character":"Maître d'","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elizabeth Banks","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006969","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMTcxNDU3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0MzEzNw@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 February 1974","placeOfBirth":" Pittsfield, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Elizabeth Maresal Mitchell","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Elizabeth Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, a small city in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts near the New York border, on February 10, 1974. She is the daughter of Ann (Wallace), who worked in a bank, and Mark P. Mitchell, a factory worker. Elizabeth describes herself as having been seen as a \"goody two-shoes\" in her youth who was nominated for the local Harvest Queen. Banks left home to attend college at the University of Pennsylvania--from which she graduated Magna cum Laude--and went on to attend the Advanced Training Program at the prestigious American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, graduating in 1996. She then moved to New York and worked in the theater, and began getting small roles in films and on television. Seeking more screen work, she moved to Los Angeles and was soon cast in supporting roles. She also had to change her last name, to Banks, in order to avoid confusion with actress Elizabeth Mitchell. Her breakthrough role was as Betty Brant, the secretary of the cantankerous newspaper tycoon in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002). She followed up this performance with small roles in other movies: Swept Away (2002), Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002), Seabiscuit (2003) and The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005). In 2003 she won the Exciting New Face Award at the Young Hollywood Awards. The winsome, beautiful Banks projected an exceptionally charming screen presence that drew comparisons to Audrey Hepburn, and Hollywood eventually began to take notice, Banks being cast in the lead in such films as Kevin Smith's Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) and in Oliver Stone's biopic of George W. Bush, W. (2008), as Laura Bush. In television Banks was a recurring guest star on Scrubs (2001) as Dr. Kim Briggs, the love interest of Zach Braff's J.D. In 2010 she was cast as Alec Baldwin's love interest in season four of 30 Rock (2006). Originally scheduled to appear in only four episodes, she was brought back as a recurring character for two more seasons, and earned Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for two consecutive years. Banks has more recently appeared in such films as Our Idiot Brother (2011), Man on a Ledge (2012), What to Expect When You're Expecting (2012), People Like Us (2012), and Pitch Perfect (2012). She also won the coveted role as Effie Trinket in The Hunger Games (2012) and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). Banks married Max Handelman, a sports writer and producer, in 2003. They have two sons, Felix, who was born in March 2011, and Magnus, born in Nov. 2012, both by gestational surrogacy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMTcxNDU3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0MzEzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006969","name":"Elizabeth Banks","idIMDB":"nm0006969"},"actorId":"nm0006969","character":"Miss Brant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001351","main":true},{"actorName":"Ted Raimi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001646","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTIwMTI4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ3OTExOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 December 1965","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Theodore R.
