Starting young, LaDon took advantage of every play at school and every pageant that remote, west Texas had to offer. Receiving not only accolades but also rewards, such as best actress from the Lone Star State's Interscholastic League, LaDon enrolled in the theater program at what is now Texas State University. After earning a B.F.A. in Theatre, she moved to Los Angeles and began the struggle of finding work. Her first job allowing for her SAG membership was that of an undercover FBI agent in CBS's mini-series: The Siege at Ruby Ridge (1996) directed by Roger Young. Working with the generous Laura Dern and hilarious Randy Quaid, LaDon knew she was on the right track. Television work continued whilst the stage called. In 2002, LaDon met Giorgio Serafini, an Italian director and writer. They immediately connected and were married January 10, 2004. Since their union, the partnership allows for both their creative forces to collide. One such example of their inspiration is the short film War (2005), written and directed by Giorgio, in which LaDon plays a US soldier in Iraq. The film was selected to numerous festivals worldwide and can be found as a feature on the DVD of The Good War (2002) starring Roy Scheider, a feature also written and directed by Giorgio. When in Italy, LaDon tackles the language well enough to find work. She is also a writer and filming is slated early next year for a short film adapted from one of her stories. Although she is no major star (yet), LaDon has come a long way from Hamlin, Texas. She constantly finds inspiration all around while absorbing an international way of life.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUxNDg3MzU5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc1ODE2OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1227396","name":"LaDon Drummond","idIMDB":"nm1227396"},"actorId":"nm1227396","character":"Sarah","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Natasha Green","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3605158","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NjMyNzY0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk0MjU2NzE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Natasha Green is an actress, known for Johnny's Gone (2011) and My Boy (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NjMyNzY0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk0MjU2NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3605158","name":"Natasha Green","idIMDB":"nm3605158"},"actorId":"nm3605158","character":"Alex","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Johnny Sinclair","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3425090","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE3MzU5NzAwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU4ODU3OTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Johnny SInclair Serafini","bio":"Johnny Sinclair was born as Johnny SInclair Serafini.

Although Bailey started college at Lamar University in Beaumont, he eventually transferred to Texas Tech University in Lubbock. He did not complete his studies. He worked at local theater companies during the mid 1960s until his move to California, sometime in the 1970s. Here he began his work on such television series as Starsky and Hutch (1975), Charlie's Angels (1976) and CHiPs (1977). He eventually got a movie debut role in the Chuck Norris movie A Force of One (1979) before landing the role of Luther Rizzo in M*A*S*H (1972). In 1993, he returned to Texas to study again, this time at Southwest Texas State University. In 1994, he graduated with a Bachelor's degree of Fine Arts, Theatre and, for the 1999-2000 school year, he was the Artist in Residence. While in his 30s, Bailey went prematurely gray, leading to roles of characters much older than his actual age. Although he prefers dramatic acting, his most famous role will always be that of Captain Thaddeus Harris in Police Academy (1984). Since his goddaughter was diagnosed with leukemia, he has worked voluntarily for the Sunshine Kids Foundation, organizing trips for young cancer sufferers. In 2001, he was announced as the executive director of the foundation.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MDMzNzU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY2MDc1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047265","name":"G.W.

With rugged good-looks, a muscular build and a charming personality, it was a natural for him to move from the world of fighting to that of acting. Born Gary Edward Daniels on May 9, 1963 in Woking, Surrey, England, Daniels was a childhood fan of legendary martial arts film star Bruce Lee. He followed his idol by studying Kung Fu. Demonstrating a natural ability for the sport of full-contact karate (also known as kick-boxing), Daniels embarked on a ring career with the dream of winning a world title. Fighting in tournaments in England, Daniels' aggressive ring style made him a fan favorite, but did not sit well with the British officials. Daniels posted a 12-3-0 kick-boxing record with all 12 victories by knockouts. All three of defeats were by disqualification,including one to Micheal J. Heming; future Jean-Claude Van Damme opponent. Daniels decided that his best bet was to fight in the United States, so he traveled to Florida and began competing there. In 1980, Daniels made his United States debut at the Sunshine State Tournament in Miami. In his opening match, Daniels defeated local favorite 'Sherman 'Big Train' Bergman', who a year earlier had lost to Jean-Claude Van Dammeat the World Full-Contact Championships. However, in his next fight, Daniels was eliminated from the tournament after he lost a 3 round decision. The sport of kick-boxing was taking off in Southern California, and after a few matches, Gary Daniels decided to leave Florida and continue his career in California. He soon established himself as a top contender for the world title. He appeared in numerous martial arts magazines, and his knockout streak continued to grow. Soon after winning the PKA (Professional Karate Association) Lightheavyweight Kickboxing Championship, Daniels decided to retire from active competition. It was 1993, and Daniels ended his fighting days with a 22-4-0 (21 knockouts) record. His ring fame helped land him small roles in the hit television series, Miami Vice. Daniels later traveled to the Philippines to make martial arts films. From there Gary went into mainstream film-making; acting in over 45 movies, as well as producing some of his own motion pictures. Gary Daniels reportedly made a comeback in Thailand at the age of 45, but after losing a decision, he decided to end any future thoughts of fighting.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MTMzMzAxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU1MzY4ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199939","name":"Gary Daniels","idIMDB":"nm0199939"},"actorId":"nm0199939","character":"Roy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Lathan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0490130","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"John Christopher Lathan","bio":"John Lathan was born as John Christopher Lathan.
