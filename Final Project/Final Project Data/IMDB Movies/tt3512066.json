After a career as an internationally acclaimed lyricist, he lost all language and was only able to say two phrases: \"The Possibilities are Endless\" and \"Grace Maxwell\". The film is narrated by Edwyn, trapped inside his devastated mind and his wife Grace, the woman who pulled him back to life. More than just a story of determination against all odds; it is an intimate and life-affirming journey of rediscovery that celebrates how love, music and language shape our lives.","simplePlot":"Imagine your mind has been wiped: memories, knowledge, experiences, language - every word you ever spoke, has vanished. If eventually you found the words, what would you say? For Edwyn Collins, 'The Possibilities Are Endless'.","actors":[{"actorName":"Edwyn Collins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172294","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MDM3NDEzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM5NzEzMTE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 August 1959","placeOfBirth":" Edinburgh, Scotland, UK","bio":"Edwyn Collins was born on August 23, 1959 in Edinburgh, Scotland.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MDM3NDEzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM5NzEzMTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172294","name":"Edwyn Collins","idIMDB":"nm0172294"},"actorId":"nm0172294","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Grace Maxwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3826115","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Grace Maxwell yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3826115","name":"Grace Maxwell","idIMDB":"nm3826115"},"actorId":"nm3826115","character":"Herself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"William Collins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6267493","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for William Collins yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6267493","name":"William Collins","idIMDB":"nm6267493"},"actorId":"nm6267493","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yasmin Paige","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1306081","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzY3NzYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQ1MzEz._V1_UY44_CR11,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"June1991","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Yasmin Paige was born in June 1991 in London, England.
