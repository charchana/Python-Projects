Attending the University of Washington after high school, she received her BA degree in fine arts. Her first professional season was with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival where she performed in \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" among others. During this time she built up a strong resume in regional theater with such companies as the Hartford Stage Company, Pittsburgh Public Theatre, Seattle Repertory Theatre, Alaska Repertory Theatre and Alliance Theatre. Her first significant break came with a starring role in the potent, critically-acclaimed lesbian drama \"Last Summer at Bluefish Cove,\" which earned her an Off-Broadway Drama Desk nomination in 1980. She capped this honor with a Los Angeles Drama Critics award in 1983 when she repeated her triumph on the West Coast. Jean made an auspicious Broadway debut in 1981 playing Marlene Dietrich in \"Piaf\", and it was the subsequent TV taping of that show that brought about Hollywood interest. She struggled for a time in unsuccessful sitcoms (Teachers Only (1982), Reggie (1983) and Maximum Security (1984)) before hitting gold as the feather-brained Charlene Frazier on Designing Women (1986). She met future husband Richard Gilliland on the set of the hit show; he played the recurring role of Annie Potts' boyfriend for a few seasons. Jean and Richard's son Connor was born in 1989. Feeling confined and typecast in light material, Jean left the show in 1991 to branch out and drew major acclaim in such made-for-TV movies as Overkill: The Aileen Wuornos Story (1992). She gave a chilling portrayal as the well-known serial killer more than a decade before Charlize Theron copped an Oscar for her cinematic version. On the other side of the coin, Jean offered gentle, heartfelt performances in such TV films as The Yarn Princess (1994), in which she played a mentally disabled mom, and the TV remake of The Yearling (1994), allowing audiences to rediscover her amazing versatility. On stage she earned a Tony nomination for her delightfully madcap part in the Broadway farce \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" opposite Nathan Lane, and on TV won bookend Emmy awards for her guest appearances on the sitcom Frasier (1993). Films would never be a reliable venue for Jean, who made her big-screen debut in Flashpoint (1984). She did, however, receive an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her part in Guinevere (1999). Diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at age 13, Jean has played an active part over the years in public awareness.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNjg0MjUxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyNjY0MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005443","name":"Jean Smart","idIMDB":"nm0005443"},"actorId":"nm0005443","character":"Laura Brandston","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Schuyler Fisk","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004922","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQxOTcwOTM0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjIxMjU3MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 July 1982","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Schuyler Elizabeth Fisk","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"The actress and singer-songwriter Schuyler Fisk is the daughter of Academy Award-winning actress Sissy Spacek and production designer Jack Fisk, who met on the set of Badlands (1973), which starred Spacek (Fisk was the art director on the film).

Pam has been a major African-American star from the early 1970s. Her career started in 1971, when Roger Corman of New World Pictures launched her with The Big Doll House (1971), about a women's penitentiary, and The Big Bird Cage (1972). Her strong role put her into a five-year contract with Samuel Z. Arkoff of American-International Pictures, and she became a leading lady in action films such as Jack Hill's Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974), the comic strip character Friday Foster (1975) and William Girdler's 'Sheba, Baby' (1975). She continued working with American-International, where she portrayed William Marshall's vampire victim in the Blacula (1972) sequel, Scream Blacula Scream (1973). During the 1980s she became a regular on Miami Vice (1984) and played a supporting role as an evil witch in Ray Bradbury's and Walt Disney Pictures' Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983), then returned to action as Steven Seagal's partner in Above the Law (1988). Her most famous role of the 1990s was probably Jackie Brown (1997), directed by Quentin Tarantino, which was an homage to her earlier 1970s action roles, She occasionally did supporting roles, as in Tim Burton's Mars Attacks! (1996), In Too Deep (1999) and a funny performance in Jawbreaker (1999). She also appeared in John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars (2001) and co-starred with Snoop Dogg in Bones (2001). Her entire career of over 30 years has brought only success for this beautiful and talented actress. A sister of Grier's died from cancer in 1990 and the son of that sister committed suicide because of his mother's illness. Pam herself was diagnosed with cancer in 1988 and given 18 months to live, which has had an effect on how she has chosen to live. She has never been wed, although she has been romantically linked to Richard Pryor and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the past.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxNDEwNDA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY1NjgyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000427","name":"Pam Grier","idIMDB":"nm0000427"},"actorId":"nm0000427","character":"Tina","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0054024","main":true},{"actorName":"John Schneider","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0773884","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NzY0MTk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDc3OTI4._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 April 1960","placeOfBirth":" Mount Kisco, New York, USA","birthName":"John Richard Schneider III","height":"6' 3½\" (1.92 m)","bio":"John Richard Schneider was born April 8, 1960, in Mt.
