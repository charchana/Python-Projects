He started his directing career in 1962 after studying film making in Moscow. His first feature film The Boys (1962) was a proof of his talent and earned him a Jussi Award for directing. During the next 12 months he also directed movies Sissit (1963) - which he won an Jussi Award for directing also - and Hopeaa rajan takaa (1963). All of these three movies were war-themed. During the next few years he worked for TV, but returned to film industry in 1966 with his film Amour libre (1966). The film became a huge success with 700,000 tickets sold to screenings. The film stays in Finnish film industry as 12th highest grossing Finnish film of the history. It was also sold to several different countries. Niskanen won a Jussi for directing. His next two films Une jeune fille finlandaise (1967) and Asfalttilampaat (1968) weren't so well received, but earned him a Jussi for directing the first one. In early 1970s he directed Song of the Bloodred Flower (1971) which was everything but a success. He made his comeback with Eight Deadly Shots (1972) which was originally produced for TV. 5-hour movie was eventually cut to a little over two hours for a theatrical release. The film earned him two Jussis; one for directing, another one for best leading role. Niskanen never had the same success that he had with Kahdeksan surmanluotia (1972). His other films of 1970s didn't turn to box office hits or award winners. In the 1980s he received his sixth and last Jussi for directing for his film Course forcée (1982). After it, he directed also two films based on popular novels; Life's Hardy Men (1986) and Lumberjacking (1988) before his death in 1990.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0632852","name":"Mikko Niskanen","idIMDB":"nm0632852"},"actorId":"nm0632852","character":"Man in the dance hall","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0060613","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060613","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":[],"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 29 min (89 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Black and White"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Suomi-Filmi Oy, Finland"],"filmLength":["2,385 m (1967) (Sweden)","2,445 m (Finland)","2,445 m"],"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.9","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Finland"}],"awards":[{"award":"Jussi Awards 1967","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Jussi","categories":[{"category":"Best Actor (Paras näyttelijä)","names":[{"name":"Jukka Sipilä","id":"nm0802634","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Direction (Paras ohjaus)","names":[{"name":"Mikko Niskanen","id":"nm0632852","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Script (Paras käsikirjoitus)","names":[{"name":"Marja-Leena Mikkola","id":"nm0586588","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Cinematography (Paras kuvaus)","names":[{"name":"Esko Nevalainen","id":"nm0627284","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Music (Paras musiikki)","names":[{"name":"Kaj Chydenius","id":"nm0161578","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Producer (Paras tuottaja)","names":[]}]}]}],"votes":"517","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0014497","name":"FJ-Filmi"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["countryside","youth","topless","drunk","dance","sex scene","full frontal female nudity","pubic hair","premarital sex","bare breasts","infidelity","snake bite","snake","fantasy sequence","cine camera","home movie camera","summer holiday","holiday","full frontal male nudity","full frontal nudity","male nudity","sauna","female nudity","couple","finnish summer","singing","black and white","twenty something","young couple","finnish new wave","drunkenness","tent","swimming","skinny dipping","lake","young adult","troubled youth","summer","student","nature","movie star","jealousy","forest","coming of age","character driven","camping","boyfriend girlfriend relationship","1960s","young people","finland","camping trip"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 17:48:44"}}
