All four boys were born in Santa Barbara, California (Timothy on August 30, 1951; some sources indicate 1950), as children of James \"Bud\" Bottoms, a sculptor and high school art teacher, and his wife Betty. Artistic expression was certainly encouraged in this family and Timothy expressed an avid interest, even during his preschool years, of wanting to perform. Raised in Santa Barbara, he was a member of the Youth Theater Productions at school and in 1967 toured Europe along with the Santa Barbara Madrigal Society, which sealed his aspirations. Following high school, Timothy was spotted by Universal in a stage production of \"Romeo and Juliet\" and chosen (with no prior film experience) for a lead part in director Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun (1971). As Joe, a young American soldier who is shelled and left armless and legless on the last day of World War I, Timothy received excellent reviews and earned a Golden Globe nomination as \"Most Promising Newcomer.\" His next starring role propelled him into the top leagues. Cast as aimless Texas-boy \"Sonny,\" the sensitive, mournful-eyed, youthful focus of Peter Bogdanovich's downbeat Oscar winner The Last Picture Show (1971), the film went on to make full-fledged stars not only of Timothy, but of Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd. Younger brother Sam, who frequently visited the set, wound up touchingly cast as another young but ill-fated character. The early 1970s was a time of great personal accomplishments for Bottoms in film. Engagingly maladroit and looking slightly uncomfortable in his own skin, he proved that his first reviews were no flukes. He appeared to great advantage in the touching drama Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing (1973) opposite British acting doyenne Maggie Smith and as the tousle-haired college protagonist in the coming-of-age box-office hit The Paper Chase (1973). In an effort to break free of his sensitive prototype, he delved into stranger, darker characters with The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder (1974) and Rollercoaster (1977). These efforts were less successful, however, and he quickly began to discover his film career slipping away at the early age of 26. Outgrowing his awkward adorableness, he shifted to the smaller screen in order to secure challenging roles, such as the biblical lead in The Story of David (1976); his ex-convict in A Small Town in Texas (1976); his bank teller in Arthur Hailey's the Moneychangers (1976); his fatally-stricken track runner in A Shining Season (1979), and the Raymond Massey role (in which he aged 30 years) in the ambitious mini-series East of Eden (1981), with brother Sam recreating the James Dean part. Timothy's success certainly encouraged his younger siblings. By this time Joseph, Sam and Ben were were all experiencing significant lifts in their own respective careers. As a group, the four brothers hooked up together for the TV movie Island Sons (1987), in which they all played brothers and used their real first names. The movie was promoted as a pilot for an upcoming weekly series, but it failed to make the grade. While Timothy continued to work steadily throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the quality of material he was given grew more standard. Roles in such films as Invaders from Mars (1986), The Drifter (1988) and the foreign-made Istanbul (1989) did little to reignite his earlier success. A sequel to his famous \"The Last Picture Show\", entitled Texasville (1990), could have had heads turning but the movie decided instead to focus instead on Jeff Bridges (who at this juncture was a big name star) while Timothy's character was given short shrift with what was essentially a cameo. Into the millennium Timothy had a slight taste of his former glory while showing a keen talent for parody with his uncanny impersonation of president George W. Bush. Who would have thought? Bottoms' dead-on spoof on That's My Bush! (2001), courtesy of the creators of \"South Park\", led to a brief Bush cameo in the family film Traqueur de croco en mission périlleuse (2002) and the much more serious TV-movie DC 9/11: Time of Crisis (2003). Interestingly, Timothy needed little in the way of prosthetics. He simply parted his hair differently, added a bit of a drawl and imitated his walk! The still boyish-looking actor with that same trickle of sadness and discomfort has worked continuously for the past thirty years and appeared in over 65 films. Of late he has shined in small independent features such as with his dysfunctional father in Gus Van Sant Elephant (2003), which chronicled a Columbine High School-like massacre, and his closer-to-home portrayal as a middle-aged actor in search of his early fame in Paradise, Texas (2005). More recently is a role in the remake of Jack London's Call of the Wild (2009). Timothy's marriage to folk singer Alicia Cory from 1975 to 1978, produced son Bartholomew. He has three other children (Benton, William, Bridget) with current wife (since 1984) Marcia Morehart. Bottoms divides his time between his acting work and his other great love of training wild horses at his two ranches near Big Sur, California. On the sly he has worked as a surveyor's assistant. While two of his brothers, Joseph and Ben, have virtually abandoned their film careers for satisfying lives outside the Hollywood realm, Sam died at 53 of brain cancer. Timothy continues to pursue his Hollywood career decided to venture on.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0MzU5MDEyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjc1Mjg3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000961","name":"Timothy Bottoms","idIMDB":"nm0000961"},"actorId":"nm0000961","character":"Casey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Deana Jurgens","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432911","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Deana was born in London on October 7, 1957, the daughter of film actress Eva Bartok and an unknown father. Her birth received great publicity at the time for several reasons. For starters, it was unheard of that a major movie star would admit to a pregnancy out of wedlock. Miss Bartok was divorced from her fourth husband, actor Curd Jürgens, and denied that he had any involvement in this pregnancy. Things got more complicated when Bartok was diagnosed in Los Angeles with a tumor that had to be urgently removed and meant that her pregnancy would be terminated in the surgery. Instead of submitting to doctors in L.A., the star flew to London for second opinions but was told basically the same thing. An avid student of Subud, an Indonesian philosophy, Miss Bartok decided to postpone the surgery and submitted herself to Subud's spiritual exercises. When everybody thought she was dying, Eva gave birth to a healthy baby girl whom she named Deana Grazia and shortly afterwards she, herself, was back working in a German film. The tumor had miraculously disappeared and she was in perfect health. These remarkable happenings changed Miss Bartok forever as well as her commitment to acting. She moved with her mother and baby to the Subud compound in Cilandak, Indonesia where Deana was raised and educated. In 1970, Bartok left her family behind and settled in Los Angeles where she wrote articles and lectured in universities about Subud. There's evidence that later on Deana and her grandmother joined Bartok in California but details are not clear. Deana returned to the public eye when she launched a short-lived career as a film actress in the early 1980s. Several years later, she became the center of media attention again when her mother revealed that Deana was fathered by Frank Sinatra. It is truly mystifying why Miss Bartok kept this a secret for so long nor what she expected to achieve with this revelation. By all accounts, she was a deeply spiritual individual who never cared much about financial gain so it is very unlikely that she would come up with such a story in order to con money out of \"old blue eyes\". On the other hand, there was never any formal rebuttal to Bartok claim from Sinatra or his family, which leaves the subject of Deana's paternity an open question. Among so many mysteries, it is also strange that Deanna decided to use \"Jurgens\" as her last name in films. She presently resides in Sydney, Australia, \"an attractive divorcée with two children\" according to confirmed reports. Eva Bartok died in London in 1998.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0432911","name":"Deana Jurgens","idIMDB":"nm0432911"},"actorId":"nm0432911","character":"Marcia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Phillip Law","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492342","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNjI5MzE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc4NzgyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 September 1937","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"John Phillip Law was born on September 7, 1937 in Los Angeles, California, USA.

He was soon a teenage heartthrob, his blond hair and blue eyes appearing frequently on the covers of movie magazines. His most successful film was Parrish (1961), in which he played the title character. A few years after that his career went into a decline; he made only a few television movies between the mid-'60s and his small role in The Godfather: Part II (1974) (in which his character's name, Merle Johnson, was actually his real name).

He received a B.A. from the Liberal Arts College of Loyola University majoring in English with minors in Philosophy and Languages. Brian's stellar artistic career began in New York City when he co-starred on Broadway in the dramatic musical of the great John Ford Film, \"How Green Was My Valley\". A talent scout for Universal Studios saw him onstage and convinced the studio to offer him a movie contract. He began work at Universal Studios with Harrison Ford and Katharine Ross, also under contract. Harrison and Brian did \"Journey To Shiloh\" together and Katherine and Brian were chosen by director, Mike Nichols, to be the wedding couple in his classic film The Graduate (1967). Brian is also featured as Diane Keaton's boyfriend in Woody Allen's Sleeper (1973), as well as roles in numerous other motion pictures, television shows and theatrical plays. Upon the release of The Graduate (1967), 'Gregory Peck (1916-2003)' offered to recommend Brian to the Board of Governors of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for membership in the Actors Branch which then invited him to join. Brian has been a very active participant in The Academy's activities and has been invited to serve on multiple committees. Brian was initially invited to join The Academy's Foreign Language Film Committee (FLFC) and thereafter invited to serve on the Executive Committee with some of the most prestigious people in the entertainment business like 'Robert Wise (I) (1914-2005)', 'Fay Kanin (1917-2013)' and Mark Johnson. As a member of the Executive Committee of the FLFC he was asked to be the Official Academy Host to incoming directors for The Academy Awards. Among the directors he has hosted are: Ang Lee, Giuseppe Tornatore, Sergei Bodrov, Paula van der Oest, 'Sven Nykvist (1922-2006)' and Walter Salles among others. He served for some years on The Documentary Committee. He now serves on the Executive Committee for The Student Academy Awards which fosters the great filmmakers of the future and the Membership Screening Committee which selects the films Academy members will see from all the films the studios and distributors submit for Academy Award consideration. He also serves as an Academy judge for AMPAS's Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting Competition which fosters the screenwriters of tomorrow and which has helped to develop the careers of many of the top screenwriters creating films today. Serving on these committees has put Brian in direct contact with some of the world's greatest international directors, the filmmakers of the future and extraordinary screenwriters. The high level of contacts provided by The Academy prompted Brian to transition into producing. He brought Collision (2004) to the Yari Film Group where he is based and the film won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Subsequently, he is credited on Shortcut to Happiness (2003) the re-make of \"The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941)\", starring Sir Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin, Where the Red Fern Grows (2003) starring Dave Matthews and Flashbacks of a Fool (2008) starring Daniel Craig as an Executive Producer. Brian is producing the action drama, \"Venice Pier\", which came via AMPAS Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting program that Creative Artists Agency (CAA) is packaging. Brian has been invited to participate for the past several years in several film festivals which include: the American Film Institute (AFI) FEST as a part of their Kodak Connect which connects outstanding film professionals with the AFI filmmakers. He has connected and collaborated with many excellent international filmmakers. The Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles (IFFLA) has invited Brian to be introduced to the incoming Indian filmmakers to advise them and collaborate with them. He has also been invited to be a judge for The Polish Film Festival of Los Angeles for their narrative film competition. Polish Cinema has given us some of the greatest filmmakers like Krzysztof Kieslowski, Agnieszka Holland and Roman Polanski, so this is an esteemed honor and put him in contact with the Polish filmmakers of today. Brian is a member of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), the Actors Equity Association (AEA) and AMPAS. He has also taught as a private teacher of voice and a public teacher of English as a Second Language, Mathematics and Cultural Studies for the Los Angeles Unified School District, Adult Division. He is married to Nicole Avery, a psychotherapist. They have two children, Eric, the co-founder and world-renowned original bassist of JANE'S ADDICTION, and Rebecca, a gifted actress and mother of their first grand-child, Henry.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4ODQ1NTEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIzNzgzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0043011","name":"Brian Avery","idIMDB":"nm0043011"},"actorId":"nm0043011","character":"Forbes","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Stahl","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0821489","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 January 1932","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","bio":"Richard Stahl was born on January 4, 1932 in Detroit, Michigan, USA.
