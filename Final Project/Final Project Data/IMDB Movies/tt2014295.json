He is the eldest of three children with a younger sister named Daisy and and younger brother named Ben. His father's name is also William's middle name. He wanted to act since he was 10 years old. The young actor had a small role in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (2002) as Forrester, and he was cast as an extra in Cider with Rosie (1998). However, his big break came when he was cast in the part of Peter Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005), picked out of thousands of boys for the role. He hopes he won't end up type-cast as Peter and to go on to carve a successful, well-rounded career in acting and directing in the future. William completed Year 13 in 2006, with A Levels in Media Studies, English and Drama. In autumn 2006, he moved to New York for several weeks to study acting under Sheila Gray, where he trained at the famous Gleeson's gym in Brooklyn in preparation for filming The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjFhMTVkOGItZTg1NS00OTQ1LTliYTYtNjAyYzJkZWM0N2YxL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzA1OTU2MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608440","name":"William Moseley","nicknames":["Wizzle"],"idIMDB":"nm0608440"},"actorId":"nm0608440","character":"Andreas Gruber","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Eugenia Costantini","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1361686","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Eugenia Costantini is an actress, known for 18 Years Later (2010), Una famiglia perfetta (2012) and The Silent Mountain (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1361686","name":"Eugenia Costantini","idIMDB":"nm1361686"},"actorId":"nm1361686","character":"Francesca Calzolari","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Claudia Cardinale","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001012","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MTM4MTEzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDExMzQ2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 April 1938","placeOfBirth":" Tunis, French Protectorate Tunisia [now Tunisia]","birthName":"Claude Joséphine Rose Cardinale","height":"5' 6¼\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Like many other female Italian film stars, Claudia Cardinale's entry into the business was by way of a beauty pageant. She was 17 years old and studying at the Centro Sperimentale in Rome when she entered a beauty contest, which resulted in her getting a succession of small film roles. Her earthy interpretations of Sicilian women got her noticed by Italian producers, and the combination of her beauty, dark, flashing eyes, explosive sexuality and genuine acting talent virtually guaranteed her stardom. After Careless (1962) she rose to the front ranks of Italian cinema, and became an international star in Federico Fellini's classic 8½ (1963) with Marcello Mastroianni. American audiences may best remember her from her starring role in Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MTM4MTEzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDExMzQ2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001012","name":"Claudia Cardinale","idIMDB":"nm0001012"},"actorId":"nm0001012","character":"Nuria Calzolari","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Emily Cox","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2686957","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjExMTIxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYyNzkzNjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 February 1985","placeOfBirth":" Vienna, Austria","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Emily Cox was born on February 23, 1985 in Vienna, Austria.
