He works since he was a little boy, and has obtained with the years a remarkable evolution from soap opera gallant and tv comedies to an excellent leading figure of the most importants Argentinian movies. At the age of 10 he made his debut in a play along with his parents, actor Ricardo Darín Sr., and actess Renée Roxana. He acted for several years in TV series (such as Alta Comedia and Estación Retiro), where he reached popularity as a young leading actor in different soap operas, specially in Alberto Migre's productions. In the 90s, he achieved a great success in the TV comedy \"Mi Cuñado\" (1993), in which he co-starred with Luis Brandoni. He never left theater and continued acting in plays like \"Sugar\", \"Extraña Pareja\", \"Taxi\", \"Algo en Común\" and \"Art\". At that time, he directed plays and movies like \"He nacido en la ribera\", \"La Rabona\" y \"Los Exitos del Amor\". The first time the critic emphasized his performance was in the movie \"Perdido por Perdido\" (1993), Alberto Lecchi's debut as a film director. Then, he played in \"El Faro\" (1998), \"El Mismo Amor La Misma Lluvia\" (1999), and \"Nueve Reinas\" (2000), brilliantly portraying Marcos. Once again, he colaborated with director Eduardo Mignona when he portrayed Domingo Santaló in \"La Fuga\" (2001). In 2001 he played Rafael Belvedere in \"El Hijo de la Novia\" (nominated in the foreign language category at the 2002 Oscars), crowning his career. Currently (2005), he is on tour with the play \"Art\" all over the world. He lives with his wife, Florencia Bas, and his children, Ricardo Jr. and Clara.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxOTAyMTAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE2MTUzOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201857","name":"Ricardo Darín","nicknames":["Richard"],"idIMDB":"nm0201857"},"actorId":"nm0201857","character":"Simón","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0556676","main":true},{"actorName":"Nancy Dupláa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0243257","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 December 1969","placeOfBirth":" Olivos, Vicente López, Buenos Aires, Argentina","birthName":"Nancy Verónica Dupláa","height":"5' 4½\" (1.64 m)","bio":"Nancy Dupláa was born on December 3, 1969 in Olivos, Vicente López, Buenos Aires, Argentina as Nancy Verónica Dupláa.
