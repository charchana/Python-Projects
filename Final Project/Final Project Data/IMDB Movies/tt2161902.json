From forcing his childhood friends to perform with him to actually starring in plays as a teenager. Joshua was finally given a video camera and his fate was sealed. He would make many home movies with his friends, and show them at parties and gatherings. He always enjoyed writing stories, and poems, but found that writing scripts was one of his favorite things to do. As he got older, he began to get serious about acting and began auditioning for short films around town and commercials. He has acted in several short films, features and commercials as well as various 48hr film competitions. He became a part of the Improv Troupe 'The Denials' for years and then proceeded to do more theater during that time. He has written a television pilot, a feature film, as well as several short films that have been produced under Frozen Fire Productions with him acting as Director on most of the projects. He moved from Texas to reside in Los Angeles, California, where he graduated from the Upright Citizen's Brigade improv school. It was in one of those classes where he met Piper Hinson and started the Youtube Channel and company Just Giggle It, they have tens of thousands of subscribers, millions of views and it is home to the series Joshua Thomas created and stars in 'Harley Quinn & The Joker VS. The Real World' where he plays The Joker, he also Directs, Writes, Edits, And Produces every episode of the series. Although he wears many hats, he does that because he wants the show to be made and with a limited budget, that is what needs to be done, but he primarily focuses on acting and writing outside of Just Giggle It.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3NjM5NDMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ0OTI2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5067565","name":"Joshua Thomas","idIMDB":"nm5067565"},"actorId":"nm5067565","character":"Sigma Team Leader","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alejandro Vargas-Lugo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4819673","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MjIxNzc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk0ODMzNzE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Alejandro Vargas-Lugo is known for his work on Fuse (2012), The Peaceful Warrior (2015) and Among Thieves.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MjIxNzc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk0ODMzNzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4819673","name":"Alejandro Vargas-Lugo","idIMDB":"nm4819673"},"actorId":"nm4819673","character":"Reynaldo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2161902","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2161902","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["8 min"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"9.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"San Antonio, Texas, USA"}],"awards":[],"votes":"52","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0350147","name":"Kris Kidd Productions"},{"idCompany":"co0259664","name":"Live Wire Films"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["epidemic"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:44:20"}}
