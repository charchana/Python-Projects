He spent most of his childhood growing up in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. At a very young age, Lucas' family quickly noticed that he had an affinity for impersonating voices and characters. When he was 11 years old, his mother enrolled him in local acting classes, and it wasn't long before he was discovered by Atlanta agent, Joy Pervis. Lucas began booking almost immediately in print, local, regional, and national commercials. Soon after, he was cast in his first movie role as Harry Vanderbilt in The Adventures of Ociee Nash, starring Keith Carradine and Mare Winningham. He was a natural for film roles and continued his success by landing his first co-starring role in Lightning Bug with Laura Prepon and Brett Harrison. Lucas made his first trip to Los Angeles when he was 13 year old. Shortly after returning to Atlanta, he booked the sought after role of Jack Cash, older brother of Johnny Cash, in the award winning biopic, Walk the Line, directed by James Mangold, produced by Cathy Konrad, starring Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix. With high school quickly approaching, Lucas made the decision to stay in Atlanta to attend and experience public high school. He continued acting and was cast in movies for Lifetime Television and several independent features including Dance of the Dead (2008), which was directed by Gregg Bishop and hand-picked by director Sam Raimi for distribution through Lionsgate and Ghost House Pictures. Three weeks before graduating high school with honors, Lucas auditioned for Disney's Hannah Montana: The Movie and was cast in the lead role of Travis Brody. After only one week on the set, Lucas flew back to Atlanta to graduate with his high school class of 2008. Lucas now resides in Los Angeles pursuing his career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA5ODYwMDc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM1MDA0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1395771","name":"Lucas Till","idIMDB":"nm1395771"},"actorId":"nm1395771","character":"Cayden Richards","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Stephen McHattie","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0570385","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MTM2NTQzN15BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 February 1947","placeOfBirth":" Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada","birthName":"Stephen McHattie Smith","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Stephen McHattie was born on February 3, 1947 in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada as Stephen McHattie Smith.

He is the son of Coni (Lemke), a photographer, and Joseph Momoa, a painter. His father is of Hawaiian descent and his mother, who is from Iowa, is of mostly German ancestry. Jason was raised in Norwalk, Iowa by his mother. After high school, he moved to Hawaii where he landed a lead role out of thousands of hopefuls in the T.V. series, Baywatch (1989) (known as \"Baywatch Hawaii\" in its tenth season). When the show ended, he spent the next couple of years traveling around the world. In 2001, he moved to Los Angeles where he continued to pursue an acting career. In 2004, after the short-lived T.V. series North Shore (2004), he was cast as the popular character \"Ronon Dex\" in the T.V. series Stargate: Atlantis (2004), which achieved a cult-like following. In 2010, he appeared in the Emmy-nominated H.B.O. series Game of Thrones (2011) playing the Dothraki King, \"Khal Drogo\". To illustrate to the producers he was Khal Drogo, he performed the Haka, a traditional war dance of the Maori of New Zealand. The audition was with the same casting director who was casting the titular role in the reboot of Conan the Barbarian (2011). Four weeks after he was cast as the popular Robert E. Howard character, he began shooting in Bulgaria. His approach, like the film-makers, was to pull from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Jason has a production company, \"Pride of Gypsies\", in which he is expanding his career from actor to filmmaker. He has directed a couple of short films and is working on his feature film debut \"Road to Paloma\" which is pulled from a series of stories he's been developing over the years which he calls the Brown Bag Diaries: Ridin' the Blinds in B Minor (2010). Jason lives with actress Lisa Bonet with whom he has two children: Lola and Nakoa-Wolf.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MTU5NjM1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc4MDk0Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597388","name":"Jason Momoa","idIMDB":"nm0597388"},"actorId":"nm0597388","character":"Connor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0545338","main":true},{"actorName":"Janet-Laine Green","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0337945","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDkyNTkxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTE5NDE3._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 December 1951","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","bio":"Janet-Laine Green was born on December 31, 1951 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
