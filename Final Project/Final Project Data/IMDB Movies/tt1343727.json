His first acting role was when he was 8 -- he had a line on a television series. However, he did not act again until after high school. He was offered a role in the NZ soap opera Shortland Street (1992) as he was preparing to attend Victoria University. After appearing on the series for the 1993-1994 season, he attended the university for one year, then left to pursue his acting career. Over the next few years, he landed several theater roles in the Wellington area. Eventually, he moved to Auckland, where a number of guest roles in NZ television followed. One of his first roles was that of a heroin addict in the drama series Shark in the Park (1989). He was in a movie as well, entitled Once in Chunuck Bay (aka Chunuk Bair (1992)). Other television roles followed, including a guest-starring role in the series White Fang (1993).

She was born in Bermuda to parents from Yorkshire, England, where she was raised. She is the daughter John Headey, a police officer, and his wife Sue. Headey is best known for her role as \"Cersei Lannister\" in Game of Thrones (2011) (2011-present) and The Brothers Grimm (2005), Possession (2002), and The Remains of the Day (1993). Headey stars as \"Queen Gorgo\", a heroic Spartan woman in the period film, 300 (2006), by director Zack Snyder. Headey was born in Hamilton, Bermuda, to British parents Sue and John Headey. Her father, a Yorkshire police cadet, was sent to Bermuda shortly before her birth. She was raised there, living by the ocean until she was five. Back in England, she was brought up in Yorkshire before moving to London in her teens. Headey had not gone to drama school before she became an actress. At the age of 17, Headey's performance in a one-off show in the company of six school friends caught the attention of a casting agent, who took a photo and asked her to audition. Eventually, Headey was cast in Waterland (1992), which became her big-screen debut. She honed her natural acting talent while filming and also took archery classes and horse training. She also took boxing classes in clubs in south London, where a former boxer had been teaching her to spar. During her film career, spanning over 15 years, Headey has shown her range in a variety of roles, playing characters from Amazon-type warriors and action-minded women in The Cave (2005) and The Brothers Grimm (2005), to a lesbian florist in Imagine Me & You (2005). Headey's film career has taken her all over the world. She was in India for the filming of Le livre de la jungle (1994), then in St. Petersburg, Russia, for filming Onegin (1999), and in Norway for filming of Aberdeen (2000). In 2005 Headey was filming in Romania and in Mexico, then spent four months in Prague, Czech Republic, where a forest was designed and built for filming The Brothers Grimm (2005), with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. During 2006 Headey was in Canada for the filming of 300 (2006), then went to locations in Bulgaria for shooting The Contractor (2007), and Germany and in Czech Republic for the filming of Baron rouge (2008). She also played Gina McVey in the horror thriller The Broken (2008), and Elizabeth in Tell Tale (2009). In addition to her film-work, Heady appeared as Sarah Connor in a TV spin-off of the popular \"Terminator\" film franchise, the FOX's television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008). Outside of her acting profession, Headey continued taking boxing lessons in London. She is a vegetarian and also remains loyal to yoga, which she discovered during her work in India. She has never been back to her birthplace in Bermuda; she shares her time between her homes in London, England, and Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwMjIwNjg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3MDEzMDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372176","name":"Lena Headey","idIMDB":"nm0372176"},"actorId":"nm0372176","character":"Ma-Ma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0241464","main":true},{"actorName":"Tamer Burjaq","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3116102","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tamer Burjaq is known for his work on Dredd (2012), Black Sails (2014) and The Last Face (2016).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3116102","name":"Tamer Burjaq","idIMDB":"nm3116102"},"actorId":"nm3116102","character":"Ma-Ma Bodyguard","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0379806","main":true},{"actorName":"Warrick Grier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340956","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Warrick Grier is known for his work on Dredd (2012), Death Race 2 (2010) and The Bone Snatcher (2003).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340956","name":"Warrick Grier","idIMDB":"nm0340956"},"actorId":"nm0340956","character":"Caleb","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0379807","main":true},{"actorName":"Wood Harris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365445","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDY2NDY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5OTY0OA@@._V1_UY44_CR23,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 October 1969","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Sherwin David Harris","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Harris was born Sherwin David Harris in Chicago, Illinois, to John and Mattie Harris.
