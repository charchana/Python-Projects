William Smith has done it all. He was born on March 24, 1933, in Columbia, Missouri, on Rolling Acres, a Hereford cattle ranch. After losing everything to the dust bowl, the family moved to California. From 1942, when he was eight, through young adulthood, Bill appeared in many movies as an extra (uncredited). After high school, he joined the Air Force and served during the Korean War and flew secret ferret missions over Russia while in the NSA. He studied at the University of Munich, and Syracuse University. He graduated cum laude at UCLA. Bill would go on to become one of Hollywood's best-known character actors, with over 300 TV and movie credits. On TV he played in many westerns (did his own horseback riding), cop and sci-fi shows. He's best remembered for appearing in Batman (1966) as, appropriately, Adonis in the last episode. He was a series regular in Hawaii Five-O (1968), where he played Det. James \"Kimo\" Carew (the episode with Cathy Lee Crosby, \"The Kahuna,\" drew particularly high ratings). On the big screen, Bill is legendary for biker flicks (he does his own motorcycle riding). His first biker flick, Run, Angel, Run! (1969), was shot in 13 days for under $100,000--and made $13 million! This was followed by Angels Die Hard (1970). These early, ground-breaking features defined the genre, and would be imitated endlessly (but never duplicated). In the early 1970s, Bill got into horror films--playing a vampire slayer in Grave of the Vampire (1972)--and science fiction, in the camp classic Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973), where he fought killer insect-women wearing sunglasses. Just about everybody's favorite William Smith movie, though, is Any Which Way You Can (1980), where as a bare-knuckle brawler he had a knock-down, drag-out fight with Clint Eastwood that wrecked about half the town. Tougher than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill played his dad in Conan the Barbarian (1982), and was one of the few actors in the wildly popular, but critically lambasted, youth-oriented Red Dawn (1984) to receive any recognition from critics. He was in what could be called a textbook example of low-budget, campy sci-fi, Hell Comes to Frogtown (1988). Just about everybody who has ever worked with Bill speaks highly of him. He's educated, intelligent and energetic. A true legend in the business, Bill's acting career is still going strong in 2006, well into the 64th year of his career.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzQxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQyOTQ5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0810342","name":"William Smith","nicknames":["Big Bill"],"idIMDB":"nm0810342"},"actorId":"nm0810342","character":"Sheriff","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Denny Dale Bess","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1193840","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4ODY4NDA2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg1NTQ4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 January 1969","placeOfBirth":" La Mirada, California, USA","birthName":"Dennis Dale Bess","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Denny Dale Bess was born on January 8, 1969 in La Mirada, California, USA as Dennis Dale Bess.

She was a child of the streets and victim of much abuse until she accidentally ended up in a featured extra role in Paramount's Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982)! The event changed her life, and she saved enough money to move to New York City and study acting. After many years working with numerous theater companies in off-Broadway plays, she started to land small roles in films. Spike Lee's editor Barry Alexander Brown cast her in a featured role in his first directing effort, Lonely in America (1990). Soon the parts grew bigger and bigger and primarily fell in the fear flick genre. Since then Debbie has starred in dozens of horror movies and has gained cult stardom worldwide. Since 1994, she has acted in various roles in Lloyd Kaufman's Troma Productions, most notably Tromeo and Juliet (1996) and Terror Firmer (1999), as well as many other independent straight-to-DVD horror flicks in lead, supporting and minor parts. Although she is mostly associated with creepy features and thrillers because of her evenly-shaped, dark-haired appearance, she has garnered acclaim for her turns in comedy and drama. She has also co-hosted a number of radio shows in New York City that focused on film and pop culture. Debbie co-hosted and co-produced the radio show Oblique Strategies with Peter Schmedig on WBAI a terrestrial radio station which aired out of NYC from 1994-1996. Debbie also co-hosted and co-produced the Internet radio show Illumination Gallery with Peter Schmedig for Pseudo Radio out of NYC from 1996-1998.
