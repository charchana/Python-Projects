He was born in Muskogee, Ok and raised in the country south of there. He grew up watching local broadcasting shows on the weekends such as Plenty Scary Movies, Creature Feature & Kung Fu Theater, thus starting his life long love of horror movies and martial arts. Larry began singing Buddy Holly & Elvis Presley songs at the age of 2, he was fascinated with music, his mother gave him the alb Led Zeppelin 4 when he was about 4 or 5 years old and his life long affair with music was sealed. Larry's grandparents bought him his first guitar for Christmas when he was 7 and by the age of ten he had started his own band. By the age of 15 he had been in several bands but finally had one that was moving in the right direction, 50/50 was a band that he started with some classmates that began touring all over Oklahoma and Arkansas. By 17 he was a veteran musician on the road with John Pruitt & the Kaktus Band, he continued to play music, write songs, poetry, stories and dream of making it big as a Rockstarr. At 21, when his oldest son was a week old he began touring extensively with an Oklahoma band Desert Wind, after more than a year and hundreds of bars and shows, (opening for Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show, Billy Ray Hoffman & many others) he decided to put his own band together to play his original music that he was writing. Thus his band Ravenmocker was born, short lived, the band lasted little more than 2 years, with Larry bringing an old high school friend along to play bass, J. R. Wolfe AKA Josh Harris. A few years later he would continue playing with Wolfe and form a new band Psycho Deralikts with another old friend Jason Anthony Legg (whom had started kindergarten with Huitt) and a newcomer Noble Lashley. The band was playing many shows and were featured as the upcoming artist in Oklahoma's entertainment magazine The Current, they appeared on a TV show out of Tulsa called Club TV and had opened for many local & regional acts including, Randy Crouch & Flying Horse, The Skillbillies, My Tea Kind, and Skarecrow. They now have a new drummer Aaron Lee and have recently opened for Horror Legend Ari Lehman and his band First Jason. They are just now starting to record a new CD that should be out by winter. Larry recently acted in the new SciFi/Horror movie Crawl or Die and us gearing up to star in part 2 as well. Larry continues to tour with his band Psycho Deralikts and plans to make many new horror movies in the future as both actor and director...","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5789618","name":"Larry Huitt","nicknames":["Scary Larry"],"idIMDB":"nm5789618"},"actorId":"nm5789618","character":"Thumper","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Stephen Crabtree","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5256585","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Matthew Stephen Crabtree is known for his work on Crawl or Die (2014), Screen (2013) and Sparrow (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5256585","name":"Matthew Stephen Crabtree","idIMDB":"nm5256585"},"actorId":"nm5256585","character":"Creature / Special Forces","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Troy Bailey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5256143","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Troy Bailey is known for his work on Crawl or Die (2014) and Screen (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5256143","name":"Troy Bailey","idIMDB":"nm5256143"},"actorId":"nm5256143","character":"Special Forces","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Dixon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4791801","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jonathan Dixon is a producer and actor, known for Crawl or Die (2014), Geekier Things (2017) and Mediatrix (2011).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4791801","name":"Jonathan Dixon","idIMDB":"nm4791801"},"actorId":"nm4791801","character":"Special Forces","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Robbie Huitt","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5789619","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Robbie Huitt yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5789619","name":"Robbie Huitt","idIMDB":"nm5789619"},"actorId":"nm5789619","character":"Special Forces","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeremy Sellers","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4401526","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jeremy Sellers is an actor, known for Crawl or Die (2014), Deprivation (2013) and Screen (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4401526","name":"Jeremy Sellers","idIMDB":"nm4401526"},"actorId":"nm4401526","character":"Special Forces","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"John Stirling","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5131726","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"John Stirling is known for his work on Crawl or Die (2014), Angela (2013) and The Abstract Heart (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5131726","name":"John Stirling","idIMDB":"nm5131726"},"actorId":"nm5131726","character":"Special Forces","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2219210","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2219210","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 30 min (90 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"4.3","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"1,327","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0150950","name":"Backyard Films"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/13 22:38:04"}}
