He was never ashamed of his working-class background, and started his working career as a typographer. But the young man loved poetry, especially the poems of the radical left-wing writer Rudolf Nilsen (1901-1929). He soon became an actor, with his stage debut in 1944 and in films from 1956. For his performance in the movie Scorched Earth (1969) he was honoured at the Moscow International film-festival 1969, and for his leading role in the film Belønningen (1980) (The Reward), he received the Norwegian Filmcritic's Award. In the theater, he played in a great variety of leading roles, at his best as Joe Keller in Miller's: \"All My Sons\" and as Jacques Roux in Weiss': \"Marat/Sade.\" After retiring from the stage, he still played in some short films; vigorously as always!","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0845622","name":"Rolf Søder","idIMDB":"nm0845622"},"actorId":"nm0845622","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt3917466","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3917466","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["34 min"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.6","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"21","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0103690","name":"National Film and Television School (NFTS)"},{"idCompany":"co0122365","name":"Statens Studiesenter for Film"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["family relationships","small town life","old age"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:41:35"}}
