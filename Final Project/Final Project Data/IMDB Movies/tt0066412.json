She began her show-business career as a participant in beauty contests (she won the title of \"Miss Mannequin de la Cote d'Azur\" at age 16 and even won a Miss France beauty contest) and worked as a photo model prior to making her film debut in the comedy Toutes folles de lui (1967). She appeared in such saucy West German sex farces as All Kitties Go for Sweeties (1969) and Sexy Susan Sins Again (1968). With her lustrous and long black hair, lovely and sensuous face, full shapely figure and smoldering screen presence, Edwige soon became a very popular and much sought-after actress in a diverse array of European productions made in Italy, France, Spain and West Germany. she achieved her greatest enduring cult cinema popularity by starring in several superior Italian giallos for director Sergio Martino: Blade of the Ripper (1971), Toutes les couleurs du vice (1972) and Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key (1972) (she was the onetime girlfriend of Martino's producer brother, Luciano Martino). Edwige also acted for Martino in a handful of racy Italian sex comedies and the Italian mini-series Private Crimes (1993). Other noted Italian film directors Fenech has worked for are Mario Bava (5 Dolls for an August Moon (1970)), Giuliano Carnimeo (The Case of the Bloody Iris (1972)), Andrea Bianchi (Strip Nude for Your Killer (1975)), Umberto Lenzi (The Biggest Battle (1978)), Steno (Dottor Jekyll e gentile signora (1979)),Dino Risi (Je suis photogénique (1980)) and Ruggero Deodato (Phantom of Death (1988)). She demonstrated her exceptional range and skill as an actress with enjoyably uninhibited performances in such amusingly bawdy Italian comedic romps as Quel gran pezzo della Ubalda tutta nuda e tutta calda (1972) and La prof donne des leçons particulières (1975). Edwige became a television personality in the 1980s and made frequent appearances on an Italian chat show along with fellow giallo goddess Barbara Bouchet. Moreover, Fenech launched her own fashion line and founded her own film production company, Immagine e Cinema S.r.l., with her son Edwin Fenech (she co-produced the 2004 film The Merchant of Venice (2004) as well as various Italian TV mini-series and made-for-TV features). In the mid-1990s Edwige was engaged to famous Italian industrialist Luca Cordero di Montezemolo. She made a welcome return to acting with a small but funny part as an alluring art class professor in Eli Roth's Hostel: Part II (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MzUwMDA0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc2MjIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0271763","name":"Edwige Fenech","idIMDB":"nm0271763"},"actorId":"nm0271763","character":"Julie Wardh","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Conchita Airoldi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0014808","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Conchita Airoldi is a producer and actress, known for Cemetery Man (1994), Duplicity (2009) and Titus (1999).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0014808","name":"Conchita Airoldi","idIMDB":"nm0014808"},"actorId":"nm0014808","character":"Carol Brandt","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Manuel Gil","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0317813","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 December 1933","placeOfBirth":" Cervera del Río Alhama, Logroño, Spain","birthName":"Manuel Gil Huidobro","bio":"Manuel Gil was born on December 13, 1933 in Cervera del Río Alhama, Logroño, Spain as Manuel Gil Huidobro.

A series of small roles began his career, one of them being from the legendary director Mario Bava with Planet of Vampires. With his strong, piercing eyes and striking look, Rassimov was often cast as villains, from Nazi soldiers, to tough guys, to murder suspects. Rassimov also occasionally played good guys and saw it as a novelty item from his bad guy roles. From playing a police detective, an archeologist, and even a psychiatrist in Mario Bava's last theatrical movie, Beyond the Door II (1977). He was most often seen as a male stalwart of the Italian cannibal films in acting alongside Me Me Lai in three of them, most notably being _Jungle Holocaust (1977)_. By 1987, Rassimov more or less retired from acting and lived in a villa north of Rome with his wife and teenage daughter. He worked as the director of a publishing house for comic books and novels until his death in 2003.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0711501","name":"Ivan Rassimov","idIMDB":"nm0711501"},"actorId":"nm0711501","character":"Jean","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alberto de Mendoza","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0210274","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEzZWJiM2UtZmYxNi00MzVhLThmMTQtMWE3MDdiMjFhZmFiL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0ODkwMTU@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 January 1923","placeOfBirth":" Buenos Aires, Argentina","birthName":"Alberto Manuel Rodríguez Gallego Gonzáles de Mendoza","bio":"Alberto de Mendoza was born on January 21, 1923 in Buenos Aires, Argentina as Alberto Manuel Rodríguez Gallego Gonzáles de Mendoza.
