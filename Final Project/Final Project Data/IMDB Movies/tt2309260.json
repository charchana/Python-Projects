Those dreams were sidelined, however, when he suffered a broken pelvis in a game and it failed to heal correctly. It was then that his mother suggested he try acting. For the remainder of his high school career, he had the lead in many of his school's plays. Owasso High School has a well respected theatre program and he learned not just acting, but how to handle his art in a professional manner. While his dream of winning a state championship in football eluded him, he did win the state championship in debate. After graduating with honors, Reese set his sights on a career as a professional actor and attended DePaul University in Chicago where he also took classes at the city's famed SECOND CITY Improvisational Theatre. After a year in the Windy City, the allure of sunnier days, beaches, and film and television parts had him moving west to Hollywood. In a story right out of a Hollywood script, he sold his nice car for an older cheaper one. Then with that money and whatever he could fit in the little car and drove west to Hollywood, where he quickly found work in student and other short films. Then, responding to an ad seeking actors for a low budget horror movie, he landed the role of Reese Hauser in THE GALLOWS. As only happens in Hollywood, the little picture caught the eye of New Line Cinema and producer Jason Blum and THE GALLOWS opened domestically in wide release on July 10, 2015 and has gone on to gross over 43 million dollars worldwide. Since then, the actor has fielded numerous offers and has appeared in the psychological thriller FOG CITY and the syfy adventure CAR 86. He has several feature films line up for 2016. Reese splits his time between his home in Owasso and Hollywood.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2FjNzllNDItNDE3OS00Y2EzLWE0NmItMjJmMzMyM2E5ODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzUyMjUwMDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3790547","name":"Reese Mishler","idIMDB":"nm3790547"},"actorId":"nm3790547","character":"Reese Houser","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Pfeifer Brown","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6018502","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1Njg2NzIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0MzAyNjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Pfeifer Brown is an actress, known for The Gallows (2015), Deep Inner Stillness and Trace (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1Njg2NzIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0MzAyNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6018502","name":"Pfeifer Brown","idIMDB":"nm6018502"},"actorId":"nm6018502","character":"Pfeifer Ross","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryan Shoos","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4090362","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAwNzA2MDk0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjEwNTA0ODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Ryan Shoos is known for his work on The Gallows (2015), Bastard (2015) and Pretty Little Liars (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAwNzA2MDk0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjEwNTA0ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4090362","name":"Ryan Shoos","idIMDB":"nm4090362"},"actorId":"nm4090362","character":"Ryan Shoos","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cassidy Gifford","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2258992","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OTc1MzczOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg1NzkxNjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 August 1993","placeOfBirth":" Greenwich, Connecticut, USA","birthName":"Cassidy Erin Gifford","bio":"Cassidy Gifford was born on August 2, 1993 in Greenwich, Connecticut, USA as Cassidy Erin Gifford.
