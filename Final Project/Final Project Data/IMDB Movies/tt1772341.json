With an astonishing range of roles already under his belt, John C. Reilly has played an eclectic host of rich characters to great effect over the years, from seedy ne'er-do-wells, to lovable, good-natured schlepps. The fifth of six children, John Christopher Reilly was born in Chicago, to a father of mostly Irish descent, and a Lithuanian-American mother, and was brought up on Chicago's tough Southwest territory. His father, also named John, ran an industrial linen supply company business. On the amateur stage from age eight, Reilly trained at the Goodman School of Drama and eventually became a member of Chicago's renowned Steppenwolf Theatre. His film break came with a small role in the Vietnam War drama Casualties of War (1989), wherein Brian De Palma liked his work so much during the early stages that he recast him in a major role by the start of shooting as a soldier bent on rape. Reilly gained momentum throughout the 1990s and showed his dazzling stretch of talent in such films as Days of Thunder (1990), Shadows and Fog (1991), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) and The River Wild (1994). He became a major stock player in director Paul Thomas Anderson's films, while finding some of his best roles in Hard Eight (1996) as a compulsive gambler, Boogie Nights (1997) in which he played a narcissistic porn star, and in Magnolia (1999) as a compassionate policeman. He went on to earn further critical points for his role of the soldier sent to the front lines in Terrence Malick's war epic The Thin Red Line (1998). On stage, Reilly has wowed audiences in \"The Grapes of Wrath\" on Broadway, \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"Othello\" at Steppenwolf, and earned an Outer Critics Circle Award and Tony nomination for \"True West\" alongside another impeccable character player Philip Seymour Hoffman. Reilly finally received the film recognition he deserved in 2002 with a slew of choice, high-profile parts in The Hours (2002), The Good Girl (2002), Gangs of New York (2002), and especially Chicago (2002) as the put-upon husband, Amos Hart, who is played for a patsy by murderous wife Roxie (Renée Zellweger). For this last part, he received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. Since then his stock has risen considerably, and he has further widened his cinematic repertoire, appearing in everything from dramatic roles - We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011), Aviator (2004) and Carnage (2011) - to broader comic turns - Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (2007), Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), Step Brothers (2008), Cyrus (2010) and Cedar Rapids (2011). Most recently, he has voiced the lead in Disney's animated smash Wreck-It Ralph (2012). Reilly is married to producer Alison Dickey.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4MDEzMDkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzNzcy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000604","name":"John C.

During this time, Alan was also an active member of the Delta Psi Omega fraternity. After leaving LMJC, Alan went on to study at the prestigious Juilliard conservatory but left in 1996 before earning a degree. After a number of smaller stage productions and a small role in the movie Patch Adams (1998), Alan landed his first Broadway role in 1999 with \"Epic Proportions.\" He quickly became a sought-after comedic actor, with roles in such films as 28 Days (2000) and A Knight's Tale (2001). In 2002, Alan got the role of Wash, the wise-cracking pilot of Serenity on the short-lived series Firefly (2002). Although it lasted only eleven episodes, this may be Alan's most well-known and best-loved role. No other networks would buy the failed series, but Universal Pictures began courting creator Joss Whedon to produce a big-screen version of the series. While awaiting the final news of Firefly's fate, Alan played the beloved Steve the Pirate in the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) and the voice of the robot Sonny in I, Robot (2004). In 2005, Alan finally reprised the role of Wash in Serenity (2005), the feature-film version of the series Firefly.

He is the son of Helen (Lynch) and Joseph Lo Truglio, and is of Italian and Irish descent. His childhood revolved around collecting Mad magazines, shooting horror movies on a Super 8, fishing in his backyard canal, and drawing homemade comics. He graduated Coconut Creek High School in 1988, where he was a member of Thespian troupe 2617, and there, along with classmate Russell Scherker, in category Duo Scene at Thespian VII district competition at Santaluces High School, snagged the coveted \"Critic's Choice\". The scene performed: the screwball, banter-laden opening scene of \"Say Goodnight, Gracie\". He attended NYU Film school where he met his future colleagues and co-founded the cult sketch group, \"The State\". Also during this time, he indulged in \"Jagger-Induced, Midnight Sidewalk-Stencil Missions\". After a short run on MTV, he and his cohorts were pistol-whipped by the realities of network television. After The State's hiatus in 1996, he hunkered down in Hell's Kitchen and immersed himself in commercial, video-game, and TV episodic work. He found a local watering hole, played poker, and trash-talked LA, where, ironically, he would move to 10 years later. Around the millennium, with \"Wet Hot American Summer\" and \"The Station Agent\", independent film work came back into the fray. It was all coming full-circle, the only missing element being a Super 8 camera. Now, he balances writing and producing web series and firebranding its originality over mainstream media with bike rides and matinées. He relishes jumping back and forth between studio and indie flicks. Guinness and Jameson is still his favorite buddy-comedy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTAyMTI4ODQ3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0MjE1OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516266","name":"Joe Lo Truglio","idIMDB":"nm0516266"},"actorId":"nm0516266","character":"Markowski","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0354254","main":true},{"actorName":"Ed O'Neill","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642145","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI2NjcyODk0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMxODc4NzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1946","placeOfBirth":" Youngstown, Ohio, USA","birthName":"Jr. Edward Philip O'Neill","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Ed O'Neill is an American actor best known for playing Al Bundy on Married with Children (1987), the most iconic working class character on television since Archie Bunker. Upon his debut on the world stage in Youngstown, Ohio on April 12, 1946, he was christened Edward Philip O'Neill, Jr. Both his father, Ed, Sr., a steelworker and truck driver, and his social worker mother, the former Ruth Ann Quinlan, were Irish-Americans. A gifted athlete, the 6'1\" O'Neil attended Ohio University on a football scholarship, but transferred after his sophomore year to Youngstown State University, where he played as a defensive lineman. In 1969, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers, but was cut in training camp. (Al Bundy was a former high-school football star constantly reminiscing about his glory days on the high school gridiron. Terry Bradshaw, the Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, twice appeared on \"Married with Children\".) After being cut by the Steelers, O'Neill went back to YSU to join the new theater department. After graduating, he became a social studies teacher at his alma mater, Ursuline High School, before fully committing to acting. He was a member of the company at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the top regional theaters in America. After numerous supporting parts in movies and television, he was cast as the New York City detective Popeye Doyle in the 1986 television movie that was a pilot for a proposed television series. \"Popeye Doyle\" was based on the classic police drama The French Connection (1971), with O'Neil playing the role originated by Gene Hackman). The television movie and O'Neil's performance got good reviews, but it was not picked up as a series. A year later, O'Neill was cast as Al Bundy in the sitcom \"Married with Children\", which debuted on the then-new Fox Network in April 1987. It ran 10 years, until June 1997, and made O'Neil a star. During the production of \"Married with Children\" and after its cancellation, O'Neill appeared in movies, guested on television shows, and made television commercials. The second iconic fictional policeman role that O'Neill took over was Sgt. Joe Friday in his 2003 remake of Jack Webb's classic crime series Dragnet (2003), which appeared on ABC. The network canceled the show during its second season. Since 2009, O'Neill has played Jay Pritchett on the ABC's sitcom Modern Family (2009), for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2011. Since 1986, O'Neil has been married to actress Catherine Rusoff. They have two daughters, Claire and Sophia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI2NjcyODk0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMxODc4NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642145","name":"Ed O'Neill","idIMDB":"nm0642145"},"actorId":"nm0642145","character":"Mr. Litwak","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0354255","main":true},{"actorName":"Dennis Haysbert","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0371660","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNjgyNjE4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI1MjQ4Ng@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 June 1954","placeOfBirth":" San Mateo, California, USA","birthName":"Dennis Dexter Haysbert","height":"6' 5\" (1.96 m)","bio":"Dennis Haysbert was born on June 2, 1954 in San Mateo, California, USA as Dennis Dexter Haysbert.

She retired when the dance teacher was arrested on a morals charge for \"dating\" the tall and lissome, yet underage, star dancer in the troupe. That girl's big number culminated with a back-bend where Edie drank a soda upside down (of course). Edie has a Master of Science from Syracuse and taught radio at the University of Missouri/Kansas City for eight years. There she re-entered the entertainment field as a DJ, newswoman and producer for the NPR affiliate KCUR-FM. Her proudest moment was portraying John Ehrlichman in Conversation 26 of the NPR national broadcast of the Nixon Tape Transcripts. Thus did Edie contribute to the peaceful overthrow of the government of an unindicted co-conspirator. Her career-long devotion to satirical improvisation included an impressive tenure with The Groundlings. She went on to create original characters, performed on the daytime The David Letterman Show (1980): Mrs. Marv Mendenhall, Dot Duncan, Whirly June Pickens, Officer Jeanelle Archer, 105-year-old Edie, etc. TV has been a home to many of Edie's characters--on The Richard Pryor Show (1977); as Lucille Tarlek, wife of mega-obnoxious ad salesman Herb Tarlek on WKRP in Cincinnati (1978); and as Mrs. Poole on Valerie (1986). Her movie career growth paralleled her ten years with The Groundlings. Her first film was the teen horror favorite Carrie (1976). She did several John Hughes films, including Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), She's Having a Baby (1988) and _Curly Sue (1990)_. Offbeat cult faves are Eating Raoul (1982), Elvira: Mistress of the Dark (1988), HBO's The Pee Wee Herman Show (1981) and Martin Mull's The History of White People in America (1985).

His mother was a recipient of welfare with a degree in Chicano studies, his dad was a psychologist, and he got where he is today, he says, in spite of them. After Adam graduated from North Hollywood High School, he spent a very short time in junior college. After dropping out, he worked a memorable stint as a carpet cleaner. Later in life, Adam worked as a skilled carpenter/builder, becoming a boxing trainer in his free time. Adam's early studies in entertainment were with The Groundlings, an improv group, which has produced a number of other famous comedic personalities. When Jimmy Kimmel was challenged to a boxing match at L.A. radio station KROQ in 1994, Adam was his trainer. Jimmy helped Adam get a job on KROQ's \"Kevin and Bean Morning Show.\" It was on KROQ that Dr. Drew (Drew Pinsky, the original and current host of the Loveline radio show) heard Adam and liked his style. In 1995, Drew gave Adam the job of co-hosting Loveline on the radio. It was at this time that Loveline became syndicated nationally in the USA. In 1996, Loveline (1996), along with Adam and Drew, came to television on MTV. It was a popular late-night, hour-long show, which Adam and Drew co-hosted variously with Diane Farr, Catherine McCord, Laura Kightlinger, and Kris McGaha. The MTV show ran for over four years, ending in 2000, finally bowing out after what is regarded as a very successful run by MTV standards. Adam and Dr. Drew continued to co-host Loveline nightly on a syndicated national radio network, often joined on-air by celebrity guests, until 2005, when Adam left the show. Adam also writes for and occasionally guests on Jimmy Kimmel Live! (2003). Having created and worked on The Man Show (1999) and Crank Yankers (2002) with Jimmy and Daniel Kellison, Adam is putting his talents to use on more comedic ventures.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MDQwMDY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTc3NzYz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004805","name":"Adam
