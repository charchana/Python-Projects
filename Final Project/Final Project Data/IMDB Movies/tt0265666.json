He is of Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry, partly by way of Canada, where his mother was born. After several moves, his family settled in Danville, Illinois. Gene grew up in a broken home, which he left at the age of sixteen for a hitch with the US Marines. Moving to New York after being discharged, he worked in a number of menial jobs before studying journalism and television production on the G.I. Bill at the University of Illinois. Hackman would be over 30 years old when he finally decided to take his chance at acting by enrolling at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. Legend says that Hackman and friend Dustin Hoffman were voted \"least likely to succeed.\" Hackman next moved back to New York, where he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway. In 1964 he was cast as the young suitor in the Broadway play \"Any Wednesday.\" This role would lead to him being cast in the small role of Norman in Lilith (1964), starring Warren Beatty. When Beatty was casting for Bonnie and Clyde (1967), he cast Hackman as Buck Barrow, Clyde Barrow's brother. That role earned Hackman a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, an award for which he would again be nominated in I Never Sang for My Father (1970). In 1972 he won the Oscar for his role as Detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in The French Connection (1971). At 40 years old Hackman was a Hollywood star whose work would rise to new heights with Night Moves (1975) and Bite the Bullet (1975), or fall to new depths with The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and Eureka (1983). Hackman is a versatile actor who can play comedy (the blind man in Young Frankenstein (1974)) or villainy (the evil Lex Luthor in Superman (1978)). He is the doctor who puts his work above people in Extreme Measures (1996) and the captain on the edge of nuclear destruction in Crimson Tide (1995). After initially turning down the role of Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven (1992), Hackman finally accepted it, as its different slant on the western interested him. For his performance he won the Oscar and Golden Globe and decided that he wasn't tired of westerns after all. He has since appeared in Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), Wyatt Earp (1994), and Mort ou vif (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5Njk0NDQ4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjA0Mzc1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000432","name":"Gene Hackman","idIMDB":"nm0000432"},"actorId":"nm0000432","character":"Royal Tenenbaum","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005676","main":true},{"actorName":"Anjelica Huston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001378","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNTE1MTAyNDReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDk5NDI0Mjc@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 July 1951","placeOfBirth":" Santa Monica, California, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Anjelica Huston was born on July 8, 1951 in Santa Monica, California, to prima ballerina Enrica \"Ricki\" (Soma) and director and actor John Huston. Her mother, who was from New York, was of Italian descent, and her father had English, Scottish, and Scots-Irish ancestry. Huston spent most of her childhood overseas, in Ireland and England, and in 1969 first dipped her toe into the acting profession, taking a few small roles in her father's movies. However, in that year her mother died in a car accident, at 39, and Huston relocated to the United States, where the tall, exotically beautiful young woman modeled for several years. While modeling, Huston had a few more small film roles, but decided to focus more on movies in the early 1980s. She prepared herself by reaching out to acting coach Peggy Feury and began to get roles. The first notable part was in Bob Rafelson's remake of the classic noir movie The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981) (in which Jack Nicholson, with whom Huston was living at the time, was the star). After a few more years of on-again, off-again supporting work, her father perfectly cast her as calculating, imperious Maerose, the daughter of a Mafia don whose love is scorned by a hit man (Nicholson again) in his film adaptation of Richard Condon's Mafia-satire novel Prizzi's Honor (1985). Huston won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, making her the first person in Academy Award history to win an Oscar when a parent and a grandparent (her father and grandfather Walter Huston) had also won one. Huston thereafter worked prolifically, including notable roles in Francis Ford Coppola's -Gardens of Stone (1987), Barry Sonnenfeld's film versions of the Charles Addams cartoons The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993), in which she portrayed Addams matriarch Morticia, Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004). Probably her finest performance on-screen, however, was as Lilly, the veteran, iron-willed con artist in Stephen Frears' The Grifters (1990), for which she received another Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress. A sentimental favorite is her performance as the lead in her father's final film, an adaptation of James Joyce's The Dead (1987) -- with her many years of residence in Ireland, Huston's Irish accent in the film is authentic. Endowed with her father's great height and personal boldness, and her mother's beauty and aristocratic nose, Huston certainly cuts an imposing figure, and brings great confidence and authority to her performances. She clearly takes her craft seriously and has come into her own as a strong actress, emerging from under the shadow of her father, who passed away in 1987. Huston married the sculptor Robert Graham in 1992, The couple lived in the Los Angeles area before Graham's death in 2008.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNTE1MTAyNDReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDk5NDI0Mjc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001378","name":"Anjelica Huston","nicknames":["Angel","Anjel"],"idIMDB":"nm0001378"},"actorId":"nm0001378","character":"Etheline Tenenbaum","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005677","main":true},{"actorName":"Ben Stiller","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001774","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDc3NDkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyNTQwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Benjamin Edward Meara Stiller was born on November 30, 1965, in New York City, New York, to legendary comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. His father is of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent, and his mother was of Irish ancestry (she converted to Judaism). It's not surprising that Ben has followed in his family's footsteps: his parents made no real effort to keep their son away from the Hollywood lifestyle and he grew up among the stars, wondering just why his parents were so popular. At a young age, he and his sister Amy Stiller would perform plays at home, wearing Amy's tights to perform Shakespeare. Ben also picked up an interest in being on the other side of the camera and, at age 10, began shooting films on his Super 8 camera. The plots were always simple: someone would pick on the shy, awkward Stiller...and then he would always get his revenge. This desire for revenge on the popular, good-looking people may have motivated his teen-angst opus Reality Bites (1994) later in his career. He both directed and performed in the film, which costarred Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke. Before he even got his start in Hollywood, Ben put in several consistently solid years in the theater. After dropping out of UCLA, he performed in the Tony Award winner, \"The House of Blue Leaves\". While working on the play, Stiller shot a short spoof of The Color of Money (1986) starring him (in the Tom Cruise role) and his American Playhouse: The House of Blue Leaves (1987) costar John Mahoney (in the Paul Newman role). The short film was so funny that Lorne Michaels purchased it and aired it on Saturday Night Live (1975). This led to Ben spending a year on the show in 1989. Ben made his big screen debut in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun (1987) in 1987. Demonstrating early on the multifaceted tone his career would take, he soon stepped behind the camera to direct Back to Brooklyn for MTV. The network was impressed and gave Stiller his own show, The Ben Stiller Show (1992). He recruited fellow offbeat comedians Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick and created a bitingly satirical show. MTV ended up passing on it, but it was picked up by Fox. Unfortunately, the show was a ratings miss. Stiller was soon out of work, although he did have the satisfaction of picking up an Emmy for the show after its cancellation. For a while, Ben had to settle for guest appearance work. While he was doing this, he saved up his cash and in the end was able to scrape enough together to make Reality Bites (1994), now a cult classic which is looked upon favorably by the generation it depicted. Ben continued to work steadily for a time, particularly in independent productions where he was more at ease. However, he never quite managed to catch a big break. His first big budget directing job was Jim Carrey's The Cable Guy (1996). Although many critics were impressed, Jim Carrey's fans were not. In 1998, There's Something About Mary (1998) had propelled Ben into the mainstream spotlight. With his wince-inducing turn in the Farrelly brothers' gross-out film, Ben really \"struck a nerve\" with mainstream America. Ben has starred in such hit movies as Keeping the Faith (2000) and Meet the Parents (2000). Ben excels at cerebral comedy, but he knows how to get down and lowbrow when he needs to, making him one of America's most popular performers.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDc3NDkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyNTQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001774","name":"Ben Stiller","idIMDB":"nm0001774"},"actorId":"nm0001774","character":"Chas Tenenbaum","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005672","main":true},{"actorName":"Gwyneth Paltrow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000569","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIxOTQ1NTU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ4MDY0Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 September 1972","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Gwyneth Kate Paltrow","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"A tall, wafer thin, delicate beauty, Gwyneth Kate Paltrow was born in Los Angeles, the daughter of noted producer and director Bruce Paltrow and Tony award-winning actress Blythe Danner. Her father was from a Jewish family, while her mother has German, and some English and Irish, ancestry. When Gwyneth was eleven, the family moved to Massachusetts, where her father began working in summer stock productions in the Berkshires. It was here that she received her early acting training under the tutelage of her parents. She graduated from the all-girls Spence School in New York City and moved to California where she attended the UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Art History. She soon quit, realizing it was not her passion. She made her film debut with a small part in Shout (1991) and for the next five years had featured roles in a mixed bag of film fare that included Flesh and Bone (1993); Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994); Se7en (1995); Jefferson in Paris (1995); Moonlight and Valentino (1995); and The Pallbearer (1996). It was her performance in the title role of Emma Woodhouse in Emma (1996) that led to her being offered the role of Viola in Shakespeare in Love (1998), for which she was awarded the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She broke her much publicized engagement to actor Brad Pitt in 1997 citing as the reason the fact that neither she nor Pitt felt that they could pursue their respective careers and at the same time maintain a happy marriage. They remain good friends. Since then, her roles have included The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Shallow Hal (2001), Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004), Iron Man (2008), Two Lovers (2008), and Country Strong (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIxOTQ1NTU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ4MDY0Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000569","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow","nicknames":["Gwynnie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000569"},"actorId":"nm0000569","character":"Margot Tenenbaum","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005675","main":true},{"actorName":"Luke Wilson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005561","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3MjYxNDk4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ5OTQzMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 September 1971","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","birthName":"Luke Cunningham Wilson","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Handsome Texan Luke Cunningham Wilson was born in Dallas in 1971, to Irish-American parents originally from Massachusetts. The son of Laura (Cunningham), a photographer, and Robert Andrew Wilson, an advertising executive, he was raised with two brothers, Owen Wilson (the middle one) and Andrew Wilson (the eldest one). The three would all go on to make their careers in film, with Luke Wilson discovering his love of acting while a student at Occidental College. In 1993, the brothers Wilson collaborated with Wes Anderson to make Bottle Rocket (1994), which was initially a 13-minute short. The gleefully optimistic story of three Texans who aspire to become successful thieves, Bottle Rocket (1994) premiered at the 1993 Sundance Festival, where it attracted the attention of director James L. Brooks. With Brooks' help, the short became a full-length feature film released in 1996 under the same name, Bottle Rocket (1996). Afterwards, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson and the same year, Wilson also appeared in the coming-of-age drama Telling Lies in America (1997). After large roles in three 1998 comedies, Best Men (1997), Bongwater (1998), and Home Fries (1998) (the latter two co-starring Drew Barrymore), Wilson went on to star in another three comedies the following year. The first, Dog Park (1998), was a Canadian film directed by The Kids in the Hall (1988) alum Bruce McCulloch and featured Wilson as one of a group of twenty-something's undergoing the trials and tribulations of love. Blue Streak (1999) starred the actor as the sidekick of robber-turned-policeman Martin Lawrence, while Kill the Man (1999) (which premiered at the 1999 Sundance Festival) cast him as the owner of a small copy centre competing with a large chain store across the street. Though he would stick closely to comedy through 2001 with roles in Charlie's Angels (2000) and Legally Blonde (2001), Wilson took a turn for the sinister in the thrillers Bad Seed (2000) and Soul Survivors (2001) before reteaming with his brother Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson to give one of his most memorable performances as Richie in The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). In 2003, Wilson reprised two past roles, appearing in both Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde (2003). That same year, he also scored a hit as one of the stars of Todd Phillips' Old School (2003). The year 2004 saw Wilson embark on The Wendell Baker Story (2005), a film he starred in, co-directed with brother Andrew Wilson. Although he made his film debut in the acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket (1996), he initially got more recognition for his real-life role as Drew Barrymore's boyfriend than for his acting. Fortunately for Wilson, his onscreen talents outlasted his relationship with Barrymore, and he has enjoyed steady employment and increasing visibility through substantial roles in a number of films","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3MjYxNDk4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ5OTQzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005561","name":"Luke Wilson","nicknames":["One-Take Wilson"],"idIMDB":"nm0005561"},"actorId":"nm0005561","character":"Richie Tenenbaum","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005674","main":true},{"actorName":"Owen Wilson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005562","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMzQ4ODYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAwMTc2NQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 November 1968","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","birthName":"Owen Cunningham Wilson","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Self-proclaimed troublemaker Owen Wilson was born in Dallas, to Irish-American parents originally from Massachusetts.

Expelled from St. Mark's School of Texas (Dallas, TX) in the tenth grade, Wilson finished his sophomore year at Thomas Jefferson School and then headed to a military academy in New Mexico. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he met his future mentor and friend, Wes Anderson. They wrote a screenplay, Bottle Rocket (1996), and sent it to their family friend, screenwriter L.M. Kit Carson, who sent it to producer Polly Platt, who gave it to James L. Brooks, who gave the Texans $5 million dollars to make it into a feature film. Despite critical praise, Bottle Rocket (1996) only grossed one million dollars. After making the film, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson. Fairly quickly, Owen found himself acting in a series of big budget films, such as The Cable Guy (1996), Hantise (1999), Anaconda (1997) and Breakfast of Champions (1999). This led to more work, such as Shanghai Noon (2000), Meet the Parents (2000) and Behind Enemy Lines (2001). He's known not only for his nose, which has been broken several times, but also for his 'free wheeling ways' with a script.

He played sports and did some acting while in that school, but in his words, mostly \"screwed off.\" He enrolled at Regis College in Denver to study pre-med but dropped out after being arrested for marijuana possession. He then joined the National Lampoon Radio Hour with fellow members Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, and John Belushi.

Glover was born in San Francisco, California, to Carrie (Hunley) and James Glover, postal workers who were also active in civil rights. Glover trained at the Black Actors' Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater. It was his Broadway debut in Fugard's Master Harold...and the Boys, which brought him to national recognition and led director Robert Benton to cast Glover in his first leading role in 1984's Oscar®-nominated Best Picture Places in the Heart. The following year, Glover starred in two more Best Picture nominees: Peter Weir's Witness and Steven Spielberg's The Color Purple. In 1987, Glover partnered with Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon film and went on to star in three hugely successful Lethal Weapon sequels. Glover has also invested his talents in more personal projects, including the award-winning To Sleep With Anger, which he executive produced and for which he won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor; Bopha!; Manderlay; Missing in America; and the film version of Athol Fugard's play Boesman and Lena. On the small screen, Glover won an Image Award and a Cable ACE Award and earned an Emmy nomination for his performance in the title role of the HBO movie Mandela. He has also received Emmy nominations for his work in the acclaimed miniseries Lonesome Dove and the telefilm Freedom Song. As a director, he earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for Showtime's Just a Dream.

He made his movie debut in Cassavetes' first film, Shadows (1959), on which he also served as associate producer. Cassel's early career was tied to Cassavetes, who himself had a flourishing career as an actor on television and in major Hollywood productions in addition to becoming, arguably, the first great independent movie director after the collapse of the studio system in the late 1950s/early 1960s. As for Cassel, after his uncredited role in \"Shadows,\" he co-starred with Cassavetes in The Webster Boy (1962) and Too Late Blues (1961) before winding up in support of his friend in Don Siegel's The Killers (1964), a movie shot for TV that had to be released theatrically due to its heightened violence (it was also Ronald Reagan's last movie). Cassel primarily made his living on TV in the 1960s, frequently typecast as beatniks and hippies. He had a supporting role in the Cassavetes-directed episode \"A Pair of Boots\" (1962) for The Lloyd Bridges Show (1962) as well as appearing on such popular programs as 12 O'Clock High (1964), Combat! (1962) and The F.B.I. (1965) before scoring with his aging hippie in \"Faces\" at the end of that tumultuous decade. Along with \"Shadows,\" \"Faces\" remains his favorite Cassavettes film. In addition to acting, Cassel was also a crew member on the film, as the technical staff numbered all of seven. He helped shoot the film as a second cameraman, as well as adjusting the lighting. As the film was financed by Cassavettes himself, there were no union regulations to deal with, nor a studio schedule to keep. Several of Cassavettes' films were shot in continuity, so the actors could develop a character in sequence--similar to stage acting--rather than the traditional method of film making, which is shot out of sequence. Cassel has stated that this technique enhanced the success of his works by eliminating the \"fourth wall\" between the audience and the actors. He believes that acting tells the film's story, not the images and that what is important is how the audience relates to the characters on screen. As their careers matured, Cassel also co-starred with Cassavetes in two TV movies, Nightside (1973) and Nightside (1973) and appeared in supporting roles in three more Cassavetes-directed films: The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976), Opening Night (1977) and Love Streams (1984). In addition to appearing in studio films, Cassel has remained prominent in the American independent film community since the death of his friend and collaborator. He contributed a cameo appearance in the directorial debut of Steve Buscemi (with whom he appeared as a co-star in the black comedy In the Soup (1992)), Trees Lounge (1996), and has appeared in three films by Wes Anderson: Rushmore (1998), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004). Cassel is prized by independent directors for two things: his positive nature, and his (perhaps) facetious declaration that he'd be in any independent film for the price of a plane ticket if he liked the script.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NzE3MjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzgyMzkz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001025","name":"Seymour Cassel","idIMDB":"nm0001025"},"actorId":"nm0001025","character":"Dusty","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0087345","main":true},{"actorName":"Kumar Pallana","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0657785","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1Nzk3MjQ5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA1MDQxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 December 1918","placeOfBirth":" Indore, Indore State, Central India Agency, British India","birthName":"Kumar Vallabhdas Pallana","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Kumar Pallana was born on December 23, 1918 in Indore, Indore State, Central India Agency, British India as Kumar Vallabhdas Pallana.

Alexander Rae Baldwin III is the son of Carol Newcomb (Martineau) and Alexander Rae Baldwin, Jr., who was a high school teacher and football coach. He is of English, Irish, French, Scottish, and German descent. Alec burst onto the TV scene in the early 1980s with appearances on several series, including The Doctors (1963) and Knots Landing (1979), before scoring feature film roles in Forever, Lulu (1987), Beetlejuice (1988), Working Girl (1988), Married to the Mob (1988) and Talk Radio (1988). In 1990, Baldwin appeared in the first on-screen adaptation of the \"Jack Ryan\" character created by mega-selling espionage author, Tom Clancy. The film, The Hunt for Red October (1990), was a box office and critical success, with Baldwin appearing alongside icy Sean Connery. Unfortunately, Baldwin fell out with Paramount Studios over future scripts for \"Jack Ryan\", and subsequent Ryan roles went to Harrison Ford. Baldwin instead went to Broadway to perform \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", garnering a Tony nomination for his portrayal of \"Stanley Kowalski\" (he would reprise the role in a 1995 TV adaptation). Baldwin won over critics as a lowlife thief pursued by dogged cop Fred Ward in Miami Blues (1990), met his future wife Kim Basinger while filming the Neil Simon comedy, The Marrying Man (1991), starred in the film adaptation of the play, Prelude to a Kiss (1992) (in which he starred off-Broadway), and made an indelible ten-minute cameo as a hard-nosed real estate executive laying down the law in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He also made a similar tour-de-force monologue in the thriller, Malice (1993), as a doctor defending his practices, in which he stated, \"Let me tell you something: I am God\". Demand for Baldwin's talents in the 1990s saw more scripts swiftly come his way, and he starred alongside his then-wife, Kim Basinger, in a remake of the Steve McQueen action flick, The Getaway (1994), brought to life the famous comic strip character, The Shadow (1994), and starred as an assistant district attorney in the civil rights drama, Ghosts of Mississippi (1996). Baldwin's distinctive vocal talents then saw him voice US-aired episodes of the highly popular UK children's show, Thomas & Friends (1984), plus later voice-only contributions to other animated/children's shows, including Clerks (2000), Cats & Dogs (2001), Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) and The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004). In the early 2000s, Baldwin and Basinger endured an acrimonious break-up that quickly became tabloid fodder but, while his divorce was high-profile, Baldwin excelled in a number of lower-profile supporting roles in a variety of films, including Séquences et conséquences (2000), Pearl Harbor (2001), The Cooler (2003) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor), Aviator (2004), Along Came Polly (2004) and The Departed (2006). As he was excelling as a consummate character actor, Baldwin found a second career in television comedy. Already known for his comedic turns hosting Saturday Night Live (1975), he essayed an extended guest role on Will & Grace (1998) in 2005 before taking on what would arguably become his most famous role, that of network executive \"Jack Donaghy\", opposite Tina Fey in the highly-acclaimed sitcom, 30 Rock (2006). The role brought Baldwin two Emmy Awards, three Golden Globes, and an unprecedented six Screen Actors Guild Awards (not including cast wins). Continuing to appear in films as 30 Rock (2006) wrapped up its final season, Baldwin remarried in 2012 to Hilaria Baldwin (aka Hilaria Lynn Thomas), and is rumored to be considering political office.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1Njg4MzY3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY3MjE3NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000285","name":"Alec Baldwin","idIMDB":"nm0000285"},"actorId":"nm0000285","character":"Narrator","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Grant Rosenmeyer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742655","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NDQ5MzIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ1MDA4NzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 July 1991","placeOfBirth":" Manhasset, New York, USA","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Grant Rosenmeyer was born on July 3rd, 1991 in Manhasset, New York.

He had to leave after four months to make his film debut in Wes Anderson's modern classic, The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), opposite Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller, along with the rest of the stellar cast. His next film was the famous \"Jewxploitation\" film, The Hebrew Hammer (2003), opposite Adam Goldberg and Andy Dick. Rosenmeyer then booked Fox's Oliver Beene (2003), as the title role, earning him a great deal of exposure.
