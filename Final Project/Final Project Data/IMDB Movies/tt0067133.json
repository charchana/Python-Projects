To break the case, they recruit Ginger, a young woman from an upper-class family to act as bait for the kidnappers and hopefully lead the police to their hideout. It may sound like a foolproof plan to the police, but Ginger's the one who has to risk it all.","simplePlot":"A rich society girl is recruited to go undercover and expose a drug/blackmail/prostitution ring in her small town.","actors":[{"actorName":"Cheri Caffaro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0128410","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MjMyNDc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkzMzAyMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 April 1945","placeOfBirth":" Miami, Florida, USA","bio":"Slim, shapely and well-tanned blonde bombshell Cheri Caffaro was born in 1945 in Miami, Florida. Caffaro won a \"Lifetime\" magazine Brigitte Bardot lookalike contest when she was a teenager and worked as a model throughout the 60s. Cheri achieved a substantial amount of 70s exploitation cinema notoriety by portraying sexy, resourceful and formidable undercover government agent Ginger McAllister in a delightfully down'n'dirty trio of blithely seedy drive-in soft-core action romps: the supremely scuzzy Ginger (1971), the splendidly sleazy The Abductors (1972), and the pleasingly trashy Girls Are for Loving (1973). The \"Ginger\" pictures were a series of gleefully low-rent affairs with a funky distaff James Bond-type anti-heroine using both her brains and her body to thwart assorted nasty criminals. Caffaro brought a hard, fierce, steely edge and raw, earthy, unbridled sex appeal to the part of Ginger that's alluring and unnerving in equal measure. Cheri was likewise solid and effective as a stuck-up spoiled rich woman in the tawdry A Place Called Today (1972), a tough revolutionary in the fun Savage Sisters (1974), and a cunning, deadly, yet enticing international lady assassin in the entertainingly tacky Too Hot to Handle (1977). Alas, Caffaro's moment in the acting spotlight proved to be fleeting. Cheri went on to co-write and co-produce the hilariously raunchy comedy hoot H.O.T.S. (1979). She also served as an associate producer for the cruddy horror flick The Demons of Ludlow (1983). Her last known credit is supplying a voice for the Extreme Ghostbusters (1997) cartoon TV series. Cheri Caffaro abruptly quit show business and now lives in Los Angeles, where she raises her own honey bees.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MjMyNDc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkzMzAyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0128410","name":"Cheri Caffaro","idIMDB":"nm0128410"},"actorId":"nm0128410","character":"Ginger McAllister","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0249172","main":true},{"actorName":"Duane Tucker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875848","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1948","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"Duane Tucker was born on February 17, 1948 in New York City, New York, USA.

He graduated from teachers' college in 1965 and worked as a teacher in Peekskill and New York City. When he was fired from his teaching job after an altercation with a student, he began working as an escort and tried to establish an acting career. Through one of his clients Culver began a modeling career and appeared in off-Broadway and Broadway productions. He began his adult film career in 1971 in the film Ginger. He next appeared in Casey, playing the title role. From that film and the singer Donovan Culver created his screen name. Also in 1971 Culver appeared in the film that would make him famous, Boys In the Sand. The first adult film to achieve mainstream crossover success, Boys led to talk of Culver's moving into \"legitimate\" film work. It also allowed Culver to build a lucrative career as a high-priced escort, although his growing fame in the adult film world cost him his modeling career as more and more potential employers connected him to \"Casey Donovan\". Culver appeared in the Broadway revival of Captain Brassbound's Conversion with Ingrid Bergman in 1972 and the 1973 Lincoln Center production of The Merchant of Venice. He toured nationally in the play Tubstrip and in 1984 produced and appeared in an unsuccessful revival of the play The Ritz. In 1973 Culver began a relationship with the actor Tom Tryon. They were together until 1977. In 1978 Culver bought a guest house in Florida but the business failed. In 1982 he began writing an advice column, \"Ask Casey\", for Stallion magazine. Culver's health began to deteriorate in 1985 and he died of an AIDS-related illness on August 10, 1987 in Inverness, Florida.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191724","name":"Casey Donovan","idIMDB":"nm0191724"},"actorId":"nm0191724","character":"Rodney","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Ross","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1193156","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"David Ross is an actor and assistant director, known for The Abductors (1972) and Ginger (1971).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1193156","name":"David Ross","idIMDB":"nm1193156"},"actorId":"nm1193156","character":"J.D.","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michele Norris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0635868","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Michele Norris is an actress, known for Ginger (1971) and Sweet Savior (1971).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0635868","name":"Michele Norris","idIMDB":"nm0635868"},"actorId":"nm0635868","character":"Vicki Jennings","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cindy Barnett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055868","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Cindy Barnett is an actress, known for Ginger (1971) and The Cult (1971).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055868","name":"Cindy Barnett","idIMDB":"nm0055868"},"actorId":"nm0055868","character":"Jean Oliver","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0499588","main":true},{"actorName":"Lise Mauer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0560815","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Lise Mauer is an actress, known for Ginger (1971).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0560815","name":"Lise Mauer","idIMDB":"nm0560815"},"actorId":"nm0560815","character":"Elizabeth Anderson / Liz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Linda Susoeff","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0839891","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Linda Susoeff is an actress, known for Ginger (1971).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0839891","name":"Linda Susoeff","idIMDB":"nm0839891"},"actorId":"nm0839891","character":"Cathy Carson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"William Grannel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0335182","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 March 1929","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","bio":"Actor William Grannel was born on March 30, 1929 in Brooklyn, New York.
