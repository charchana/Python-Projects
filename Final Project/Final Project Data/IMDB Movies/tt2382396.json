He is of Italian (father) and Polish, German, and English (mother) descent. Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s. Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career. His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984). In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage (b.1992). In 2004, he married Alice Kim Cage, with whom he has a son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDM4Nzk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwNjExOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115","name":"Nicolas Cage","nicknames":["Nick"],"idIMDB":"nm0000115"},"actorId":"nm0000115","character":"Joe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0405148","main":true},{"actorName":"Tye Sheridan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4446467","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NDA5MTY0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA3MDExOTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 November 1996","placeOfBirth":" Elkhart, Texas, USA","birthName":"Tye Kayle Sheridan","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Having been named one of Variety's 10 Actors to Watch, Tye Sheridan has emerged as one of Hollywood's most sought after young talents. Most recently, he was seen in Bryan Singer's highly anticipated film X-Men: Apocalypse (2016), release on May 27, 2016. He starred as young Cyclops alongside a star studded cast including Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Oscar Isaac and Olivia Munn.

That same year, he was recognized by numerous film critics for his starring role in Jeff Nichol's coming-of-age drama Mud (2012) opposite Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon. He received a 2014 Critics' Choice nomination for Best Young Actor and the cast was honored with the 2014 Robert Altman Award at the Independent Spirit Awards. He had three films at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival: The Stanford Prison Experiment (2015), based on a shocking real-life psychological experiment; Rodrigo Garcia's Last Days in the Desert (2015) co-starring Ewan McGregor and the indie drama Entertainment (2015) starring alongside Michael Cera and John C.
