She is the youngest of three children. She was educated in a convent, where she gained a passion for the arts. She later studied at the National College of Fine Arts in Dublin, but left because she lacked the motivation and thought she would take a year off to think it out. Meanwhile, while sitting in a café with friends, she was approached by a still photographer who asked her if she would be interested to model. Thinking she could use the pocket money, she said yes. Modeling proved to be both fun and lucrative, and very soon she did it professionally. Her modeling contracts led to commercial work, which would take her around the world. One day, a casting director saw her work and suggested she try acting instead. She was sent to London at age 19, where she quickly won an audition to appear in the new James Bond film, A View to a Kill (1985). She so loved acting that she pursued a career in that direction. After her first film, she shot a few TV dramas in London and in Dublin, but her big break came when she was cast as Aryan seductress Dr. Elsa Schneider in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Apparently she made a huge impression on Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who loved her great sense of humor and her Grace Kelly looks. After Indiana Jones, which introduced her to Hollywood and to the United States, she was chosen to replace Cybill Shepherd as spokeswoman for L'Oréal. After that she shot a few B-movies in the United States, but at one point felt she missed Ireland too much, so she went back to Dublin. In 1994, she put her career on hold to spend more time with media heir Gavin O'Reilly, whom she had been dating for two years. In 1996 they married, and later had two children. In 2002, she was asked to cameo in the 'Michael Caine (I)_ comedy The Actors (2003), and there she regained a lust for the movie industry. The following summer, she shot Allan Quatermain et la pierre des ancêtres (2004) with co-star Patrick Swayze, and it's then that the whole ball started rolling again. In 2005, she and her husband divorced and she decided to re-launch her stalled career, but she quickly realized how difficult it was to break into this kind of business for a second time, especially after ten years away from the camera. Recently she appeared in the short film Benjamin's Struggle (2005), directed by newcomer Jamie Breese, and played a role in the well-known British series Waking the Dead (2000). In a recent interview, she said she was thrilled to be acting again, but added that she wasn't willing to accept anything for the sake of working. She is determined to find the right part, but she also wants to do different things: \"I'm fed up playing the nasty Nazi. I'd like to do something quite extreme.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NjI5MTExM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUxNDczMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233145","name":"Alison Doody","idIMDB":"nm0233145"},"actorId":"nm0233145","character":"Susan Taylor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Christopher Ellison","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0255177","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 December 1946","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","bio":"Worked in the Merchant Navy, trained as a Graphic Designer and worked as a minicab driver.

Berkoff was born in Stepney, London in August 1937 and received dramatic arts training in both Paris and London and then moved on to performing with several repertory companies, before he formed the London Theatre Group in 1968. Berkoff had actually been appearing in uncredited roles in UK cinema since 1959, and started to get noticed by casting agents with his performances in Hamlet at Elsinore (1964), Nicholas and Alexandra (1971), A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Barry Lyndon (1975). Mainstream film fans are probably most familiar with Steven Berkoff via his portrayal of a trio of ice cold villains in several big budget Hollywood productions of the 1980s. Firstly, he played a rogue general plotting to launch a war in Europe in Octopussy (1983), then a drug smuggling art dealer out to kill Detroit narcotics officer Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop (1984), and thirdly as a sadistic Russian commando officer torturing Sylvester Stallone in Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). Berkoff continued to contribute scintillating performances and was quite memorable as Adolf Hitler in War and Remembrance (1988), The Krays (1990) and the haunting The Tell-Tale Heart (1991). Further villainous roles followed for the steely Berkoff in Fair Game (1995) and the Jean-Claude Van Damme kick flick Legionnaire (1998). He excelled in the camp comedy 9 Dead Gay Guys (2002), played UK crime figure Charlie Richardson Snr. in Charlie (2004) and then appeared in the passionate Greek film about mail order brides simply titled, Les mariées (2004) (\"Brides\"). His screen performances are but one part of the brilliance of Steven Berkoff, as he has additionally built a formidable reputation for his superb craftsmanship in the theatre. Berkoff has written and performed original plays including \"Decadence\", \"Harry's Christmas Lunch\" \"Brighton Beach Scumbags\" and \"Sink the Belgrano\", as well as appearing in productions of \"Hamlet\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Coriolanus\" to rapturous audiences right across the globe. Furthermore, he has authored several highly entertaining books on the theatre and his life including \"The Theatre of Steven Berkoff\", \"Coriolanus in Deutscheland\", \"A Prisoner in Rio\", \"I am Hamlet\" and \"Meditations on Metamorphosis\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3NjM1OTQ5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA4ODgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000925","name":"Steven Berkoff","idIMDB":"nm0000925"},"actorId":"nm0000925","character":"Charlie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Tony Denham","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219070","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Tony Denham is an actor, known for Au nom du père (1993), The Football Factory (2004) and Revolver (2005).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219070","name":"Tony Denham","idIMDB":"nm0219070"},"actorId":"nm0219070","character":"Butch","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0555805","main":true},{"actorName":"Dani Dyer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3669803","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 August 1996","placeOfBirth":" Newham, London, England, UK","birthName":"Dani Charlotte Dyer","bio":"Dani Dyer was born on August 8, 1996 in Newham, London, England as Dani Charlotte Dyer.

A graduate of the world famous Sylvia Young Theatre School, Silva is best known for her long running role as Kelly Windsor in top-rated British television drama Emmerdale (1972), for which the Daily Express described her as \"soap's sexiest star.\" Silva made her screen acting debut opposite Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred in a scene from Doctor Who: Survival: Part Three (1989), which also has its place in history as the last transmitted episode of the original series of Doctor Who (1963). She followed this with guest appearances in popular British television shows such as The Bill (1984), EastEnders (1985) and Mr. Majeika (1988). Adele then joined the cast of Emmerdale (1972) and was at the centre of dozens of dramatic storylines, working with the likes of Patsy Kensit, Patrick Mower and Linda Thorson. During a break from the show she guested in episodes of The Courtroom (2004) and Mile High (2003). She also spent a year of further acting training at the world-renowned Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Shortly after quitting Emmerdale (1972) in 2007, Silva took part - and came second in - hit reality show Hell's Kitchen (2005) with fiery chef Marco Pierre White. The same year she starred opposite Spandau Ballet legend Gary Kemp in the short film Karma Magnet (2008), directed by his brother, Martin Kemp. More recently, Silva appeared in Doghouse (2009) with Danny Dyer, Stephen Graham and Noel Clarke.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0798195","name":"Adele Silva","idIMDB":"nm0798195"},"actorId":"nm0798195","character":"Gemma","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt3157224","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3157224","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 34 min (94 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.0","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"2,752","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0577224","name":"Hereford Films"},{"idCompany":"co0406675","name":"Richwater Films"}]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 04:02:21"}}
