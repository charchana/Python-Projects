Her initial desire to develop theatre for and with children prompted her to seek a career as an actress and a teacher. From 1984 to 1988 she attended the school of acting at Arnhem to become a stage actress. Considering acting \"the language of the heart\", one of the most important things she learned was that the personnel and creative development of an actor are closely knit. Her acting experience ranges from Shakespeare, Sophocles, Strindberg and Chekhov to improvisory clown acts. At the academy, collaboration with fellow students resulted in the very successful theatre group \"De Trust\", directed by Boermans. In 1987 Johanna was asked for a role in the film L'homme qui voulait savoir (1988) (aka \"The Vanishing\"), directed by George Sluizer. This role met international acclaim, winning her the \"Felix Award\" (Best Supporting Actress) in Berlin. Inevitably, her career shifted from the theatre to the cinema. For the past twelve years she has traveled all over the world, acting in different languages and working with renowned directors, such as Robert Altman (Vincent et Théo (1990)), István Szabó (Chère Emma (1992), aka \"Sweet Emma, Dear Bobe\"), Heddy Honigmann (Goodbye (1995) aka \"Goodbye\", for which she won Best Actress at the Locarno International Film Festival) and Bruce Beresford (Paradise Road (1997)). Johanna has also worked with actors such as Glenn Close, Frances McDormand, Isabella Rossellini, Gary Oldman, Tim Roth and Klaus Maria Brandauer. In January 2001 ter Steege played Countess Geschwitz, in the play \"Lulu\", directed by Jonathan Kent, both in the Almeida theatre in London and in Washington.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEzNDM3MDQ4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjQ0Mjgy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0824373","name":"Johanna ter Steege","idIMDB":"nm0824373"},"actorId":"nm0824373","character":"Marianne","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yann Collette","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0171811","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 April 1956","placeOfBirth":" Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes, France","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Yann Collette was born on April 14, 1956 in Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes, France.
