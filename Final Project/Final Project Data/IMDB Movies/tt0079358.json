Nancy got her first big break when she was scouted by director/producer Joseph Kuo who signed her on for an open contract with his Hong Hwa Film studio where Nancy got her break with Kuo's 'Triangular Duel' which was enjoyed by moviegoers in Hong Kong and beyond. Around the same time, Nancy also acted opposite Taiwan industry colleagues Jimmy Wang Yu, Yusuaki Kurata, Chang Yi, Chen Sing and Tien Peng where she also got a chance to put her spunky athleticism into display in such films as 'Chaochow Guy', 'Ma Su Chen', 'The File of Heroes' and 'Black Panther' all giving her box office exposure at an early age. International exposure was the inevitable next step for Nancy where she gravitated into the high-flying world of the Hong Kong film industry where she did a series of high profile titles for Run Run Shaw but it was destined that Nancy would return to her roots in Taiwan where she gained her greatest international exposure after being cast in Joseph Kuo's popular 'Seven Grandmasters', a perennial cult favorite among kung fu aficionados across the globe.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0947457","name":"Nancy Yen","idIMDB":"nm0947457"},"actorId":"nm0947457","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jing Bei","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6163779","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jing Bei is an actor, known for Jade Dagger Ninja (1982).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6163779","name":"Jing Bei","idIMDB":"nm6163779"},"actorId":"nm6163779","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peng-Cheng Chang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2924298","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Peng-Cheng Chang is a production manager and producer, known for Dao hun (1977), Hero of Shanghai (1977) and Dragon of the Swords Man (1978).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2924298","name":"Peng-Cheng Chang","idIMDB":"nm2924298"},"actorId":"nm2924298","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chin Hai Chen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1794912","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Chin Hai Chen is an actor, known for Born invincible (1978), Master of the Flying Guillotine (1976) and 5 Masters of Death (1974).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1794912","name":"Chin Hai Chen","idIMDB":"nm1794912"},"actorId":"nm1794912","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Liang Hsieh Chen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2877123","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Liang Hsieh Chen is an actor, known for Jade Dagger Ninja (1982), The Dream Sword (1979) and Everlasting Chivalry (1980).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2877123","name":"Liang Hsieh Chen","idIMDB":"nm2877123"},"actorId":"nm2877123","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mu Chuan Chen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0160922","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Mu Chuan Chen is known for his work on Jin yi wei (1979), Bloody Monkey Master (1977) and Le Kid face au Lama (1980).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0160922","name":"Mu Chuan Chen","idIMDB":"nm0160922"},"actorId":"nm0160922","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ching-Hsia Chiang","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0156953","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ching-Hsia Chiang is an actress and production manager, known for Revenge of the Shaolin Kid (1978), Wu fung chao yang (1971) and Shen long fei xia (1968).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0156953","name":"Ching-Hsia Chiang","idIMDB":"nm0156953"},"actorId":"nm0156953","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kang Chin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0436340","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 August 1939","placeOfBirth":" Taiwan","height":"6' 10\" (2.08 m)","bio":"Kang Chin was born on August 26, 1939 in Taiwan.
