He was born and raised in Fairfield, the second of three sons. His father, R. James Long, is a Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, and his mother, Wendy Lesniak, is a former Broadway actress. He is of German, Sicilian, and Polish descent. He attended Fairfield Prep, and after graduating, he attended Vassar College. He first really showed his promise as a member of the comedy troupe \"LaughingStock.\" His performing talent garnered favorable notices and he won roles in some independent productions, notably Galaxy Quest (1999). However, he refused to act full time until after he graduated, which he did in 2000. He first gained notice when he played the nervous teenager Warren Cheswick in the TV series Ed (2000). The following year, he starred in the offbeat horror film Jeepers creepers - Le chant du diable (2001). The film, with its ghoulish ending, was a major hit on the horror circuit and raised his profile. He played the boyfriend of Britney Spears in Crossroads (2002), and won a supporting role in the Vince Vaughn comedy Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004). He had high-profile roles in some offbeat independent films, most notably Raising Genius (2004) and Waiting... (2005), and scored commercial success again when he played Lindsay Lohan's boyfriend in Herbie Fully Loaded (2005). He continues to win acclaim and fans. He scored commercial success again with a role in the Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy The Break-Up (2006). He is private about his personal life and does not make a point of attending nightclubs and parties. However, his personal life did get scrutiny in 2008, due to his romance with actress Drew Barrymore that year. In addition to his film appearances, he is a spokesman for the Apple Mac computers, appearing with John Hodgman in its commercials.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNTEwODY4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg0ODMwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0519043","name":"Justin Long","nicknames":["The Mac Guy"],"idIMDB":"nm0519043"},"actorId":"nm0519043","character":"Dell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kayla Servi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5236664","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDUzNDAyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg0MDUyNzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 August 1997","placeOfBirth":" Dallas, Texas, USA","height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Kayla Servi was born on August 12, 1997 in Dallas, Texas, USA.

Emmy's performance in the latter film gained her a Golden Globe nomination. Emmanuelle Grey Rossum was born in New York City, where she was raised by her single mother, Cheryl Rossum, a corporate photographer (she has only met her father a few times). Her mother is of Russian Jewish descent and her father has English and Dutch ancestry. After passing an audition at the Metropolitan Opera when she was 7 years old, Rossum performed in more than 20 operas in six different languages at Lincoln Center, alongside such figures as Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. She was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in \"Carmen.\" She left the opera when she entered her teenage years, as she had grown too tall to perform as a child. Emmy also appeared in a Carnegie Hall presentation of \"The Damnation of Faust.\" She graduated from the Spence School, a private institution in Manhattan, in 1996 and then earned a high school diploma when 15 years old by taking online extension courses offered by Stanford University (Education Program for Gifted Youth). She later enrolled at Columbia University and studied art history and French. In a change of venue, Emmy created the role of Abigail Williams in the daytime soap opera As the World Turns (1956) in 1997 and branched out in performances in the made-for-television movies Genius (1999) and The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), in which she played the title character as a young teenager. Other television work included Snoops (1999), Law & Order (1990), and The Practice (1997). Emmy made her theatrical feature debut in the indie film Songcatcher (2000), with her good friend Rhoda Griffis, which won the Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000. Rossum received an Independent Spirit Award nomination in the category of Best Debut Performance for her performance as an Appalachian orphan. She played an aspiring songwriter (the title character) in the romantic comedy Nola (2003). Cast as the ill-fated daughter of a small-business owner in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), she projected an aura of innocence that made her character's tragic death memorable and heartbreaking. This was her first major studio film. After six months of filming her role as the fresh-faced but highly intelligent teenage damsel in distress The Day After Tomorrow (2004) in Montreal, she returned to New York and screen-tested for the role of Christine in The Phantom of the Opera (2004) in full costume and makeup, and was finally selected for the part by Andrew Lloyd Webber after singing for him at his home. Although she was surprised to be chosen ahead of many better-known and older actresses considered for the part, the combination of her vulnerable, fragile beauty and fine, classically trained singing voice ultimately proved that she was perfectly cast. In preparation for the role, she took ballet classes for two months and started polishing her singing. Emmy has commented that, in her approach to acting, she draws heavily upon her own experiences, so she visited locations in Paris and conjured up what she terms \"past memories\" to draw upon in making her performance emotionally realistic. She stood on the roof of the Opéra Garnier, where Christine sings \"All I Ask of You,\" and went underneath the opera house, where there is actually a gloomy, dark lake. She studied Degas's paintings of ballerinas in the Musée d'Orsay to learn how to stand like one. Her next project Poseidon (2006) was a mainstream effort, but since its release, she has been more true to advice she obtained from Sean Penn when making Mystic River (2003), that she should be picky and only accept roles that are fun to do, such as Dragonball: Evolution (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwODE0NjU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAyMDYzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002536","name":"Emmy Rossum","nicknames":["Em","Emmy Grey"],"idIMDB":"nm0002536"},"actorId":"nm0002536","character":"Kimberly","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0404492","main":true},{"actorName":"Ben Scott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6954206","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ben Scott is an actor, known for Comet (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6954206","name":"Ben Scott","idIMDB":"nm6954206"},"actorId":"nm6954206","character":"Stunt driver","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lou Beatty Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0064187","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NjUyOTg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzAzMjA3OTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Lou Beatty Jr. is an actor, known for Finding Normal (2013), Cat City (2008) and NCIS (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NjUyOTg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzAzMjA3OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0064187","name":"Lou Beatty Jr.","idIMDB":"nm0064187"},"actorId":"nm0064187","character":"Conductor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ben Pace","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1383359","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMTE2MTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjA3NzM3MjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Ben Pace is known for his work on Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (2006), Comet (2014) and Elevator (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMTE2MTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjA3NzM3MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1383359","name":"Ben Pace","idIMDB":"nm1383359"},"actorId":"nm1383359","character":"Bartender","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicole Lucas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5879604","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Nicole Lucas is an actress, known for Comet (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5879604","name":"Nicole Lucas","idIMDB":"nm5879604"},"actorId":"nm5879604","character":"Waitress","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Connie Jackson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1635034","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYzMTA5N2ItY2NkZS00N2FjLTg0YWQtYzI5OTY0NDJhZTQyL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTEzOTQ3MA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Connie Jackson is an actress and producer, known for NCIS (2003), Forgiveness (2016) and My Name Is Lamar (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYzMTA5N2ItY2NkZS00N2FjLTg0YWQtYzI5OTY0NDJhZTQyL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTEzOTQ3MA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1635034","name":"Connie Jackson","idIMDB":"nm1635034"},"actorId":"nm1635034","character":"Nurse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2965412","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2965412","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":[{"money":"€7,603","country":"Portugal","day":"15","month":"02","year":"2015","remarks":"9 Screens"}],"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 31 min (91 min)"],"soundMix":["Dolby Digital"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":["Modern VideoFilm, Burbank (CA), USA (digital intermediate)"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["Digital (Digital Cinema Package DCP)"]},"rating":"6.8","metascore":"52","filmingLocations":[],"rated":"R","awards":[{"award":"Los Angeles Film Festival 2014","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Narrative Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Narrative Feature","names":[{"name":"Sam Esmail","id":"nm1322753","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Young Artist Awards 2015","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Young Artist Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Web Performance -
