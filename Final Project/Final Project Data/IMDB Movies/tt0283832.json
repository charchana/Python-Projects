She was only 14 when she auditioned for a secondary role in Le bal (1931): she got the part, and the producer offered her a five-year contract. She had her first romantic lead in La crise est finie (1934) and scored an international hit with the historical drama Mayerling (1936) in which she played Marie Vetsera opposite Charles Boyer. In 1938, she went to Hollywood to appear in the fine comedy The Rage of Paris (1938) but quickly returned to Paris. Darrieux remained in France during the Occupation and was one of the leading actresses during this period, starring in major hits such as Premier Rendez-Vous (1941). In 1945, she appeared both on stage (in \"Tristan et Isolde\") and on screen (in Au petit bonheur (1946)). In the next three decades, she found several important roles, in films like La Ronde (1950), The Earrings of Madame de... (1953) -- in which she gave her best performance, as a society lady torn between her husband and her lover -- and The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967). In 1970, she replaced Katharine Hepburn on Broadway in \"Coco.\" Afterwards, she made occasional screen and stage appearances. But she made a triumphant comeback in 2002, playing Catherine Deneuve's mother in the international hit 8 femmes (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNDMyMjAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk4MTM5Ng@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0201638","name":"Danielle Darrieux","idIMDB":"nm0201638"},"actorId":"nm0201638","character":"Mamy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017018","main":true},{"actorName":"Catherine Deneuve","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000366","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NDQ2MjYwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ0MDM2Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 October 1943","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Catherine Fabienne Dorléac","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Catherine Deneuve was born October 22, 1943 in Paris, France. Her parents were actors. She made her movie debut in 1957, when she was thirteen and continued with small parts in minor films, until Roger Vadim gave her a meatier role in Le vice et la vertu (1963). But her breakthrough came with the excellent musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), in which she gave an unforgettable performance as a romantic middle-class girl who falls in love with a young soldier but gets imprisoned in a loveless marriage with another man; the director was the gifted Jacques Demy, who also cast Deneuve in the less successful The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967). She then played a schizophrenic killer in Roman Polanski's Repulsion (1965) and a married woman who works as a part-time prostitute every afternoon in Luis Buñuel's masterpiece Belle de Jour (1967). She also worked with Buñuel in Tristana (1970) and gave a great performance for François Truffaut in Mississippi Mermaid (1969), a kind of apotheosis of her \"frigid femme fatale\" persona. In the seventies she didn't find parts of that caliber, but her magnificent work in Truffaut's Le dernier métro (1980) as a stage actress in Nazi-occupied Paris revived her career. She was also very good in the recent epic drama Indochine (1992), for which she earned her first Academy Award nomination (Best Actress). Although the elegant and always radiant Deneuve has never appeared on stage, she is universally hailed as one of the \"grandes dames\" of French cinema, joining a list that includes such illustrious talents as Simone Signoret, Jeanne Moreau, Isabelle Huppert, Isabelle Adjani and the younger Juliette Binoche.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NDQ2MjYwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ0MDM2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000366","name":"Catherine Deneuve","idIMDB":"nm0000366"},"actorId":"nm0000366","character":"Gaby","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017013","main":true},{"actorName":"Isabelle Huppert","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001376","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgzMzI3NTEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMxNjM4Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 March 1953","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Isabelle Ann Huppert","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Isabelle Huppert was born in 1953, in Paris, France, but spent her childhood in Ville d'Avray. Encouraged by her mother (who was a teacher of English), she followed the Conservatory of Versailles and won an acting prize for her work in Alfred de Musset's \"Un caprice\". She then studied at the Conservatoire d'Art Dramatique and followed an illustrious theatrical career, which includes Ivan Turgenev's \"A Month in the Country\", Euripides' \"Medea\" (title role) etc. She made her movie debut in 1971 and soon became one of the top actresses of her generation, giving fine performances in important films, like Claude Goretta's The Lacemaker (1977), as a simple-minded girl who falls in love with - and is betrayed by - a student, Jean-Luc Godard's Every Man for Himself (1980), as a prostitute, and Maurice Pialat's Loulou (1980), as an upper-class woman who is physically attracted by a young vagabond. She made her US debut playing a brothel madam in Michael Cimino's disastrous Heaven's Gate (1980) and has an extremely productive collaboration with Claude Chabrol, who cast her in several movies, including Violette (1978), in which she played a young woman who murders her parents, and Story of Women (1988), in which she gave an excellent performance as a shameless abortionist, the last woman to be executed in France.

She lived with her mother, brothers, and sister on a farm not far from Saint-Tropez in Provence (southern France), because her father, singer and poet Guy Béart, did not want his children to be affected by the glamour world of Paris. When Emmanuelle was thirteen, she saw Romy Schneider in the movie Mado (1976). From that time on, she wanted to be an actress. In Emmanuelle's teens, her parents sent her to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for four years, so she could learn English. There, she was engaged for a Robert Altman movie that was never made. After returning to France, she took drama classes and got her first TV role, in Raison perdue (1984). David Hamilton, the photographer/director, was impressed by her beauty and gave her a role in Premiers désirs (1983). She met her spouse-to-be, Daniel Auteuil, while making L'amour en douce (1985). The film that made her famous in France was Manon of the Spring (1986), in which she played the role of a blonde shepherd dancing nude in the fields. Director Tom McLoughlin chose her out of 5,000 candidates for her first Hollywood picture, Date with an Angel (1987). Emmanuelle is a very sensitive and a perfectionist. For the part of Camille in the film Un Coeur en Hiver (1992), she took violin lessons for a whole year. Her biggest success was as a nude model in the art film La belle noiseuse (1991), which starred Michel Piccoli and was directed by Jacques Rivette.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNDQ4ODU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjI0ODgz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000322","name":"Emmanuelle Béart","idIMDB":"nm0000322"},"actorId":"nm0000322","character":"Louise","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0045480","main":true},{"actorName":"Fanny Ardant","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000272","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NzI4MTMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwMTAxMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 March 1949","placeOfBirth":" Saumur, Maine-et-Loire, France","birthName":"Fanny Marguerite Judith Ardant","height":"5' 8½\" (1.74 m)","bio":"Fanny Ardent was the youngest of 5 children born to a cavalry officer and his wife. She was raised in Monte Carlo where she was educated at a convent school. A voracious reader, she discovered Proust at age 15 and felt as though his writings were for her. When she was 17 her father died and the shock of his loss never left her. Shortly before his death Ardant started acting on stage. However following her father's death she followed his advice and went to university in Aix-en-Provence where she read Political Science. Upon graduation she took a job working for the French embassy in London from which she was sacked for poor time keeping and being dishevelled. The latter was attributed to the social whirl she enjoyed in London. Ardant continued working odd jobs in London before deciding, almost on a whim, to go to drama school. She returned to France for her studies and before long began acting on stage and then on television. At the age of 31 she was contacted by Francois Truffaut who had spotted her in a television drama and wanted to cast her in his film The Woman Next Door (1981). While working together Ardant and Truffaut fell in love and in 1983 she gave birth to their daughter Josephine. Truffaut died a year later from a brain tumour.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NzI4MTMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwMTAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000272","name":"Fanny Ardant","idIMDB":"nm0000272"},"actorId":"nm0000272","character":"Pierrette","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017017","main":true},{"actorName":"Virginie Ledoyen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001461","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzA4NTY0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDM5MzU0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 November 1976","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Virginie Fernandez","height":"5' 5¼\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Virginie Ledoyen was born Virginie Fernandez on 15 November 1976 in Aubervilliers, near Paris.

Ludivine studied acting as a young girl and had made her movie debut at the age 10 in Les maris, les femmes, les amants (1989). She has established her reputation as one of the brightest young stars in French and international cinema in her collaborations with French filmmaker François Ozon, starting with Gouttes d'eau sur pierres brûlantes (2000) (based on a screenplay by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 8 femmes (2002) and in Swimming Pool (2003). For her performance in 8 femmes (2002), she won a Cesar Award nomination (the French equivalent of the Oscar) and the Romy Schneider Award that is given each year to a promising young French actress. In that film, Sagnier proved her acting prowess by distinguishing herself in a stellar cast that included the legendary actresses Danielle Darrieux, Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Huppert as well as Emmanuelle Béart and Fanny Ardant. Along with these grand ladies of the French cinema, Sagnier won the Best Actress Award from the European Film Academy Award and the Silver Bear Award at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival. Swimming Pool (2003) represented her crossover into English-language cinema. (Sagnier played her first English language role in Rage de dent (2006).) Marketed in the U.S. with a comely shot of Sagnier sunbathing alongside a pool, Ozon's film became one of the biggest-grossing foreign movies in the U.S. during 2003. So far, she has turned down large monetary offers to appear in American films as the foreign girlfriend of young American superstars, as she remains committed to French cinema. Sagnier became a mother on March 25, 2005, when she gave birth to a daughter named Bonnie by her boyfriend, French actor Nicolas Duvauchelle.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjkyNzU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4OTkzOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756203","name":"Ludivine Sagnier","idIMDB":"nm0756203"},"actorId":"nm0756203","character":"Catherine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0017016","main":true},{"actorName":"Firmine Richard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723796","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZhOTYwYjctZjNkNi00OTMxLWE3MjktMWQwNDU4ZGQxMDZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc4MzI2NQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 September 1947","placeOfBirth":" Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, France","bio":"Firmine Richard was born on September 25, 1947 in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, France.
