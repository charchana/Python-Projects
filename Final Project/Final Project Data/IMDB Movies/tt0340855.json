She was raised on a farm outside the city. Theron is of Afrikaner (Dutch, with some French Huguenot and German) descent, and Afrikaner military figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle. Theron received an education as a ballet dancer and has danced both the \"Swan Lake\" and \"The Nutcracker\". There was not much for a young actress or dancer to do in South Africa, so she soon traveled to Europe and the United States, where she got job at the Joffrey Ballet in New York. She was also able to work as a photo model. However, an injured knee put a halt to her dancing career. In 1994, her mother bought her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, and Charlize started visiting all of the agents on Hollywood Boulevard, but without any luck. She went to a bank to cash a check for $500 she received from her mother, and became furious when she learned that the bank would not cash it because it was an out-of-state check. She made a scene and an agent gave her his card, in exchange for learning American English, which she did by watching soap operas on television. Her first role was as a young mother in a park in a B-film in 1995, but it was a non-speaking role with three seconds of screen time. Her next role was as Helga Svelgen in 2 Days in the Valley (1996), which landed her the role of Tina Powers in That Thing You Do! (1996). Since then, she has starred in movies like The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999), The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) and The Italian Job (2003). On February 29, 2004, she won her first Academy Award, for her performance in Monster (2003).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5Mzc4ODU0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU1NTI0Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234","name":"Charlize Theron","nicknames":["Charlie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000234"},"actorId":"nm0000234","character":"Aileen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010770","main":true},{"actorName":"Christina Ricci","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000207","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUzMzk5NzcyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ1NjkzNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 February 1980","placeOfBirth":" Santa Monica, California, USA","height":"5' 0¼\" (1.53 m)","bio":"Precocious, outspoken child-teen starlet of the 1990s, Christina Ricci was born in 1980 in Santa Monica, California, the youngest of four children of Sarah (Murdoch), a realtor, and Ralph Ricci, a lawyer and therapist.

His paternal grandfather, George Henry Dern, served as Governor of Utah (1925-1933) and then U.S. Secretary of War (1933-1936). His ancestry includes German, English, Scottish, and Dutch. Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies' premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Coming Home (1978). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on. Jack Nicholson, a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under Franklin D. Roosevelt. When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of The Great Gatsby (1974), he acquitted himself quite well. Some critics said that \"Gatsby\" would have been better if Dern rather than Robert Redford had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson's brother in The King of Marvin Gardens (1972) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in \"Coming Home,\" a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous \"Oscar curse\" that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner Gig Young, Dern's co-star in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969). Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even Anthony Perkins in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before \"Coming Home.\" He failed, and his career suffered. Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with Waterhole #3 (1967). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, Middle Age Crazy (1980), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in Tattoo (1981). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star Maud Adams, a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern's star was seriously dimmed. Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning play That Championship Season (1982), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie Toughlove (1985), but overall, his career was floundering. Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in After Dark, My Sweet (1990), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, Diane Ladd, and their daughter, Laura Dern, kicked into high gear. Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema's premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down John Wayne in The Cowboys (1972), Dern's career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor's artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMDE0MzAzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODQxMDQ1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001136","name":"Bruce Dern","idIMDB":"nm0001136"},"actorId":"nm0001136","character":"Thomas","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010771","main":true},{"actorName":"Lee Tergesen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855564","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NjQ3Nzc2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIwOTQwMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 July 1965","placeOfBirth":" Ivoryton, Connecticut, USA","birthName":"Lee Allen Tergesen","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"He was born on July 8, 1965 in Ivoryton, Connecticut and is a graduate of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

In both these films he played something of a blathering redneck idiot, although there was a streak of pathos in both performances which made it impossible to dismiss his characters as just 'bad' people. In 'David Lynch''s Wild at Heart (1990) and Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder (1990), he put in performances which showed he was merely biding his time before his next great role came along. Well, as luck would have it, two great roles came along in two years. As Rub Squeers, Paul Newman's emotional work partner in Nobody's Fool (1994), he put in an excellent performance. However, this performance was nothing compared to the acting powerhouse which was Heavy (1995). In this tender indie film, also marking Liv Tyler's first proper film role, Vince practically carries the whole film, and does so with style. Watching him gradually lose grip of his life breaks your heart, and it is without doubt one of the most underrated performances of the 90s. Vince has not really had a film role to touch this since, but he has been in the cult hit crime show, Murder One: Diary of a Serial Killer (1997), as Clifford Banks. It was a rare opportunity for Vince to flex his acting muscles as a slightly different type of character. Vince undoubtedly has the ability to be a major star; he just needs to be given the opportunity.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2NjAwNDE4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMzODQwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0898546","name":"Pruitt Taylor Vince","idIMDB":"nm0898546"},"actorId":"nm0898546","character":"Gene / Stuttering \"John\"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marco St. John","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0820660","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3Njk3NjAwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM4MjY2NDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 May 1939","placeOfBirth":" New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","birthName":"Mark S.

The Georgia-born native (Atlanta born and raised) was awarded a basketball scholarship following high school at Georgia's Southern Tech University to study architecture. Instead, Wilson hitchhiked to Los Angeles on a whim and hooked up one day with an actor he met in a bar who took him to one of his auditions. Allowed to audition himself by chance, Wilson lost the part but was absolutely hooked. Working an assortment of menial jobs, he studied for nearly five years while gaining experience in such local theater productions as \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" Scott's fledgling career took off big time after being discovered by director Norman Jewison who cast him as a murder suspect in In the Heat of the Night (1967) starring Sidney Poitier and \"Best Actor\" Oscar winner Rod Steiger. If that weren't a sufficient beginning, Wilson immediately followed this with the co-lead role of murderer Richard Hickok in the stark and disturbing In Cold Blood (1967), a superlative adaptation of Truman Capote best-selling docu-novel. It didn't hurt that Scott himself had a startling resemblance to the real-life killer. Partnering up with Robert Blake as two ex-cons who are eventually executed for the senseless, brutal slaughter of an entire Kansas farm family, the critically acclaimed film put both men squarely on the movie map. Although a serious contender, out-and-out stardom did not come about for the quietly handsome, slightly forlorn-looking actor. Major roles in major pictures, however, did. Among Scott's early film work were Castle Keep (1969) and The Gypsy Moths (1969), both starring Burt Lancaster; The Grissom Gang (1971); Lolly-Madonna XXX (1973) (again with Steiger); The New Centurions (1972); The Great Gatsby (1974), in which he earned raves as the garage owner who shoots Robert Redford's title character to death in Gatsby's backyard swimming pool; The Ninth Configuration (1980), for which he received a Golden Globe nomination; The Right Stuff (1983); the Venice Film Festival winner L'année du soleil calme (1984) [A Year of the Quiet Sun]; Malone (1987) and Johnny Handsome (1989). TV also showed off Scott's dark, controlled intensity and wide range in later years, appearing in guest spots on such popular dramas as \"The X-Files\" and \"The Twilight Zone,\" and in a recurring role as Marg Helgenberger's unscrupulous mobster father in \"CSI.\" In minimovies Scott played everything from Elvis's father in Elvis and the Colonel: The Untold Story (1993) to a Wyoming governor in The Jack Bull (1999). Hardly one of Hollywood's flashiest good ol' boys, the taciturn, unassuming actor has preferred to remain discrete and let his performances do the talking. His output has been minimal compared with other character stars, but he has remained in the quality ranks nevertheless, mixing his standard penchant for darker movies with such family-oriented films as Shiloh (1996) and its 2006 sequel. Supporting the newer \"young guns\" these days, he appeared with Vince Vaughn in Clay Pigeons (1998) and Ryan Phillippe in The Way of the Gun (2000), and ended up one of serial killer Charlize Theron's victims in Monster (2003). Other strong showings on the big screen have included a lead part as a rockabilly star in Don't Let Go (2002) and his down-home patriarch in the superb ensemble art film Junebug (2005), a breakout hit with Academy voters. More recently, Scott has gained a following sporting a full grey beard and ponytailed as grizzled farm owner Hershel Greene in the cable series The Walking Dead: Webisodes (2011). Wilson resides in Los Angeles along with his wife of nearly four decades, Heavenly, an attorney and accomplished artist and writer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMjA2MDA4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM4MzMzNDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0934113","name":"Scott Wilson","idIMDB":"nm0934113"},"actorId":"nm0934113","character":"Horton / Last \"John\"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rus Blackwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085952","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDY2NjgwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzExODM3Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 March 1963","placeOfBirth":" Rockford, Illinois, USA","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Rus Blackwell started his acting career in New York, training at Circle in the Square Theatre School and working on stage.

His parents, Barney and Martha Ware provided much love and support throughout his childhood and have continued to have a huge impact on his life. His parents and extended family offered many unique and wonderful opportunities to him, and he took advantage of as many as possible. At the age of 13 he learned to fly and by the age of 15 was working as a crop duster on weekends and summers. Before he had his pilot's license Tim and his cousin were able to start Mid-Georgia Crop Dusters with financial help from a family member. The company was in business for the next 30 years. He attended Marist School in Atlanta and went to Duke University on a tennis scholarship. At Duke Tim had double majors, drama and finance. Upon graduation he did a stint in the Marines. He then worked for his great uncle on his various business interests throughout Europe, Asia and Africa. Tim found the work was both fulfilling and exhausting. After four years Tim moved on. He became a firefighter for the City of Decatur Georgia and continued his crop dusting. Twice a month he would fly to New York where he studied under acting coach Uta Hagen. Several years later, with Uta's encouragement he began doing stage work. During a performance of God's Favorite he was seen by an agent and signed on the spot. He landed a role on his first audition, joined SAG, and has been acting ever since. Tim married his wife, Dee, in 1995 and shortly after they began working together in the wireless communication business.

He attended a number of schools until finally, he was sent to Marist Military Academy in Atlanta, after which he had a short spell in the Army. One day Brett went with a friend to the theater building to wait as he auditioned for a show. While he waited the director asked him if he wanted to audition. He landed a role and from that moment on lived, ate and drank the theater. For the next five years he went to every theater in Atlanta and auditioned for almost everything that came along. This included a TV pilot for The Catlins (1982) which led to a two year contract. He got a part in The Bear (1984), with Gary Busey and then a role in a TV movie called Poison Ivy (1985), with 'Michael J. Fox', 'Adam Baldwin' and Nancy McKeon. Work dried up until Brett started a fantastic run of luck in which he worked solidly thru the 90s. He played in due TV shows such as I'll Fly Away (1991), In the Heat of the Night (1988), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), and many more. Theatrical Films included Forrest Gump (1994), Edward Scissorhands (1990), Kalifornia (1993), Passenger 57 (1992), From the Earth to the Moon (1998), The Waterboy (1998) and most recently as a co-star in Remember the Titans (2000) in which he played Coach Tyrell opposite Denzel Washington and 'Will Patton'. Brett has a guest appearance on the television show, Sheena (2000). The episode, 'Stranded in the Jungle' will be shown in 2002. Brett has over 75 credits for TV and Film, and at least that many credits for the stage. He has become a Councilor at Large with SAG to get more closely involved with the unusual politics and negotiations with producers in LA and NY.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY5NDU2MjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQyNTQwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723365","name":"Brett Rice","idIMDB":"nm0723365"},"actorId":"nm0723365","character":"Charles","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kaitlin Riley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1156227","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"Kaitlin Ann Riley","bio":"Kaitlin Riley was born as Kaitlin Ann Riley.
