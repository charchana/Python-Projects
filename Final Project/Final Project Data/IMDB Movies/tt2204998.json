Generation Red Nation gives a brutally honest view of life on Indian reservations, leaving the Reservation, and city life. With 89 percent unemployment, rampant substance abuse, the shortest lifespans in the nation, climbing teen suicide rates, and substandard education, how can they create a better life for their children? Part of the solution embraces American Indian culture, family values, and traditions taught by Elders. Our Nation can benefit from their advice, especially when many of us feel victimized by corruption from corporate and government leaders.","simplePlot":"Reckless government policies nearly destroyed American Indians and could do the same to the U.S. Just as with American Indians, they stole from us with recent bailouts, allowed our ...

He was the first national director of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in which role he became prominent during the 1973 standoff with the U.S. government at Wounded Knee. In 1987, he joined the U.S. Libertarian Party and announced his candidacy for the party's presidential nomination. (He lost the nomination to Congressman Ron Paul). Since 1992, Means has appeared in The Last of the Mohicans (1992), Natural Born Killers (1994) and other movies. He has championed the rights of indigenous peoples in other countries as well as the U.S. In a televised speech to the 2000 Libertarian Party National Convention, Means said that he prefers the label \"Indian\" to the more politically-correct \"Native American\". \"Everyone who is born in America is a native American\", he said.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwOTQzNTMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzUyNDA0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0575184","name":"Russell Means","idIMDB":"nm0575184"},"actorId":"nm0575184","character":"Russell Means","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2204998","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204998","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["54 min"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.3","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"6","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[]}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 05:20:49"}}
