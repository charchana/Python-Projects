It was hailed as the second best story ever written - behind only \"The Bible.\" But his mother was stoned out of her mind that day, so Richard went to get a second opinion. Unfortunately, he didn't know anyone else. So he sent it to Hollywood. And they sent it back. He decided to start entering his masterpiece into every contest around. Four thousand and three hundred dollars later, nothing happened. And then finally, when all looked lost, he broke through and became a Quarter Finalist in the El Paso, Texas Eighth Annual Screenplay Contest for Minority Writers with Stoned Mothers. This was a glimmer of hope. Someone saw potential. And out of the 13 total entrants, Richard beat two of them. This opened the floodgates of confidence. Richard then went on to write 15 more screenplays. They all sucked. And then he really hit the big time. Richard became a finalist in the Academy Foundation's Nicholl's Fellowship - the most prestigious screenwriting contest in the universe with the screenplays \"Little Park Little\" and \"Cult of Portman, Natalie.\" In 2010, Richard was named a finalist in the Austin Film Festival screenplay competition with his dramedy The Undercard (2014). It has since been optioned by producer Dawn Wiercinski and attached to producer Richard Bever of Chill Films and director Mark Robert Ellis. In 2012, Richard co-wrote the family screenplay My Dog the Champion (2013) with Robin Nations, which has been released by Anchor Bay and stars Lance Henriksen, Dora Madison Burge, and Cody Linley. Richard then wrote The Adventures of Pepper and Paula (2014), a family film inspired by actual events in the life of world champion female gunslinger Pistol Packin' Paula. This was released in 2015 and stars Mindy Raymond, Holt Boggs, Jon Michael Davis, and Alexandria Deberry. Both films were produced and directed by Kevin Nations and Robin Nations. Also in 2015, three features were produced and co-written by Richard. First was the remake of the eighties cult classic \"Soul Man\" called My B.F.F. and stars C. Thomas Howell, Lew Temple, and Meta Golding, produced and directed by Nestor Carter. Second was a teen apocalyptic drama called Stage V with writer/director Buddy Calvo and produced by San Antonio Spur Boris Diaw. Lastly is the light family comedy The Conway Curve, directed by Marian Yeager and starring Veronica Wylie and Casper Van Dien. New for 2017 is the family spoof Avengers of Justice: The Farce Awakens, produced by Automatic Entertainment, starring Amy Smart, Stephen Rannazzisi, Simon Rex, Tony Cavalero, and directed by Jarret Tarnol. Also in development are the dance flick Steppin' produced and directed by Greg Carter, and El Cucuy - a feature horror produced by Marc Martinez and Sean Roldan.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1ODMyODM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUzMzczOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3134495","name":"Richard Dane Scott","idIMDB":"nm3134495"},"actorId":"nm3134495","character":"Captain Crow's Feet","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jamye Cox","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4930035","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jamye Cox was born in Beeville, Texas.
