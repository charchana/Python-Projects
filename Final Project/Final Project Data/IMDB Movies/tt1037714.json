He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips. In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. \"I didn't like total submission to a leader other than myself,\" he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim (Robert Beck). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash. As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group Public Enemy, it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal \"Cop Killer,\" was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, Charlton Heston, to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros. The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), which is ironic for someone famous for \"Cop Killer\" and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, Coco Austin.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3ODYyMDQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM3MTAzNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001384","name":"Ice-T","nicknames":["Ice"],"idIMDB":"nm0001384"},"actorId":"nm0001384","character":"Himself - Roaster","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jimmy Kimmel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0453994","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMjU5MjgzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYxODk3OQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 November 1967","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"James Christian Kimmel","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Jimmy Kimmel was born on November 13, 1967 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA as James Christian Kimmel.

Her accomplishments have gone far beyond the wrestling ring and far beyond anyone's expectations. Before exchanging body slams, modeling for top magazines and guest-starring on hundreds of shows, Chyna was a shy girl who was born in Rochester, New York. She spent most of her childhood in a home filled with alcoholism and domestic problems. She found her escape through working out, and began doing aerobics and lifting weights at a gym near her home. This is where she found her true niche: in the world of fitness. As the only female in the gym, Chyna always stood out but developed bonds and friendships with the gym members that gave her the encouragement to keep going in the world of fitness. She broke all gender barriers everywhere she went and continued her love of fitness throughout her college days. Chyna graduated from the University of Tampa with a 3.9 GPA and a double major in Spanish Literature in under two years. She also studied foreign languages and can speak English, Spanish, German and French. Chyna is a true humanitarian and has served in the US Army ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps) and the Peace Corps, helping to teach illiterate third-world children to read. She is a strong supporter of the National Animal Rescue charity, which helps domesticated animals find good, loving homes. Throughout her life Chyna always dreamed of being an entertainer. She began that career in the early 1990s as a belly dancer and soon moved on to fitness competitions, but at 6'0\" the star found her real calling in the entertainment world: professional wrestling. She began training to be a professional wrestler under the guidance of the wrestling legend Walter 'Killer' Kowalski, in a professional wrestling school in which all the other students were men. She soon took the world of women's wrestling by storm and began competing in the PGWA, where she was named the 1996 Rookie of the Year award for the Women's Championship. After dominating the world of women's wrestling Chyna was discovered by Paul Levesque (aka \"Triple H\") and Shawn Michaels (HBK), two WWF (World Wrestling Federation) superstars who helped Chyna break into the big time. She made her worldwide television debut in February 1997 as a bodyguard for Triple H but soon went on to break all gender stereotypes by competing with some of the toughest men in the WWF, under the name \"Chyna\". Years later she became the only woman to qualify for the Royal Rumble and King of the Ring tournaments and became the only female Intercontinental Champion and the only undefeated Women's Champion in WWF history. Five years after she debuted as a professional wrestler in the WWF, Chyna parted ways with the company. She then toured Japan, taking the country by storm and battling in the ring with the likes of such champions as Keiji Mutô, The Great Kabuki, and most notably, Masahiro Chôno. Her 2002 Tokyo Dome match against Chono earned her the title of Nikkian Sport's 2002 Women's Wrestler of the Year. Meanwhile, back in the US, Chyna appeared in several films, hosted a variety of shows and showed that women can combine strength and beauty in two top-selling issues of \"Playboy\" magazine, which proved to the world that women can be beautiful without having the anorexic \"Twiggy\" look. She also appeared in the first-ever Playboy documentary, which did in-depth interviews with Chyna, her former manager Rich Minzer, her friend Joe Gold and Hugh M. Hefner himself. Her strong will to the best and \"survival of the fittest\" attitude made her one of the top wrestlers in history. She has served as a role model to millions of men and women by proving anything is possible through hard work and determination. In her best-selling autobiography \"If They Only Knew\" she discussed what it took to make it to the top and showed the world what she had to overcome to make her one of the most well-known pop culture icons in the world. Shortly after her first appearance in \"Playboy\" she released her own fitness video, Chyna Fitness: More Than Meets the Eye (2000), which won awards from fitness and lifestyle magazines. The video is still popular with both Chyna's fans and fitness fans alike. Unlike most former pro wrestlers, Chyna has had success on her own two feet. She has been on nearly every talk show and has been featured on hundreds of magazine covers from \"Playboy\" and \"Newsweek\" to \"TV Guide\" and \"People\". She has been featured on Reggie Benjamin's CD \"2X-Centrix\", performing drums and back up vocals. She was on the top of the \"dance music\" billboard charts for five weeks with the CD single \"Ride\". She also sang with her own rock band, \"The Chynna Dolls\", for a short time, playing venues like The Roxy, Elrey Theater, Hollywood Athletic Center and two performances on Howard Stern (1994). She has starred in two comedies, Cougar Club (2007) and Illegal Aliens (2007). She has also hosted a variety of shows, from Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors (2001) to FYE and AMC's \"Tough Guys series. She had many guest-starring roles on TV series, such as Whose Line Is It Anyway? (1998), 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996), Pacific Blue (1996), The Nick Cannon Show (2002), Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996), MADtv (1995), MTV's \"Diary\" and many others.

In 2008 she was featured on VH1's Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew (2008) TV series to conquer personal demons and depression caused from an abusive relationship and childhood trauma. In 2009, she released a fashion book, \"Paper Doll\", which became a best-seller. In May 2011 she returned to the world of wrestling with TNA, debuting on the May 12 edition of TNA Impact! Wrestling (2004), and followed it up with one last match at the TNA Sacrifice (2011) Pay Per View, where she and Kurt Angle took on Jeff Jarrett and Karen Angle. That episode was one of the highest-rated for the company in many years. Although her match with TNA was a one-time-only deal, Chyna showed the world she had turned her life around--she overcame depression, emotional trauma and was finally where she wanted to be in life. In June 2011, Chyna released her first adult video with Vivid Entertainment called, Backdoor to Chyna (2011), which sold over a million copies. She said the movie allowed her to regain control of her life, gave her a newfound confidence and got her back on her feet. She embarked on a huge media tour, appearing all over the US. She began feature dancing at high-end nightclubs, appeared on dozens of radio shows including Howard Stern on Demand (2005) and ABC radio and in November 2011 won a Fleshbot Award for her \"Backdoor to Chyna\" video. In 2012, she appeared in A Night at the Silent Movie Theater (2012) and appeared in the music video \"Gonna Make You Love Me\" for the band Lovechild. She also appeared in a tell-all interview with KayFabe Commentaries in which she discussed everything from her childhood to drugs, porn and everything in between. Chyna's future looks bright these days; with her past behind her she is ready for her next project.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4ODE5ODU4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDEwNzU1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491321","name":"Chyna","nicknames":["Va-Chyna","The Ninth Wonder of the World","Mamacita"],"idIMDB":"nm0491321"},"actorId":"nm0491321","character":"Herself - Audience Member","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ron Jeremy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000465","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzExNDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDc4MDM1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 March 1953","placeOfBirth":" Long Island, New York, USA","birthName":"Ronald Jeremy Hyatt","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Since the demise of the legendary John Holmes in March 1988, the short, mustachioed, heavyset Ron Jeremy has assumed the mantle as the number one U.S. male star of adult cinema. However, don't confuse Ron with the similar looking mustachioed 1970/'80s adult film star, Harry Reems, who has long since retired from the adult film industry. Portly Ron is not blessed with film star looks and a chiseled six-pack (a decidedly unchiseled 12- or 18-pack would be more like it) - his appeal and talents lie in other areas (which happen to be in his long 'member' measuring nearly 10 inches, erect!) and his \"regular guy\" appearance and amazing endurance in front of the camera have undoubtedly contributed to his phenomenal success in an industry notorious for dumping those men who can't perform on cue. He's also one of the very few adult film stars to make the jump into mainstream cinema, with minor appearances in movies such as Reindeer Games (2000), Detroit Rock City (1999) and The Boondock Saints (1999). He was born Ron Jeremy Hyatt on March 12, 1953, in New York City and graduated from Cardozo High School (Queens, NY) in 1971, attained a masters degree from Queens College and then commenced special educational teaching in the New York City area. In 1978, a girlfriend sent his photo off to \"Playgirl\" magazine for appearance in its \"Boy Next Door\" pages. It was an understatement to say that Ron was deluged with female fan mail, and letters of interest from adult filmmakers! Beginning in 1979, he has appeared in well over 800 adult feature films including Inside Seka (1981), Debbie Does Dallas Part II (1981), Terms of Endowment (1986) Lust of Blackula (1987), 21 Hump Street (1988) and Natural Born Thrillers (1994). At 50+ years of age, the charismatic and often comedic Ron Jeremy is still appearing in front of the camera in adult films and he's definitely attained iconic status in the adult entertainment industry and beyond.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzExNDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDc4MDM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000465","name":"Ron Jeremy","nicknames":["Hedgehog","The Porn King","R.J."],"idIMDB":"nm0000465"},"actorId":"nm0000465","character":"Himself - Audience Member","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt1037714","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037714","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":"22","month":"07","year":"2007","remarks":null},null],"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 30 min (90 min) (USA)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Warner Brothers Studios - 5800 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA"}],"awards":[],"votes":"1,436","type":"TV Special","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0029768","name":"Comedy Central"},{"idCompany":"co0000948","name":"Tenth Planet Productions"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["tv special","rapper","stand up comedy","rap","hip hop","character name in title"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 07:34:35"}}
