He grew up humbly in the Fulton Housing Projects. He began zeroing in on his comedic skills while still a child, conjuring up a number of weird characters that were later utilized on his older brother Keenen Ivory Wayans' ground-breaking In Living Color (1990), the show that made Damon a huge comedy star. Ostracized by other children due to a severe physical disability - a club foot - humor was a strong part of helping Damon overcome a severely painful and debilitating childhood. He wore leg braces, orthopedic shoes and endured numerous surgeries before his affliction was corrected. Dropping out of high school in the ninth grade, he worked various jobs (mail clerk, etc.) until following older brother Keenen out to Hollywood to seek comedy fame and fortune. Doing the typical L.A. stand-up scene starting in 1982, he toured in national comedy club circuits until earning a regular featured slot on Saturday Night Live (1975) for one season (1985-1986). On the big screen he had a number of bit parts in films that showcased Hollywood's top comedians, including Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop (1984), his movie debut, and Steve Martin in Roxanne (1987). He also appeared briefly in brother Keenen's film spoofs Hollywood Shuffle (1987) and I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (1988). Damon gained major notice as an alien alongside Jeff Goldblum and future co-star Jim Carrey in the wild and woolly Earth Girls Are Easy (1988), as well as in various supporting roles that included Punchline (1988) with Tom Hanks and the grim cop drama Colors (1988) with Sean Penn. Smart-alec superstardom, however, came to him via the TV (thanks again to older brother Keenen) in the form of the landmark sketch variety series \"In Living Color\". The show, created and hosted by Keenen, gave Damon a showcase in which he easily broke out among the talented ensemble players with his eclectic gallery of sketch characters that usually bordered on raunch: Homey the Clown, the disabled Handiman and the outrageously gay film critic Blaine Edwards from the \"Men on Film\" skits. In 1992 Damon followed brother Keenan off the popular show over creative and financial issues. For the last decade and a half the slyly sarcastic comic has become his own \"Man on Film.\" He was Bruce Willis' partner in the noticeably violent crime thriller The Last Boy Scout (1991); wrote, executive-produced and starred as a former con man trying to mend his ways in Mo' Money (1992), which also featured younger brother Marlon Wayans; expanded his \"In Living Color\" handicapped superhero character Handiman into feature-length form with Blankman (1994); played an in-your-face drill sergeant in the aptly titled Major Payne (1995); co-starred with Adam Sandler as a cop bringing in a petty crook (Adam Sandler) in the action comedy Bulletproof (1996); joined in the basketball-themed Celtic Pride (1996); and stretched his acting muscles in Spike Lee's comedy-drama Bamboozled (2000). He was also executive producer on Waynehead (1996), a Saturday morning animated show based on his childhood that featured the voices of younger sibs Kim Wayans, Marlon and Shawn Wayans. Although his strongest suit is still in stand-up (he has starred in several HBO comedy specials), Damon went back to steady TV employment as star and executive producer of the sitcom My Wife and Kids (2001). Divorced from his wife Lisa, he is the father of four, including actor Damon Wayans Jr..","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTQ2OTU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTMxNTM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001834","name":"Damon Wayans","idIMDB":"nm0001834"},"actorId":"nm0001834","character":"Maj.

He was born as Frederick Reginald Ironside on February 12, 1950 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ironside was a successful arm wrestler in his teenage years. His initial ambition was to be a writer. At age fifteen, Michael wrote a play called \"The Shelter\" that won first prize in a Canada-wide university contest; He used the prize money to mount a production of this play. Ironside attended the Ontario College of Art, took acting lessons from Janine Manatis, and studied for three years at the Canadian National Film Board. Ironside worked in construction as a roofer prior to embarking on an acting career. Ironside first began acting in movies in the late 1970s. He received plenty of recognition with his frightening turn as deadly and powerful psychic Darryl Revok in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981). He was likewise very chilling as vicious misogynistic psychopath Colt Hawker in the underrated Terreur à l'hôpital central (1982). Other memorable film roles include weary Detective Roersch in the sadly forgotten thriller Cross Country (1983), the crazed Overdog in the immensely enjoyable Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983), the hard-nosed Jester in the blockbuster smash Top Gun (1986), ramrod Major Paul Hackett in Extreme Prejudice (1987), loner Vietnam veteran \"Ben\" in Nowhere to Hide (1987), the ferocious Lem Johnson in Watchers (1988), and lethal immortal General Katana in Highlander II: The Quickening (1991). Moreover, Ironside has appeared in two highly entertaining science fiction features for Paul Verhoeven: At his savage best as the evil Richter in Total Recall (1990) and typically excellent as the rugged Lieutenant Jean Rasczak in Starship Troopers (1997). Ironside showed a more tender and thoughtful side with his lovely and touching performance as a hardened convict who befriends a disabled man in the poignant indie drama gem Chaindance (1991); he also co-wrote the script and served as an executive producer for this beautiful sleeper. Michael was terrific as tough mercenary Ham Tyler on the epic miniseries V (1984), its follow up V: The Final Battle (1984), and subsequent short-lived spin-off series. Ironside also had a recurring role on the television series SeaQuest 2032 (1993). Among the television series he has done guest spots on are The A-Team (1983), Hill Street Blues (1981), The New Mike Hammer (1984), Deadly Nightmares (1983), Tales from the Crypt (1989), Superman (1996), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), Au-delà du réel - l'aventure continue (1995), ER (1994), Smallville (2001), ER (1994), Desperate Housewives (2004), Justice League (2001) and Masters of Horror (2005). More recently, Ironside garnered a slew of plaudits and a Gemini Award nomination for his outstanding portrayal of shrewd biker gang leader Bob Durelle in the acclaimed Canadian miniseries The Last Chapter II: The War Continues (2003). In addition to his substantial film and television work, Ironside has also lent his distinctive deep voice to TV commercials and video games.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NTg3MDYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0ODc3ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000461","name":"Michael Ironside","idIMDB":"nm0000461"},"actorId":"nm0000461","character":"Lt.
