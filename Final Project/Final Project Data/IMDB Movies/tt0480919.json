At the age of 15 her family moved to Italy where she graduated in Foreign Languages and Literatures from \"La Sapienza\" University in Rome. Her passion for acting and drama led her to study at \"Conservatory of Theatre\" (formerly \"La Scaletta\") under direction of G.B.Diotajuti, who shaped her passion for acting into professional skill. Her initial step toward the dream of the big screen came with her supporting role in the film by Tinto Brass Monamour (2006). Then came a series of small parts in films like: _'Animanera' (2008) by Raffaele Verzillo, 'Nelle tue mani' (2007 by Peter Del Monte as well as 'Il papà di Giovanna' (2008) and 'Gli amici del bar Margherita' (2009) by Pupi Avati. She also appeared in several Italian TV serials such as _\"Il bene e il male\" (2009) (6 nominations at the Monte Carlo Television Festival 2009) directed by Giorgio Serafini and the second edition of \"Butta la luna\" (2006). Nela worked as well with upcoming young directors such as award winner Francesco Felli (Ogni Giorno) who directed her in the lead role in his short film 'Fuorigioco'. Under direction of prize-winner Salvatore Allocca she played in his document film 'The Charmer of Snakes'. From 2009 (when this biography was first written) to nowadays Nela shot more independent feature films, another TV serial \"Caso di coscienza 5\" and some programs on satellite TV channels. She led the public through the beauties of her native country Bosnia and Herzegowina as well as her former life in it in a very successful documentary 'Radici' (Roots) repeatedly broad casted on Italian Rai TV.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU1YmRkMjEtZmRjMC00MGZhLTkwYTItMWU4YWZlNjU3MjI0L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEyMjk2ODk@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2061826","name":"Nela
