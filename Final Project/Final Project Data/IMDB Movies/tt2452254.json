Now she is being asked to step into the other role, that of the older Helena. She departs with her assistant to rehearse in Sils Maria; a remote region of the Alps. A young Hollywood starlet with a penchant for scandal is to take on the role of Sigrid, and Maria finds herself on the other side of the mirror, face to face with an ambiguously charming woman who is, in essence, an unsettling reflection of herself.","simplePlot":"A film star comes face-to-face with an uncomfortable reflection of herself while starring in a revival of the play that launched her career.","actors":[{"actorName":"Juliette Binoche","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000300","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzI4MDQ5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ5NTc0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 March 1964","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Juliette Binoche was born in Paris, France, to Monique Yvette Stalens, a director, teacher, and actress, and Jean-Marie Binoche, a sculptor, director, and actor. Her mother was born in Czestochowa, Poland, of French, Walloon Belgian, and Polish descent, while her father is French. Juliette was only 23 when she first attracted the attention of international film critics with The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times film critic with an international following of his books on film and TV reviews, wrote that she was \"almost ethereal in her beauty and innocence\". That innocence was gone by the time Binoche completed Louis Malle's Damage (1992) (aka \"Fatale\"). In an interview after the film was released, Binoche said: \"Malle was trying direct and wanted something more sophisticated\". A year later, Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors: Blue (1993) was added to her film credits. After a sabbatical from film-making to become a mother in 1994, Binoche was selected as the heroine of France's most expensive ($35 million) movie ever: The Horseman on the Roof (1995). More recently, she has made The English Patient (1996), for which she won an Oscar for 'Best supporting actress' and Chocolat (2000).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzI4MDQ5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ5NTc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000300","name":"Juliette Binoche","idIMDB":"nm0000300"},"actorId":"nm0000300","character":"Maria Enders","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0440957","main":true},{"actorName":"Kristen Stewart","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829576","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMjUyOTY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI2MjA2Mw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 April 1990","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Kristen Jaymes Stewart","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Though most famous for her role as Isabella \"Bella\" Swan in The Twilight (2008) Saga, Kristen Stewart has been a working actor since her early years in Los Angeles, California, where she was born. Her parents, John Stewart and Jules Stewart, both work in film and television. Her mother is Australian. The family includes three boys, her older brother Cameron Stewart and two adopted brothers Dana and Taylor. After a talent scout caught her grade school performance in a Christmas play at the age of eight, she appeared on television in a few small roles. Her first significant role came when she was cast as Sam Jennings in The Safety of Objects (2001). Soon after that, she starred alongside Jodie Foster in the hit drama, Panic Room (2002) and was nominated for a Young Artist Award. Praised for her Panic Room performance, she went on to join the cast of Cold Creek Manor (2003) as the daughter of Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone. Though the film did not do well at the box office, she received another nomination for a Young Artist Award. After appearing in a handful of movies and a Showtime movie called Speak (2004), Stewart was cast in the role of a teenage singer living in a commune in Sean Penn's Into the Wild (2007), a critically acclaimed biopic. A third Young Artist Award nomination resulted in a win for this role. She also appeared in Mary Stuart Masterson's The Cake Eaters (2007) that same year. Just 17, Stewart took on the starring role in Twilight (2008) which was based on a series of the same name written by Stephenie Meyer, the novel already had a huge following and the film opened to fans anxious to see the vampire romance brought to life. Awarded the MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance, Stewart's turn as Bella continued in the sequels The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009) and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010). The final installments of the series start filming in late 2010. Despite her stratospheric launch into stardom with the Twilight films, she stayed true to her roots by working on a number of indie projects, including Adventureland (2009) (filmed prior to the Twilight series) and Welcome to the Rileys (2010). And she took on the daunting task of playing hard rocker Joan Jett in Floria Sigismondi's The Runaways (2010) alongside Dakota Fanning. Stewart received praise for her acting and musical performances and later won the 2010 BAFTA Rising Star Award and best actress at the Milan International Film Festival for Welcome to the Rileys (2010). Stewart starred in several other movies filmed between the Twilight Saga installments including the #1 summer box office hit, Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), and the Cannes selection Sur la route (2012) A few of Stewart's following projects are: Sundance drama Camp X-Ray (2014), Cannes selection Sils Maria (2014) for which she won a César award, and the Lionsgate distributed action comedy, American Ultra (2015), starring the Adventureland (2009) duo. Stewart continues to live in Los Angeles, California.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMjUyOTY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI2MjA2Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829576","name":"Kristen Stewart","nicknames":["Kris","KStew","Stew"],"idIMDB":"nm0829576"},"actorId":"nm0829576","character":"Valentine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0389126","main":true},{"actorName":"Chloë Grace Moretz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1631269","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2ODk0Mzc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYzMzgzMzE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 February 1997","placeOfBirth":" Atlanta, Georgia, USA","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Chloë Grace Moretz was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Teri (Duke), a nurse, and McCoy Lee Moretz, a plastic surgeon.

Her first movie role was as Molly in Heart of the Beholder (2005), a story about a family that opened the first video rental store in 1980. This was followed by a small role in Family Plan (2005) as Young Charlie. After that, however, came Chloe's biggest role, and the one that made her famous: The Amityville Horror (2005), the remake of the famous The Amityville Horror (1979). Next she landed a small role in Today You Die (2005) as the Little Girl, and has since appeared in Room 6 (2006) and Big Momma's House 2 (2006). She filmed Wicked Little Things (2006) in Bulgaria, in which she plays Emma Tunney. In 2007 she completed The Third Nail (2007), in which she appeared as Hailey Deonte. In 2010 she appeared as Hit-Girl in director Matthew Vaughn's action film Kick-Ass (2010), based on the comic book series of the same name by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. Although her role in the violent action film engendered some controversy, she received widespread critical acclaim for her portrayal. Moretz trained with Jackie Chan's stunt crew for three months prior to filming \"Kick-Ass\" and did most of her own stunts in the film. Also that year she played Abby, a 12-year-old vampire, in Let Me In (2010), the UK/US remake of the Swedish film Let the Right One In (2008), which was released on October 1, 2010.

In 2013 she reprised her role as Hit-Girl in the sequel Kick-Ass 2 (2013), which received mixed reviews, but once again her performance was highly praised. The same year she also appeared in a short segment in Movie 43 (2013) and played the title character in Carrie (2013), a remake of Carrie (1976), based on a Stephen King story and directed by Kimberly Peirce. In January 2013 Moretz was chosen to play Mia in the film adaptation of Gayle Forman's If I Stay (2014), which was released in August 2014. On January 16, 2014, it was announced Moretz would appear in an off-Broadway show directed by Steven Soderbergh entitled \"The Library\".
