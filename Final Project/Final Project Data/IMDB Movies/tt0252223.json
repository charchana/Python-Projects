Izzard worked as a street performer and in smaller comedy venues throughout the mid-to-late 1980s; his big break came when he appeared in Hysteria III, a 1991 AIDS fundraiser held at the London Palladium, and did his now-famous \"Raised by wolves\" sketch. After that, he drew bigger and bigger audiences, and in 1993 hired the Ambassadors Theatre in London's West End for the first of many successful one-man shows. With Eddie Izzard: Live at the Ambassadors (1993), he was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award (outstanding achievement) and won his first British Comedy Award for top stand-up comedian. He returned to the West End the next year with his second one-man show, Eddie Izzard: Unrepeatable (1994), and soon thereafter made his West End debut in a drama, as the lead in the world premiere of David Mamet's \"The Cryptogram\" with Lindsay Duncan; his success led to his second starring role, in \"900 Oneonta\". Izzard appeared in 1995 as the title character in Christopher Marlowe's groundbreaking \"Edward II\". In 1996, he made his big-screen debut alongside Bob Hoskins and Robin Williams in The Secret Agent (1996); he also staged another one-man show, Eddie Izzard: Definite Article (1996), for which he received his second British Comedy Award. He then took \"Definite Article\" to major cities outside the UK, including New York, and returned to the West End with a new show, Eddie Izzard: Glorious (1997), which included a month in New York City at PS122. In 1998, Izzard appeared in another film, Velvet Goldmine (1998), with Ewan McGregor, and also staged his breakthrough one-man U.S. show, Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill (1999) which aired on HBO and earned Izzard two Emmy Awards. Izzard next took on the challenge of appearing as Lenny Bruce in Peter Hall's West End production of \"Lenny.\" Izzard started 2000 touring the world with Eddie Izzard: Circle (2002) and continued to act in films, among them The Criminal (1999); Shadow of the Vampire (2000) with John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe; and Peter Bogdanovich's The Cat's Meow (2001), in which he played Charles Chaplin. He returned to the stage, in London and later in New York (his Broadway debut), with A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (2002), a version of which was televised. In 2003, Izzard was seen on the big screen in Alex Cox's Revengers Tragedy (2002) and on the small screen in a BBC mini-series _40 (2002)(TV)_. His other films include The Avengers (1998), Ocean's Twelve (2004), My Super Ex-Girlfriend (2006), Ocean's Thirteen (2007) and Valkyrie (2008), and he has voiced roles in a handful of movies, including The Wild (2006), The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008) and Cars 2 (2011). Izzard also has appeared in several television series, including a starring role in The Riches (2007), which lasted for two seasons on FX (from 2007-2008), and recurring roles in Hannibal (2013) and United States of Tara (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMTIxNzM0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMwMzcwMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0412850","name":"Eddie Izzard","idIMDB":"nm0412850"},"actorId":"nm0412850","character":"Tony","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Cosmo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181920","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE4MDUzMzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwNDcyMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1948","placeOfBirth":" Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, UK","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"James Cosmo was born on May 24, 1948 in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland.

His entrance was just as dramatic as some of his roles. On the evening of his birth Udo's mother requested extra time with her new baby. The nurses had gathered all of the other babies and returned them to the nursery when the hospital was bombed. He and his mother were rescued from underneath the rubble. Udo didn't know much about his father. When Udo was 18 he moved to Britain in order to learn the English language. While there he took a few acting courses. He was eventually offered a role by director Michael Sarne as a gigolo in the film Road to Saint Tropez (1966). While the role was small, it was the beginning of his career in films. His first \"hit\" film was Mark of the Devil (1970) (Mark of the Devil). The film was rated \"V\" for violence and ticket buyers were offered vomit bags before the film started. It was banned in 31 countries but spawned two sequels (both without Kier). The film is notorious for its exploitation of sex and violence (the uncut version was remastered and re-released on video in 1997). Kier met director Paul Morrissey on an airplane trip. Morrissey offered him the lead role in the 3-D Flesh for Frankenstein (1973). It was this film, along with its sister film Blood for Dracula (1974), that made Udo a cult figure. Both Morrissey films are also known as Andy Warhol's Frankenstein and Dracula; however, Andy Warhol was not involved in the production or creation of the films. Both were rated X when released. One of Kier's most vivid memories from \"Flesh for Frankenstein\" was the infamous \"internal organ\" scene. Real animal organs were used that were left unrefrigerated on the set for several hours. Udo had to pull the organs out of a prop dummy with his bare hands and hold them up to his face. He has said he will never forget that smell. When this film was finished the cast and crew began immediately filming \"Blood for Dracula\". Udo remembers both of these films fondly and regards \"Dracula\" over \"Frankenstein\" as his favorite of the two (in 1996 both films were released by Criterion on DVD totally uncut). In the 1970s some of Kier's work included The Salzburg Connection (1972), The Story of O (1975) (The Story of O), Spermula (1976) and Trauma (1976) (House on Straw Hill). Much of his work has been dubbed with someone else's voice. In Suspiria (1977) there were some technical difficulties with the sound while his scene was shot. In the 1980s some of his work included Lulu (1980), The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Osbourne (1981) (The Blood of Dr Jekyll), The Island of the Bloody Plantation (1983) (Escape from Blood Plantation) and Seduction: The Cruel Woman (1985) (Seduction: The Cruel Woman). In the 1980s Kier did very little work outside of Europe. In the 1990s he had a lot more visibility in America and his breakthrough role was as Hans in My Own Private Idaho (1991) (the soundtrack includes the song that Udo performs in the film). Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993) reunited Kier with his friend Keanu Reeves yet again. Udo was cast as Pamela Anderson's sidekick in Barb Wire (1996) and played Ron Camp in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) opposite Jim Carrey. In the 1990s some of the films he was in included L'hôpital et ses fantômes (1994), For Love or Money (1993), Breaking the Waves (1996), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Blade (1998) and Armageddon (1998). Over his 30-year career Udo has worked with several brilliant directors: Paul Morrissey, Charles Matton, Dario Argento, Gus Van Sant and Walerian Borowczyk. he continues to work often with Lars von Trier and is the godfather of Van Trier's child as well as a good friend. Von Trier is currently working on a film entitled Dimension which is a project that spans 30 years. Every year the cast and crew (including Udo) meet to shoot footage. The film will show the actors age 30 years without make-up or special effects. Approximately seen years of footage has already been shot. The premiere will take place in 2024! Kier's acting career ranges from art house films (Europa (1991)) to gore fests (Blackest Heart (1990) (German Chainsaw Massacre)) to television commercials. He says he loves horror films and wants to do more of them. He enjoys playing villains, as he feels it is more interesting because evil has no limits. Currently Udo lives in California and spends much of his time working in Europe, where he receives larger roles and more recognition.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxODE2MTgwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjYzNTky._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001424","name":"Udo Kier","idIMDB":"nm0001424"},"actorId":"nm0001424","character":"General Landssdorf","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Oliver Korittke","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0466292","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 April 1968","placeOfBirth":" Berlin, Germany","height":"5' 7¾\" (1.72 m)","bio":"Oliver Korittke was born on April 6, 1968 in Berlin, Germany.
