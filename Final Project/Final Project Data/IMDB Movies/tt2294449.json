In the ninth grade he was sent to Catholic school. It was there that he discovered his passion for football and his hopes became centered on earning an athletic college scholarship. Channing's goal was finally met, and in his senior year in high school, he was recruited and earned a full athletic college scholarship to a school in West Virginia. Tatum is also skilled in Kung Fu and in Gor-Chor Kung Fu, a form of martial arts, in which he has earned belts. Channing later left college and, in the meantime, worked as a construction worker, a stripper, a mortgage broker and salesman. He has modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch, Nautica, Gap, Aeropostale, Emporio Armani, and has been featured in television commercials for American Eagle, Pepsi, and some very popular Mountain Dew commercials.

He first came to public notice as a singer and songwriter with the controversial and influential band N.W.A. His compositions with that group included many of the classic cuts from their debut LP \"Straight Outta Compton\" (Ruthless/Priority, 1989), including the title track, \"Gangsta Gangsta\" and \"Express Yourself\". He quit the band over business differences in 1990 and began a still-growing series of commercially and critically acclaimed solo albums, starting with \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted\" (Priority, 1990). His second solo album, \"Death Certificate\" (Priority, 1991), a concept album about the fall and rise of the Black man, sold two million copies, and his subsequent solo output (six albums to date total) has sold over ten million copies. He has also discovered Yoyo, Del, K-Dee and Mack 10. He has also produced, written, toured and recorded with Public Enemy, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, George Clinton, The D.O.C., Michel'e, Big Daddy Kane, WC & The Madd Circle (which spawned the solo career of Coolio), former N.W.A. bandmate Dr. Dre and Cypress Hill. He has also recorded with two post-N.W.A. side-project bands, Da Lench Mob (\"Guerillas In Tha Mist\", Street Knowledge/East-West, 1991) and Westside Connection (\"Bow Down\", Priority, 1996). His movie career has been no less stellar. Ice Cube's debut in Boyz n the Hood (1991) led to more roles in such films as Trespass (1992), Dangerous Ground (1997) and Anaconda (1997). He also appeared as himself in the comedy CB4 (1993). He is also no stranger to the other side of the camera, directing videos for himself as well as Prince and Color Me Badd, as well as co-writing his screenwriting debut, Friday (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyMTE0NDQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDA1NjA1Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001084","name":"Ice Cube","nicknames":["Cube"],"idIMDB":"nm0001084"},"actorId":"nm0001084","character":"Captain Dickson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0295400","main":true},{"actorName":"Keith Lucas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5695570","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Keith Lucas is an actor and writer, known for 22 Jump Street (2014), Lucas Bros Moving Co (2013) and Lucas Brothers: The Nixon Special (2017).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5695570","name":"Keith Lucas","idIMDB":"nm5695570"},"actorId":"nm5695570","character":"Keith Yang","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0449316","main":true},{"actorName":"Kenneth Lucas","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3584219","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1ODMyODg4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcwMzQwOTE@._V1_UY44_CR5,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Kenneth Lucas is an actor and writer, known for Lucas Bros Moving Co (2013), 22 Jump Street (2014) and Lady Dynamite (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1ODMyODg4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcwMzQwOTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3584219","name":"Kenneth Lucas","idIMDB":"nm3584219"},"actorId":"nm3584219","character":"Kenny Yang","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nick Offerman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0644406","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMjY2ODkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQxMDA5MTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 June 1970","placeOfBirth":" Joliet, Illinois, USA","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Nick Offerman was born on June 26, 1970 in Joliet, Illinois, USA.
