Her mother moved to the U.S. in 1951, from Greenock, Scotland. Her father, from Burlington, New Jersey, has German, Irish, German-Jewish, and English ancestry. Moore spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents, during her father's military career. She finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), She took the stage name \"Julianne Moore\" because there was another actress named \"Julie Anne Smith\". Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress' trap of the mid-1980's: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial The Edge of Night (1956) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap As the World Turns (1956). This performance later led to an Outstanding Ingénue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as Money, Power, Murder. (1989), The Last to Go (1991) and Cast a Deadly Spell (1991). She made her entrance into the big screen with 1990's Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992) and the comedy The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag (1992). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as a doctor who spots Kimble Harrison Ford and attempts to thwart his escape in The Fugitive (1993). (A role that made such an impression on Steven Spielberg that he cast her in the Jurassic Park (1993) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore's most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her \"beguiling Yelena\" from Andre Gregory's workshop version of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in Louis Malle's critically acclaimed Vanya on 42nd Street (1994). Director Todd Haynes gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in Safe (1995). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Later that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as Hugh Grant's pregnant girlfriend in Nine Months (1995). Following films included Assassins (1995), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas) and Surviving Picasso (1996), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, Anthony Hopkins). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg's The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), opposite Jeff Goldblum, a young and unknown director, Paul Thomas Anderson asked Julianne to appear in his movie, Boogie Nights (1997). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in The Big Lebowski (1998), continued with a small role in the social comedy Chicago Cab (1997) and ended with a subtle performance in Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho (1960). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be. She starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune (1999) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged Glenn Close. A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in Oliver Parker's An Ideal Husband (1999) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in Magnolia (1999) and continued with an outstanding performance in The End of the Affair (1999), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination. She ended 1999 with another great performance, that of a grieving mother in A Map of the World (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NDI1MjE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE0Nzk0MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000194","name":"Julianne Moore","nicknames":["Juli"],"idIMDB":"nm0000194"},"actorId":"nm0000194","character":"Havana Segrand","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0406818","main":true},{"actorName":"Mia Wasikowska","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1985859","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNzI0MDczN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ0MjMxOTE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 October 1989","placeOfBirth":" Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Mia is an Australian actress, born and raised in the country's capital, Canberra.

Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John's siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago's Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall's geek brigade in Sixteen Candles (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like The Sure Thing (1985) and Better Off Dead... (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything... (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in The Grifters (1990). The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins' Actors' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack's high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime's first feature was the sharply written comedy Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film's financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack's next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case. Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby's popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he's so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He's also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn't reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTAwMjYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxNTU1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131","name":"John Cusack","nicknames":["Johnny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000131"},"actorId":"nm0000131","character":"Dr. Stafford Weiss","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0449475","main":true},{"actorName":"Evan Bird","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3909032","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NDI0MzAzOTReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDE2MDY5NTc@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Evan Bird is an actor, known for Maps to the Stars (2014), Chained (2012) and The Killing (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NDI0MzAzOTReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDE2MDY5NTc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3909032","name":"Evan Bird","idIMDB":"nm3909032"},"actorId":"nm3909032","character":"Benjie Weiss","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0449477","main":true},{"actorName":"Olivia Williams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931404","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MzczNjQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1MzIzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 July 1968","placeOfBirth":" Camden Town, London, England, UK","birthName":"Olivia Haigh Williams","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Olivia Williams was born July 26, 1968 in Camden Town, London.

Only weeks after signing with an agent she landed a role in a Warner Bros. pilot, Chasing Alice, playing the title character as a young girl. While the pilot did not result in a series, the experience served Niamh well as she moved on to work in commercials, TV and film. The 2005 Lifetime TV original movie Haunting Sarah was Niamh's first challenging role. Director Ralph Hemecker remembered Niamh from his pilot, Chasing Alice, and cast her as a young girl haunted by the spirit of her cousin in this supernatural thriller. The result won Niamh a Best Supporting Actress in a MOW Young Artist Award in 2006 for Haunting Sarah. By the time she was in middle school she'd portrayed a ghost and an alien, been haunted, possessed, kidnapped and blown up. Over a decade of screen credits include Saw 3 through 6, The Marsh, and MOW such as Haunting Sarah (for which she won a Young Artist Award for best supporting Actress in a MOW at age eight) episodic appearances in Heartland, RookieBlue, Flashpoint, Falling Skies, Haven, My Babysitter is a Vampire,Warehouse 13, Hemlock Grove, Between, The Good Witch, the web series Inhuman Condition, and MOW Early Release. Comedic roles eluded Niamh until she landed the title role in Cookie Jar Entertainment's tween-oriented sitcom Debra! (for which she won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series - Leading Young Actress and Outstanding Young Ensemble in a TV Series in 2011.) Niamh takes a very craft-driven approach to her work, believing every member of the production team is critical to the final outcome of the project. Without the interconnection of talented crew and actors, her own efforts would not succeed. Her role as fame-hungry Gracie in Jean Pierre Jeunet's The Young and Prodigious T. S.
