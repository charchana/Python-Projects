Her parents divorced when she was young; she was the second of five children. She attended Cranleigh, a private school, and showed interest in theatrics way back then. Her grandparents were artists, and she initially intended to be one herself, but after one year of art school, she renewed her dedication to acting and transferred to Webber-Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where she graduated in 1988. She subsequently appeared in the play \"Wuthering Heights\" as Catherine, where she met her Heathcliff both onstage and in real life, actor Rory Edwards. In 1989 she won the London Drama Critic's Award for her performance in \"Faith, Hope and Charity\" as \"best newcomer.\" Her marriage to actor Edwards, who also appeared with her in the TV-movie Young Catherine (1991), in which she played Catherine the Great, dissipated in 1994. In the meantime she slowly built up her reputation as a fine actress with the films The Baby of Mâcon (1993) and Captives (1994), but Hollywood finally took notice with her lauded support role in Legends of the Fall (1994) opposite Brad Pitt. As a result of this, she was practically handed Audrey Hepburn's role in the revival of Sabrina (1995), stealing the picture from co-star Harrison Ford. She has since continued to glow in such international pictures as Smilla's Sense of Snow (1997), Le barbier de Sibérie (1998) [The Barber of Siberia] and Resistance (2003), and in such TV mini-series showcases as Iron Jawed Angels (2004).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMjU1NzQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzYxODgzMTI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000566","name":"Julia Ormond","idIMDB":"nm0000566"},"actorId":"nm0000566","character":"Eustacia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0457143","main":true},{"actorName":"David Strathairn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000657","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3MjI5MDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwNDM3NQ@@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 January 1949","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"David Russell Strathairn","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"David Russell Strathairn was born on January 26, 1949 in San Francisco, California. He is the son of Mary Frances (Frazier), a nurse, and Thomas Scott Strathairn, Jr., a physician. He has two siblings, Tom and Anne. His ancestry includes English, Scottish, Irish, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and one sixteenth Chinese (the latter three from his paternal grandmother). Strathairn attended Williams College, where he demonstrated great interest in the theater, and first befriended John Sayles, with whom he would later frequently collaborate. Strathairn graduated college and traveled to Florida to visit with his grandfather, but the grandfather passed away while Strathairn was en route. Strathairn, finding himself freshly-arrived and without friends in Florida, decided instead to join the Ringling Brothers Clown College and subsequently worked as a clown for six months in a traveling circus. Relocating to New York State, he spent several years hitchhiking across America to work in local theaters during the summers. During one of these summers Strathairn reunited with Sayles, and this eventually resulted in his role in the highly regarded Return of the Secaucus Seven (1979), Sayle's directorial debut. Thereafter Strathairn developed an extensive resume of supporting roles, which became increasingly substantial as his stature in the industry grew; notable films include Lovesick (1983), Silkwood (1983), L.A. Confidential (1997), and A Map of the World (1999). Sayles frequently casts Strathairn, whose performances can be seen in Sayles' The Brother from Another Planet (1984), Matewan (1987), Eight Men Out (1988), City of Hope (1991), and Passion Fish (1992). Perhaps most notable of his collaborations with Sayles is his superb performance co-starring with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in Limbo (1999). After a string of successful supporting roles in the early 2000s, Strathairn found himself thrust into the role of leading man with his performance as Edward R. Murrow in George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005) Taking on the role of the iconic newsman in the black-and-white drama, Strathairn garnered numerous award mentions including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Following the success of that film, Strathairn traveled easily between low-budget independent films - The Notorious Bettie Page (2005), The Sensation of Sight (2006), My Blueberry Nights (2007), and Howl (2010) among them - and big-budget Hollywood productions, including We Are Marshall (2006), The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008), both The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Steven Spielberg's biopic Lincoln (2012), in which he plays Secretary of State William Seward. Strathairn has also worked extensively in television, and first became familiar to television viewers as the title character's boss in the series The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd (1987). In addition to narration work for many PBS shows, Strathairn has appeared in the TV series Big Apple (2001), The Sopranos (1999), Monk (2002), and heads the cast of the science-fiction series Alphas (2011). His work in television films has brought him an Emmy Award for Temple Grandin (2010) and an Emmy nominations for Hemingway & Gellhorn (2012). Strathairn married Logan Goodman in 1980, and the couple have two children.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3MjI5MDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgwNDM3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000657","name":"David Strathairn","idIMDB":"nm0000657"},"actorId":"nm0000657","character":"Dr. Carlock","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0408619","main":true},{"actorName":"Catherine O'Hara","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001573","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MzA0NjYwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODk4NTE2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 March 1954","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Catherine Anne O'Hara","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Born March 4, 1954 in Ontario, Canada.

Born in Snyder, Texas on February 13, 1963, he was World Champion Jr. Bull Rider, then broadened his horizons by lassoing an acting career to boot. Graduating from Snyder High School in 1981, he began his stage training in San Francisco and showed enough chutzpah to try Hollywood in the mid 1980s. He initially drew attention on TV series work and in topical mini-movies dealing with sensitive issues. Following a regular role on the short-lived baseball ensemble series Bay City Blues (1983) and a recurring one as a rookie cop on Hill Street Blues (1981), he showed extreme promise as both a shy homosexual who comes out to his parents and faces the repercussions therein in Consenting Adult (1985), and as a preppy corporate upstart involved in murder in Billionaire Boys Club (1987). Barry peaked, however, playing Jasper Fant in the epic westerns Lonesome Dove (1989) and its sequel Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), which were partially set in his native Texas. Once he cemented his reputation on TV, Barry gravitated towards film with supporting roles in Mask (1985), The Legend of Billie Jean (1985) and as Wolfman in Top Gun (1986). In 1988, he co-starred with Mary Tyler Moore and Lynn Redgrave appearing fully nude in the Broadway production of \"Sweet Sue\" by A. R. Gurney which had a respectable run of 164 performances. The tall, fair-looking fellow with a slight but appealing awkwardness eventually grew disenchanted with Hollywood and turned to independent filming as well as other interests. At one point he actually moved to France (1991-93) and rode in a the resurrection of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Spreading his wings to include off-camera activity, he starred, directed, produced and co-wrote the real cowboy and Indians low-budget Blood Trail (2005), and soon Barry returned to his youthful roots writing, producing and directing the family film Grand Champion (2002), the exploits a young boy who raises a prize-winning steer and struggles to save the steer from becoming a prize bbq. He shot the film in his own hometown of Snyder. He has since written, produced and directed the ridiculous comedy \"Clown Hunt\" and directed the paranormal thriller \"Javelina\". Apparently he is mounting a feature production called \"the dream...\" to be shot in Marfa, Texas 2017.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NDI0NzI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMwMTkwODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875613","name":"Barry Tubb","idIMDB":"nm0875613"},"actorId":"nm0875613","character":"Randy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0457140","main":true},{"actorName":"Melissa Farman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2957199","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyNzIxOTM0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM2NTY0NzE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1990","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","bio":"Melissa never knew her mother Jackie's famous godmother (the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis), but she learned all about the world of celebrity politics after playing Bristol Palin in the HBO telefilm Game Change. The HBO project starred Julianne Moore, Woody Harrelson and Ed Harris. Melissa, who is of French, British and Italian descent, was born in New York City and raised in Paris, France, far away from Wasilla, Alaska, where the abstinence activist she portrayed was reared. Melissa's parents and their families were instrumental in the world of early aviation and they wanted their daughter to (figuratively) embrace the open skies, too. Having a near-photographic memory, Melissa excelled in academics (graduated with top honors), but she was drawn to the world of art, as well. She studied ballet and jazz and connected especially to poetry at an early age after being assigned to read Victor Hugo's Tomorrow, at Dawn, which deals with the poet's feelings about the untimely death of his daughter. Others began to recognize Melissa's early wisdom and maturity. At age ten, she was accepted into the exclusive Bilingual Acting Workshop for professional actors in Paris. When she was 13, Melissa spent a year at a boarding school in Boston in order to improve her English. Melissa combined her love of the arts and her sense of pragmatism by studying the challenging language of Mandarin Chinese while she was still in high school. Melissa is fluent in three languages; English, French and Spanish. Raised with a younger brother and surrounded by four male cousins, Melissa learned to hold her own athletically. She still enjoys tennis, skiing and the occasional skydive. Melissa postponed her business studies at the University of Pennsylvania to explore artistic endeavors in Los Angeles. She was about to return to the university when a manager, who discovered her in an acting class, urged her to remain in Hollywood a bit longer. The actress soon earned her Screen Actors Guild card after being cast as a young (and pregnant) Danielle Rousseau on the hit ABC series Lost. Other roles on Law & Order: SVU, Cold Case and NCIS quickly followed. Next, Melissa played opposite Claire Danes in HBO's award-winning Temple Grandin, portraying Alice, Temple's blind college roommate. \"Alice's blindness provided a bridge between the two characters,\" Melissa says. \"Temple [who has highly functioning autism] communicates without looking Alice in the eye, a huge relief and comfort that Temple is not permitted to have with others.\" Two of Melissa's favorite actresses are Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska. As she continues to take on a diversity of roles as one of Hollywood's rising young talents, Melissa is determined to continue her education, knowing it will enrich her work as an actress. She's currently enrolled in the University of Southern California's Thematic Option Honors Program, majoring in Political Science and English Literature.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyNzIxOTM0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM2NTY0NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2957199","name":"Melissa Farman","idIMDB":"nm2957199"},"actorId":"nm2957199","character":"Alice","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0457139","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Shearer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790461","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1ODE3OTg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ5NDA5NzE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Steve Shearer is an actor, known for Temple Grandin (2010), Lazer Team (2015) and Dark Places (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1ODE3OTg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ5NDA5NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790461","name":"Steve Shearer","idIMDB":"nm0790461"},"actorId":"nm0790461","character":"Jeff Brown","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0457138","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Dillard","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0226844","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Richard Dillard is an actor, known for The Last Stand (2013), Temple Grandin (2010) and Dazed and Confused (1993).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0226844","name":"Richard Dillard","idIMDB":"nm0226844"},"actorId":"nm0226844","character":"Don Micheals","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0457137","main":true},{"actorName":"Jenna Hughes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3717467","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jenna Hughes is an actress, known for Temple Grandin (2010), Being in Heaven (2009) and Packed to the Rafters (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3717467","name":"Jenna Hughes","idIMDB":"nm3717467"},"actorId":"nm3717467","character":"Four-Year-Old Temple","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0182762","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Crabtree","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185611","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Michael Crabtree is an actor and director, known for Temple Grandin (2010), The Life of David Gale (2003) and Tender Mercies (1983).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185611","name":"Michael Crabtree","idIMDB":"nm0185611"},"actorId":"nm0185611","character":"Uncle Mike","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charles Baker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1889973","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5OTMzNzkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMzNzY0MjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 February 1971","placeOfBirth":" Washington, District of Columbia, USA","birthName":"Charles Edward Baker","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Born February 27, 1971 in Washington, DC and raised in Hawaii, Charles has lived a life most people write books about.
