At age three, she began to study dance - tap, ballet, jazz and modern. After responding to an ad in the Washington Post, she made her stage debut at 9 as \"Dill\" in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". Soon she became a regular on local DC stages. Acting took a back seat when Eileen Ford discovered Melissa in a Manhattan jewelry store at the age of 14. Modeling took her to New York and Paris. Soon she left Paris and followed through with her initial desire to go to The University of Virginia and resume a \"normal\" student life studying Art History. When she decided to return to acting full time, she began studying at The Stella Adler Conservatory, NYU's Stonestreet Studio and at the Michael Howard Studio. Her professional life as an actor began shortly thereafter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI0NzA3NTg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzgwOTI4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756089","name":"Melissa Sagemiller","idIMDB":"nm0756089"},"actorId":"nm0756089","character":"Elizabeth","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brad Rowe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005388","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMjY1OTI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjkxNDE0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 May 1970","placeOfBirth":" Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","birthName":"Bradley Thomas Rowe","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Brad Rowe was born on May 15, 1970 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA as Bradley Thomas Rowe.

After his parents divorced, he was raised by his father. In 1983, he got his first taste of stand-up comedy when he performed at open microphone nights at the University of Iowa. Tom's comedy career had its ups and downs over the next several years until 1988, when he entered the Minneapolis Comedy Competition and won first place. With this victory in hand, he decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue a stand-up comedy career. Once he hit Los Angeles, things happened fast. That same year, he was hired as a staff writer for Roseanne Barr's TV sitcom Roseanne (1988) and began to appear regularly on the show as \"Arnie Thomas\". He and Roseanne Barr were married in 1990, with Arnold converting to Judaism prior to the marriage. They formed Rapello County Productions to develop projects for themselves. The couple's marriage, together with their sometimes outrageous behavior, attracted media attention - and especially that of the tabloids - like a magnet. In 1994 conditions between the two deteriorated and they went through a very public, and acrimonious, divorce. Tom has been married twice since then and is the co-host of Fox Sports Net's talk show The Best Damn Sports Show Period (2001). He also does voiceover work, and provides the voice for the \"Oven Mitt\" character in the TV commercials for the Arby's restaurant chain.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NTYzNzMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc2NzgzMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000792","name":"Tom Arnold","idIMDB":"nm0000792"},"actorId":"nm0000792","character":"Charles","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marliss Amiea","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2177160","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjkzYjg0MzAtNjhlOC00ZTM2LWFlZjktOWU1ZWQ5ZmRmNGRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIwOTA0Mzg@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Marliss Amiea is an actress, known for The Christmas Gift (2015), 12 Wishes of Christmas (2011) and The Wish List (2010).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjkzYjg0MzAtNjhlOC00ZTM2LWFlZjktOWU1ZWQ5ZmRmNGRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIwOTA0Mzg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2177160","name":"Marliss Amiea","idIMDB":"nm2177160"},"actorId":"nm2177160","character":"Ally","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Eddie Deezen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0214430","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA5ODkzMDQyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI5ODAzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 March 1957","placeOfBirth":" Cumberland, Maryland, USA","birthName":"Edward Harry Dezen","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Eddie Deezen was born on March 6, 1957 in Cumberland, Maryland, USA as Edward Harry Dezen.
