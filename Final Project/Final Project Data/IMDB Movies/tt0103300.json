Famed for her tiny, slim body and disproportionately large implanted breasts, and the lengths she goes to to hide her assets. Her film roles often show self deprecating humour. She knows why she's there, she know's what you want to see, but through cleverly contrived camera angles you never ever see what she promises you might - the famed \"Yip Tease\". There have long been numerous rumours of an eminent return to movies which have yet to come to fruition.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001867","name":"Amy Yip","idIMDB":"nm0001867"},"actorId":"nm0001867","character":"Helena Wong Ha","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fui-On Shing","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793008","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 February 1955","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong [now Hong Kong, China]","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Fui-On Shing was born on February 1, 1955 in Hong Kong.

After entering th entertainment industry, Gigi first started out as a singer, she released many albums during the 1990s, in both Cantonese and Mandarin. Gigi has made several box office hits, especially for her role as the innocent and stuttering \"Smartie\" in the popular Young and Dangerous movies.

A beautiful young girl, it didn't take long for photographers and agents to notice her and she began modeling at 15. In 1990 she entered the Miss Asia beauty pageant. She didn't win, but her striking looks, lithe body and classy bearing attracted the attention of several producers in Hong Kong's adult film industry. At age 18 she made her adult-film debut and her enthusiastic performances shot her to the top of the Chinese porn field. In 1997 she hooked up with a much older man, a Taiwanese millionaire, and they had a short (two-year) but stormy relationship. After their break-up in 1999, Chan's personal and professional lives began to unravel. She had had a drug problem for several years and it got worse--during one television interview in which she was apparently high on drugs she actually tried to commit suicide. A series of brushes with the law ensued, resulting in her being deported from several countries, and she was briefly sent to prison in the UK for assault. These and other incidents pretty much pulled the plug on her film career. She moved back to her hometown of Shanghai and in July of 2002 gave birth to a baby boy. Motherhood didn't solve her problems, however, and on July 31, 2002, she leaped out of the window of her 24th-floor apartment and plunged to her death.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0151065","name":"Pauline Chan","idIMDB":"nm0151065"},"actorId":"nm0151065","character":"Linda","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Patrick Hon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3062826","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Patrick Hon is an actor, known for Les associés (1991), Mi qing te jing (1995) and Shou ju qing (1988).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3062826","name":"Patrick Hon","idIMDB":"nm3062826"},"actorId":"nm3062826","character":"Handsome Chu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dennis Chan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0150862","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1949","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong","bio":"Born in 1949 in Hong Kong, Dennis Chan Kwok-sun is the younger brother of actor-director Philip Chan.
