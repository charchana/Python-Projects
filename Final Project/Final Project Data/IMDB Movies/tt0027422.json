The fact is that he was British to the core, having been born and raised in Yorkshire and educated in Halifax. He began his acting career on the stage in 1923, specializing in works by William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw. His film debut came in the Tod Slaughter melodrama Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn (1935) as, oddly enough, a Gypsy. Portman became a favorite of renowned filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, leading to a role he is probably best remembered for--the determined Nazi commander of a German U-boat sunk off the coast of Canada in 49th Parallel (1941), who tries to lead his crew across Canada in order to get to the safety of the US, which was at the time not involved in the war. His versatility was obvious in a film he made the next year, One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942) as an RAF officer who finds himself stranded in Nazi-occupied Holland. Portman kept busy over the next 25 years in a variety of roles, as villain and hero, in both thrillers and dramas. After making Deadfall (1968) he retired, apart from a few television projects over the next year or so. He died in 1969 of heart problems.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2NzQ3NTYtNTY3OC00ZmQzLThhYTAtMTMzOWRjNTIzYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692439","name":"Eric Portman","idIMDB":"nm0692439"},"actorId":"nm0692439","character":"Giuliano de Medici","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0489351","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Atkins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0040644","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 August 1886","placeOfBirth":" Dulwich, England, UK","bio":"Robert Atkins was born on August 10, 1886 in Dulwich, England.

Her father, Fred Duprez, was an American vaudevillian who found stage and film work in England. She herself picked up an interest in performing and eventually joined the Coventry Repertory Company to gather the necessary stage experience. June made her film debut as an extra in 1935. She married at a young age and her career was initially encouraged by her first husband, a Harley Street doctor. However, once she started flirting with stardom, he became increasingly envious and possessive and their marriage fell apart. Her sultry and exotic appearances in such British films as The Spy in Black (1939), The Four Feathers (1939) and, especially, Alexander Korda's The Thief of Bagdad (1940) made a star out of her and she was quickly ushered to Hollywood to capitalize on this newly-found fame. Although she stayed in America throughout WWII, both Korda and June's agent set her price too high--at $50,000 per picture. This pretty much put her out of contention and she found herself working very little in the next few years. Her most notable American picture during that time was None But the Lonely Heart (1944) opposite Cary Grant. June subsequently left Hollywood in 1946 and took a few roles on the Broadway stage. She retired altogether when she married for a second time in 1948 to a well-to-do sportsman. They had two daughters but divorced in 1965. June lived in Rome for a time, then returned to London to live out the remainder of her life. She died in 1984 at age 66 following an extended illness.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU2NzQ0NjUtMzM2Yi00ZDEyLThiM2ItMjE4ZjM2ODg3NDRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0243454","name":"June Duprez","idIMDB":"nm0243454"},"actorId":"nm0243454","character":"Francesca Monterosa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Henrietta Watson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0914651","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 March 1873","placeOfBirth":" Dundee, Scotland, UK","bio":"Henrietta Watson was born on March 11, 1873 in Dundee, Scotland.
