Her mother, Mirtha Medeiros, decided to become an actress after Elli was born, & when she was admitted into Uruguay's Escuela National, had to take her along, so Elli attended drama school & classes by Spanish teacher Pepe Struch before kindergarden. Mirtha graduated and quickly became a very busy actress and Elli was regularly hired each time a child was needed in a play or a TV show. Her first part, at age 4, was Mme Butterfly's son, in the production of Puccini's opera at the Montevideo Opera. This was Orson Welles' first role, at the same age. Elli's father, José Luis Medeiros, vanished from her life when she was five. Elli attended the Uruguyan American School, and when her mother remarried & moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, she attended the Instituto Bayard, a British school. When she was fourteen, her mother & step father moved to Paris, and she had to learn French in a couple of months so she could attend high school. She tried several schools, including an art schoot, l'Ecole des Arts Appliquées, but dropped out before getting a \"baccalauréat\" to start her first band, the Stinky Toys, the first French punk band, playing several London punk Festivals along with the Clash & the Sex Pistols. Elli appeared on the cover of 'Melody Maker' & that convinced the until then extremely reluctant French record companies to sign them a deal. After two albums, the Stinky Toys split and Elli and Stinky Toy Jacno then released several albums as the techno pop duo 'Elli & Jacno'. Their last was Les nuits de la pleine lune (1984), the score to Éric Rohmer's movie. Elli then went solo, her music becoming more personal, more Latin and had several hits in France, including Toi mon Toit, mega hit of 1986, now a standard. After a break, Elli decided to go back to acting & school, & worked with 'Andreas Voutsinas', who was Lee Strasberg's assistant for twenty years and created the Paris \"Actor's Studio\", le Théatre des Cinquante. She also took classes with Madeleine Barchevska and Bob Mc Andrew.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1ODI4MzU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjYzMjcy._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0575468","name":"Elli Medeiros","idIMDB":"nm0575468"},"actorId":"nm0575468","character":"Bijou","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Barbora Bobulova","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0090469","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MTg4NzA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM5MjYzOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 April 1974","placeOfBirth":" Martin, Czechoslovakia [now Slovakia]","bio":"Born in Martin, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia) in 1974, Barbora Bobulova graduated from the Academy of Dramatic Arts of Bratislava and briefly studied in New York before moving to Italy in the mid-1990s.

In the early thirties, for instance, she told poems by Jacques Prévert while the poet was not famous yet. She followed René Simon's drama course and debuted on the stage by playing sketches in a revue at Agnès Capri's cabaret. Some time later Jacques de Casembroot noticed her and presented her to filmmaker Henri Calef, which resulted in in an important role in \"Jericho\", one of the best post-war films about the French Resistance. In the same field, she played Monique Martin, the daughter of an ordinary Resistant in \"Le Père tranquille\", by and with Noël-Noël, a man she had known from her childhood. She made a good number of movies until 1952 but her appearances became more and more sparse because she privileged the theater.On the other hand she was a very active dubber, lending her distinguished voice to such stars as Kim Novak, Joan Collins, Elsa Martinelli, Eleanor Parker, Maureen O'Hara, Ava Gardner, Barbara Stanwyck...(the list could go on forever!). And television has kept her very busy as well with about seventy TV films, serials or series episodes. One of her most moving recent performances (at age 78) is the role of Adèle in Vincent Monnet's \"Adèle et Kamel\".","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0016054","name":"Nadine Alari","idIMDB":"nm0016054"},"actorId":"nm0016054","character":"Ada Vanini","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brigitte Roüan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0747690","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 September 1946","placeOfBirth":" Toulon, Var, France","bio":"Brigitte Roüan was born on September 28, 1946 in Toulon, Var, France.
