After studying politics and sociology at the University of Düsseldorf for two years and an apprenticeship as dressmaker, she was hired by newborn TV music channel VIVA in 1993 and hosted popular shows such as Interaktiv (1993). Also presenting the charts show Bravo TV (1993), the media considered her the prototype of a \"girlie girl\". Her first appearance in a movie, Jailbirds (1996), surprised the critics and slowly changed her image. In the following years, she played leading characters in successful projects such as Am I Beautiful? (1998) and Gripsholm (2000). Living in London from 1999 to 2005, she also appeared in English language movies, most prominently Love Actually (2003). After another convincing performance on Margarete, le génie d'une femme (2005), she is considered a respected actress anyway. In 2009 she played the main role in 'Hilde', the biographical movie about the famous German actress/singer Hildegard Knef. Her performance was a tour de force.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1NjgyMTQ4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ2MTAzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0538443","name":"Heike Makatsch","idIMDB":"nm0538443"},"actorId":"nm0538443","character":"Emilia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Benno Fürmann","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299811","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNjY0NjE5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY0NjMzOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 January 1972","placeOfBirth":" Kreuzberg, Berlin, Germany","birthName":"Benjamin Fürmann","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Benno Fürmann was born on 17 January 1972 in Berlin, Germany and worked as a waiter, bouncer and drifter before attending acting lessons at the Lee Strasberg Institute in New York.
