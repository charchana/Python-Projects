His journey through the entertainment industry has been as eclectic as it has been promising. Furthermore, Kenny has established himself as a sought-after actor/model in Tokyo, Japan with aspirations to transcend his career internationally. While growing up in Buffalo, New York, Kenny dreamed of being an architect and attended Hutchinson Central Technical High School (Hutch Tech) where he studied Building Design. During that time he excelled at cross country and track, was a member of the National Honors Society and the Kappa Sigma Phi Fraterninty, and by his senior year in 1996 he earned many honors for school service, athletics, as well as an award for 4-year perfect attendance. When he decided to attend Union College (Schenectady, New York), Kenny changed direction and majored in History and later pursued a minor in Studio/Visual Arts. Kenny continued to run cross country and after finishing the 1998 season he went on a term abroad. At his host college, Bond University in Queensland, Australia, he met people from all over the world but struck up a special friendship with an Australian student who would later urge him to travel to Japan to teach English. Kenny arrived in Japan in January 2001, with modest goals - learn Japanese, work for a year, and then return back to New York. However, he found that his looks would take him in yet another direction. A fellow in his Japanese class asked him if he had thought about modeling, saying the agencies in Tokyo were always searching for a \"foreign\" look. On his day off, Kenny visited eight or nine freelance agencies, and within a week had his first job, portraying a runner in a documentary being made about the 1964 Olympics in Japan. Since his adventure began 14 years ago, Kenny has participated in fashion shows, posed for numerous commercials and ads, appeared on CD covers, did music videos, and portrayed various characters on Japanese TV dramas and movies. Despite being in demand and his busy schedule, Kenny has managed to take some time off to partake in his favorite diversion - international travel. He has enjoyed his globe-trotting lifestyle in various parts of the world including Vietnam, Austria, Hong Kong, London, and more recently, Turkey. Kenny's looks, creativity, diverse background, and passion for his career is what sets him a part - and makes him an exciting talent to keep an eye out for.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2967579","name":"Kenny Scott","idIMDB":"nm2967579"},"actorId":"nm2967579","character":"Sam Rivera","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lana Lesley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1395932","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Lana Lesley is an actress, known for Gun Crazy: Episode 1 - A Woman from Nowhere (2002), Lost Universe (1998) and Holy Hell (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1395932","name":"Lana Lesley","idIMDB":"nm1395932"},"actorId":"nm1395932","character":"Saki","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Mary J.
