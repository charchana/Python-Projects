He wrote some lyrics for a Danish movie \"Fidibus\", which is where Roland came in contact with the movie business. Ten years after his release from jail, Roland got his first part in \"R\", starring Pilou Asbæk from hit TV series \"Game of Thrones\" and other Hollywood productions. Roland's role in \"R\" was not far from himself, due to the character, which was an inmate called \"The Mason\", the story's main antagonist. Since \"R\", Roland has been typecast as a bad-ass criminal, until his 2016 role in \"Under Sandet\" (\"Land of Mine\"). The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language film category. In 2017 Roland went from hardcore criminal acts to investigator in the action thriller \"Underverden\", starring Dar Salim, another Danish actor from \"Game of Thrones\".
