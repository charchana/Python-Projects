Known for movies like Species (1995) and The Whole Nine Yards (2000), she started her career as a model in Paris, France at the tender age of 15. After leaving home to begin her modeling career in the highly-competitive Paris fashion world, she landed her first cover of French Cosmopolitan and graced the covers of many international fashion magazines, appearing in commercials for Oil of Olay, Lady Stetson and Old Spice. Seeking a greater challenge, Natasha pursued her love of acting and, at only 19, landed the starring role of the science-fiction thriller Species (1995), opposite Sir Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker. The film became a worldwide hit critically and commercially and Natasha received praise for her performance as the genetically-modified Sil, including an MTV Award. Not since the Hitchcock era had someone redefined the \"femme fatale\" for a new generation. This began a recognized film career that has spanned over 35 movies to date. From conquering comedy with Bruce Willis in The Whole Nine Yards (2000) to taking the action-heroine lead in John Carpenter's science-fiction thriller Ghosts of Mars (2001), Natasha has proved herself to be a versatile and fearless actress. She won the Best Actress Gemini Award (Canada's equivalent of an Emmy Award) for her hard-hitting portrayal of a policeman's wife in the miniseries Would Be Kings (2008) and starred with Geena Davis in the Golden Globe-winning series Commander in Chief (2005). Her television credits include leading roles in hit series and She Spies (2002) and Eli Stone (2008), and voicing Miss Ellen on South Park (1997). Recently, she returned to movies, starring with Paul Sorvino and Joe Mantegna in the forthcoming period drama The Bronx Bull (2016), playing the wife of legendary boxer Jake LaMotta. Natasha is the youngest actress to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Temecula Film Festival, and recently was honored with the Queen Elizabeth II Award from her homeland of Canada. Natasha is married to actor and platinum-selling recording artist Darius Campbell and they live in Los Angeles, California with her two children Tristan, 14, and Asher, 11. They enjoy skiing and traveling the world, and are involved in humanitarian efforts including St Jude Children's Research Hospital, World Vision and Fresh2o water charity. Natasha also divides her time between the two coasts, as she continues to be in demand as a model, while pursuing a blossoming career as an actress.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyNDEyMjUyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ4Mjk3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000449","name":"Natasha Henstridge","idIMDB":"nm0000449"},"actorId":"nm0000449","character":"Julie Johnson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jamie Kennedy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005085","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBmN2YzMDMtYjRmZi00YmUwLTk1ZWItMTg3NzIwYTFhYTRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjkyMzQ0MTQ@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 May 1970","placeOfBirth":" Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"James Harvey Kennedy","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"James Harvey Kennedy was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, on May 25, 1970.
