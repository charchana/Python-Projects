He's odd: seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, in denial about personal facts, and convinced he's at war with Satan. The rectory is a half-way house for recently paroled convicts. Adam arrives for 12 weeks, a large, tough neo-Nazi, first baffled by Ivan's thick-headed optimism, then angry. He vows to break Ivan's faith. Meanwhile, in exasperation at Ivan's insistence, Adam sets a personal goal: to bake an apple pie. All goes awry for the tree: crows, worms, lightening. The Book of Job gives Adam perverse insight, and his hooligan mates provide the resolution's spring.","simplePlot":"A neo-nazi sentenced to community service at a church clashes with the blindly devotional priest.","actors":[{"actorName":"Ulrich Thomsen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0860947","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwNjE0MjQ0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDEyNjA3MDE@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 December 1963","placeOfBirth":" Odense, Denmark","height":"5' 10¾\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Ulrich Thomsen graduated from The Danish National School of Theatre and Contemporary Dance in 1993, after which playing on several theaters in Copenhagen, i.e. Dr. Dantes Aveny, Mungo Park and Østre Gasværks Teater.

It is Paprika Steen's first major part for which she has already been nominated for The Best Actress Award from the European Film Academy. The actress has won the Danish Academy Award for her supporting role in the mega-hit Den eneste ene (The One and Only, 1999). These nominations attest to Paprika Steen's strong performances given in a number of smaller, but memorable parts, for example as an upper-class snob in Les idiots (1998) (The Idiots), a touchingly nerdy beautician in The One and Only (1999) (The Only One) and as a strong, slightly neurotic sister in the mega-hit, The Celebration (1998) (The Celebration). Steen's considerable dramatic talent and potential is reinforced by a strong sense of humor that shines through in her work. While audiences may laugh hard, Steen remains sympathetic to the characters she portrays. The web of intertwined character flaws and potential is revealed with a light touch. It is the empathy that she evokes for her characters that makes her work memorable.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTMwMTEzNjY3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg4NzA4Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0824785","name":"Paprika Steen","idIMDB":"nm0824785"},"actorId":"nm0824785","character":"Sarah Svendsen","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ali Kazim","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443671","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzg1NzEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYxOTIzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 April 1973","placeOfBirth":" Nørrebro, Denmark","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Ali Kazim was born on April 26, 1973 in Nørrebro, Denmark.

While other actors strive to close in on life, Kaas - who experienced tragic loss at an early age - seems eager to escape the eye of the storm. It is a disturbing quality that etches his characters in the audience's mind. Kaas graduated from the National Theater School in Denmark in 1998. He first appeared on screen in Søren Kragh-Jacobsen's film _Drengene Fra Sankt Petri (1991)_ (The Boys from Sct. Petri) in 1991 as Otto, the rebel son of a traitor. The development of the character illustrates the growth of moral resistance into full-fledged violent revolt. This somber and masterfully-acted part earned Kaas two Danish film prizes, a Robert and a Bodil. Today Kaas imbues his adult characters with the unsentimental innocence and vulnerability of a child and audiences respond intuitively. Jeppe in 'Lars Von Trier''s _Idiots, The (1998)_ takes on true love, only to lose it. The actor received another Bodil for this portrayal. Kaas makes a narrow escape from type-casting by adding original qualities to the individual characters. He has also done self-parody as a happy-go-easy cook, working for a mafia-like boss in the midst of a murderous streak in In China They Eat Dogs (1999) (In China they eat dogs) and as a helpless man in the throes of love in Flickering Lights (2000) (Blinking lights). After imbuing smaller parts with larger-than-life performances, Kaas landed another main part in _Rigtigt menneske, Et (2001)_ (Truly human, 2001) as Ahmed, the aborted son (!) of a working couple. His would-be little sister is the emotionally neglected Lisa. When she dies, Ahmed comes to life and tries to become a real human being. Kaas delivers another masterful performance in this movie, inspired by the tragic tale of Casper Hauser.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMjcxODQ4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM4MDkyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0509263","name":"Nikolaj Lie Kaas","idIMDB":"nm0509263"},"actorId":"nm0509263","character":"Holger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gyrd Løfquist","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0530612","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 June 1921","placeOfBirth":" Copenhagen, Denmark","bio":"Gyrd Løfquist was born on June 2, 1921 in Copenhagen, Denmark.
