He made his film debut in Man Afraid (1957) and in 1959 signed as a contract player with Warner Bros., which promoted him to stardom with A Summer Place (1959) that year. He was soon a teenage heartthrob, his blond hair and blue eyes appearing frequently on the covers of movie magazines. His most successful film was Parrish (1961), in which he played the title character. A few years after that his career went into a decline; he made only a few television movies between the mid-'60s and his small role in The Godfather: Part II (1974) (in which his character's name, Merle Johnson, was actually his real name). His later films were almost entirely for the low-budget home video market, e.g., Sexpot (1990) and Nudity Required (1990).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MTk2ODE5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAwMDM2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001148","name":"Troy Donahue","idIMDB":"nm0001148"},"actorId":"nm0001148","character":"Uncle Gary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Johnny Venocur","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0893196","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"Johnny Venokur","bio":"Johnny Venocur was born as Johnny Venokur.
