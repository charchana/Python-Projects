A good student, Ving entered the New York High School of Performing Arts, where he discovered his love of acting. He studied at the Juilliard School of Drama, and began his career in New York theater and in Shakespeare in the Park productions. He first appeared on Broadway in the play \"The Winter Boys\", in 1984. Also that year, he appeared in front of the cameras for the first time in the TV movie American Playhouse: Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), and was then quickly cast in minor roles in several popular TV shows, including Miami Vice (1984), Tour of Duty (1987) and Crime Story (1986). Ving continued his rise to fame through his work in soap operas. His big break came in 1994 when director Quentin Tarantino cast him as the merciless drug dealer Marsellus Wallace in the mega hit Pulp Fiction (1994). Not long after, director Brian De Palma cast Rhames alongside Tom Cruise as the ace computer hacker, Luther Stickell in Mission: Impossible (1996). With solid performances in both these highly popular productions, his face was now well known to movie goers, and the work offers began rolling in more frequently. The next career highlight was playing the lead role in the HBO production of Don King: Only in America (1997). Rhames' performance as the world's most infamous boxing promoter was nothing short of brilliant, and at the 1998 Golden Globe Awards he picked up the award for Best Actor in a MiniSeries. However, in an incredible display of compassion, he handed over the award to fellow nominee Jack Lemmon, as he felt Lemmon was a more deserving winner! The talented actor then contributed attention grabbing performances in Bringing Out the Dead (1999), returned as Luther Stickell in Mission: Impossible II (2000), contributed his deep bass voice for the character of Cobra Bubbles in Lilo & Stitch (2002), and played a burly cop fighting cannibal zombie hordes in Dawn of the Dead (2004). A keen fitness & weight lifting enthusiast, Rhames is also well known for his strong spiritual beliefs and benevolent attitude towards other people. In a remarkable turn of events, whilst filming The Saint of Fort Washington (1993) in New York, he was introduced to a homeless man, who turned out to be his long lost, older brother, Junior, who had lost contact with the family after serving in Vietnam. The thrilled Rhames immediately assisted his disheveled brother in getting proper food & clothing, and moving him into his own apartment.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMTgyMzc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjE5Mjk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000609","name":"Ving Rhames","idIMDB":"nm0000609"},"actorId":"nm0000609","character":"Cobra Bubbles","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0028055","main":true},{"actorName":"Zoe Caldwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0129807","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1ODc5NDg3ODVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA1MjQ0MTc@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 September 1933","placeOfBirth":" Melbourne, Australia","bio":"As a testament to her remarkable talent, Broadway has honored esteemed stage actress Zoe Caldwell four times with Tony Awards: for \"Slapstick Tragedy\" (1966), for her title role in \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" (1968), for her searing performance as \"Medea\" (1982), and as opera diva Maria Callas in \"Master Class\" (1995). The Australian-born actress began her professional career at the tender age of 9 in a production of \"Peter Pan\" and went on to find radio work in her teens. Her parents provided her with the necessary foundation long ago with lessons in dance, elocution and music. She left school at age 15 and made her living teaching speech and performing on a children's radio program. Years of repertory work accumulated a formidable resume. She was one of the original members of Melbourne's Union Theatre Repertory Company (1954-1957) and appeared for two seasons with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in productions of \"Pericles\" and \"Much Ado About Nothing.\" She also toured Russia with the latter company in \"Hamlet,\" \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Romeo and Juliet.\" In 1963 she helped launch the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre. Broadway finally opened its curtains for her in 1965 when she briefly replaced Anne Bancroft in \"The Devils.\", and has since continued her routine of standing ovations with extraordinary performances as Eve in \"The Creation of the World and Other Business\" (1972: produced by the renown Robert Whitehead, her husband from 1968) and as Lillian Hellman in \"Lillian\" (1986). To the dismay of film audiences, Ms. Caldwell has managed to avoid the silver screen, appearing briefly in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) and scoring a larger role in Birth (2004). She took her resounding stage triumph \"Medea\" to TV and also performed magnificently as Lady Macbeth and Sarah Bernhardt on the small screen. As a now-prestigious stage director, she made her Broadway bow in 1977 with \"An Almost Perfect Person,\" and later helmed productions of \"Richard II,\" \"Othello,\" \"Macbeth\" and, more recently, \"Vita and Virginia\" starring Eileen Atkins and Vanessa Redgrave. She and husband Whitehead have maintained a long and successful private and professional partnership, first working together on \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" and later with \"Medea.\" Their son, Charles Whitehead, was the producer of \"The Play What I Wrote\" which briefly featured Ms. Caldwell in New York in 2003.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1ODc5NDg3ODVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA1MjQ0MTc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0129807","name":"Zoe Caldwell","idIMDB":"nm0129807"},"actorId":"nm0129807","character":"Grand Councilwoman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0012235","main":true},{"actorName":"Jason Scott Lee","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001462","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNzMwNTcwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTcyNTc3._V1_UY44_CR24,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 November 1966","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Of Hawaiian and Chinese descent, Jason Scott Lee was born in Los Angeles, California, but raised in Hawaii from the age of two.
