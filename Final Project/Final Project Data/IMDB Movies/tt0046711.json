As a youth she was noted for her prowess as a gymnast, a fact which contributed to her discovery for the screen by the director Pietro Francisci in 1952. Possessed of luminous eyes and a spirited personality, Leonora was rarely cast as anything other than eye-candy in spaghetti westerns or sword-and-sandal epics. A couple of exceptions stand out: first, her titular role as Balkis, The Queen of Sheba (1952) (co-starring Gino Cervi, as King Solomon); secondly, -- arguably her best performance -- as Sandra Rubini, wife of an irresponsible ne'er-do-well and inveterate womanizer (played by Franco Fabrizi) in Federico Fellini's masterpiece I Vitelloni (1953). She also romped through a couple of mildly diverting horror flics. As Gordon Scott's girlfriend she battled faceless robots and vampires in Goliath and the Vampires (1961). In the off-beat Mario Bava offering Hercules in the Haunted World (1961), she was held on the island of the Hesperides under the control of a demon (Christopher Lee at his menacing best). Leonora's sporadic career as a movie actress was done and dusted by 1961 and she retired from acting at the end of the decade.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMDg5MzQ0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkzODEwMzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0749333","name":"Leonora Ruffo","idIMDB":"nm0749333"},"actorId":"nm0749333","character":"Elena","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Paola Borboni","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095979","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 January 1900","placeOfBirth":" Golese di Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italy","bio":"Paola Borboni was born on January 1, 1900 in Golese di Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italy.

He, along with peers Vittorio Gassman, Ugo Tognazzi and Nino Manfredi, arguably represent the finest of post-war Italian cinema history. Born in Rome on June 15, 1920 in the Trastevere district, Sordi grew up in a musical family, his father being a tuba player for the Rome Opera House. A choir boy at the Sistine Chapel, he later trained for the theater in Milan but returned to Rome to work in radio and musical halls in comedy shows. In the late 30s he found his way into film as an extra. His first important role was in The Three Pilots (1942), a fascist war picture, but he wouldn't hit international stardom until a decade later when he starred in Federico Fellini's early films The White Sheik (1952) and I Vitelloni (1953). The titles of some of his most prolific characters were as simple as their titles: The Seducer, The Bachelor, The Husband, The Widower, The Traffic Cop, and The Moralist. Most of his protagonists amusingly, but not always pleasantly, stereotyped the worst attributes of Italian men and society, yet many of his films are unparalleled in quality and considered masterpieces. Sordi went on to star, direct and co-write more than 150 films. Never married and rather an introvert, he enjoyed a quiet, reclusive personal life. On his 80th birthday, he was made Mayor of Rome for the day. In 2002, after 190 films, he announced his retirement, and died of a heart attack the following year at age 82.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjA5ODUyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU1OTc0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0814773","name":"Alberto Sordi","nicknames":["Albertone"],"idIMDB":"nm0814773"},"actorId":"nm0814773","character":"Alberto","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Giuseppe Porelli","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0691728","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 November 1897","placeOfBirth":" Naples, Campania, Italy","birthName":"Giuseppe Porcelli","bio":"Giuseppe Porelli was born on November 24, 1897 in Naples, Campania, Italy as Giuseppe Porcelli.
