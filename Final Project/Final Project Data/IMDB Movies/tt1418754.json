A leading man with both strong dramatic range and ample comic timing, Lachy Hulme broke into movies by writing Canadian action/drama Men with Guns (1997), a bloody tale of friendship and revenge directed by Kari Skogland. Following numerous guest appearances on Australian television and many \"fringe\" theatre productions, he starred as \"Carl\" in the little-seen thriller Four Jacks (2001), a perfect role that combined his natural intensity with a dark, violent streak. He won the Best Actor Award at the 2001 Melbourne Underground Film Festival as a result. Known for being very private, he does interviews when promoting a movie, but he never discusses his relationships or family. After Four Jacks, he re-teamed with writer/director Matthew George for a change of pace, the light-hearted adventure Let's Get Skase (2001), starring as real-life sleazebag turned kidnapper \"Peter Dellasandro\". Based on a true story, the film was attacked by Australian critics for being in \"bad taste\" at the time of its release. Hulme fought valiantly for the film, often attacking its critics in television and radio interviews, and the controversy boosted his profile considerably. He soon landed roles opposite Steve Irwin in Traqueur de croco en mission périlleuse (2002) and in the video game _Enter the Matrix (2003)_.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0MDA5OTk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY4NTYzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0401522","name":"Lachy Hulme","idIMDB":"nm0401522"},"actorId":"nm0401522","character":"Ken Rutherford","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ditch Davey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1004206","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGIzZmY4MzktYWUwYy00ZWUwLTk0YzMtNWRjZDg5YTQ3N2VjL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ2ODg1NjU@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1972","placeOfBirth":" Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","birthName":"Kristian Davey","bio":"Ditch Davey was born on April 12, 1972 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia as Kristian Davey.

Influenced by many prominent actors from Sir. Anthony Hopkins to Jim Carey, he decided to study dramatic arts and regularly perform in local musicals in his formative college years. Paul earned himself a strong reputation for leading these productions in roles such as 'Pharaoh' in Joseph & The Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, and 'Coach Bolton' in Disney's High School Musical On Stage. Beyond college, Paul was coached and mentored by Logie award winner Paul O'Brien (Home and Away 2005-2009) as a way to further his knowledge of the acting craft. Paul also began working and filming scenes with Director Kelly Dolen (John Doe 2012) and was mentored by Producer Robert Galinsky (Dust And Glory 2012). In 2010 Paul became the State Champion and National Runner Up in Martial Arts (NAS). This strong physical foundation has seen his performance credentials bolstered as an 'action actor'. In turn this has allowed Paul to be cast as a leading man in many productions. Paul's long history of acting, public speaking and performing has enabled him to deal confidently with the media. He has been flown to the World Jamboree in England as a national ambassador of Australia; Selected as the Master Of Ceremonies for National Founders Day at Parliament House (in front of 16,000 members of the public) for Scouting's 100th Anniversary National Celebrations; and presented on radio stations including Nova & Vega FM during prime time with Hughesy and Kate & Shaun Micallef, Denise Scott and Dave O'Neil. Strong leadership abilities are another of his skills, resulting in popularity and respect from his peers. In 2008, Paul was voted College Captain in his final year. He was also presented the Queen's Scout Award by Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth's Representative at Victorian Government House. In 2011, Paul successfully auditioned for the role of the Best Friend and Key Ninja in a widely popular RACV commercial. He gained further prominence when playing the role of an accountant in the Victorian Government TVC 'Find An Advisor.' Paul followed this up with a number of short productions before being cast as Dennis Rellik in the multi million dollar thriller 'John Doe' (2012). Paul's love of the acting craft shows in his work ethic and motivation to succeed. He looks forward to a continued bright future in the industry.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMDY5Mzc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQxODMyODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5059164","name":"Paul Allica","idIMDB":"nm5059164"},"actorId":"nm5059164","character":"Dennis Rellik","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ben Schumann","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1763861","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Ben Schumann is an actor, known for Holly's Heroes (2005), Webster Say (2005) and Fast Lane (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1763861","name":"Ben Schumann","idIMDB":"nm1763861"},"actorId":"nm1763861","character":"Boy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Brian Wenzel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0921171","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 May 1929","placeOfBirth":" Adelaide, South Australia, Australia","birthName":"Brian Thomas Wenzel","bio":"Brian Wenzel was born on May 24, 1929 in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia as Brian Thomas Wenzel.
