In 1967 he returned to Italy to play the lead in God Forgives... I Don't! (1967). While on location in Almeria, Spain, he married an American girl of Bavarian descent, Lori Zwicklbauer, who was the dialogue coach for the picture. The producers of this movie wanted him to change his name. He then got a list with 20 names on it and 24 hours time to choose one of these names. He decided to take Terence Hill cause he liked it the most and it has the same initials as his mother's name (Hildegard Thieme). They only told the public that \"Hill\" was his wife's name out of publicity reasons. At this time of upcoming feminism a man who took his wife's name was something special. In 1976 Hollywood called and he appeared in March or Die (1977) with Gene Hackman and starred in Mr. Billion (1977) with Valerie Perrine. Since then he has concentrated on action/adventure films starring himself and often working with long time partner Bud Spencer.

His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield's famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in \"Harvey\". In 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson in From Here to Eternity (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as \"heavies\" in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty Piletti, a shy and sensitive butcher, in Marty (1955). He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, despite strong competition from Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, James Dean and James Cagney. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Borgnine performed memorably in such films as The Catered Affair (1956), Ice Station Zebra (1968) and Emperor of the North (1973). Between 1962 and 1966, he played Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the popular television series McHale's Navy (1962). In early 1984, he returned to television as Dominic Santini in the action series Supercopter (1984) co-starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and in 1995, he was cast in the comedy series The Single Guy (1995) as doorman Manny Cordoba. He also appeared in several made-for-TV movies. Ernest Borgnine has often stated that acting is his greatest passion, and he is still working today. His amazing 61-year career (1951 - 2012 and continuing) includes appearances in well over 100 feature films and as a regular in three television series, as well as voiceovers in animated films such as All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 (1996), Small Soldiers (1998), and a continued role in the series SpongeBob SquarePants (1999). Between 1973 until his death, Ernest was married to Tova Traesnaes, who heads her own cosmetics company. They lived in Beverly Hills, California, where Ernest assisted his wife between film projects. When not acting, Ernest actively supported numerous charities and spoke tirelessly at benefits throughout the country. He has been awarded several honorary doctorates from colleges across the United States as well as numerous Lifetime Achievement Awards. In 1996, Ernest purchased a bus and traveled across the United States to see the country and meet his many fans. On December 17, 1999, he presented the University of North Alabama with a collection of scripts from his film and television career, due to his long friendship with North Alabama alumnus and actor George Lindsey (died May 6, 2012), who was an artist in residence at North Alabama. Ernest Borgnine passed away aged 95 on July 8, 2012, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, of renal failure. He is survived by his wife Tova, their children and his younger sister Evelyn (1926-2013)","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDE1NjY2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDE0MzM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000308","name":"Ernest Borgnine","nicknames":["Ernie"],"idIMDB":"nm0000308"},"actorId":"nm0000308","character":"Sgt.

In New York she worked as a model and was cast by Al Jolson as one of the showgirls in his Broadway play \"Hold Onto Your Hats.\" When the show closed in 1941, she married popular singer Dick Haymes and went with him to Hollywood. Discovered by a talent scout while working in the theater, Joanne made her screen debut in Abie's Irish Rose (1946), and that picture almost ended her career. Two years later she \"redeemed\" herself with her role in the classic Howard Hawks western Red River (1948). She followed that with another western, John Ford's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), again playing opposite John Wayne. Unfortunately, her success in those two classics resulted in the scripts being submitted to her consisting of mostly westerns, and she got typecast (this from a woman who said, \"I simply hated horses...\"). In 1950 she was cast in another John Ford western, Wagon Master (1950), which became the basis for the Ward Bond TV series Wagon Train (1957). Even though she played in films other than westerns--All the King's Men (1949), The Pride of St. Louis (1952) and Hell on Frisco Bay (1955), for example--it was the westerns for which she was remembered. By the late 1950s westerns were running out of steam and so was her screen career, so she turned to TV, where she appeared on shows such as Playhouse 90 (1956). In 1960 Joanne was cast in the role of the Eastern owner of a dude ranch in the comedy series Guestward Ho! (1960). Perhaps even funnier is that she would play an Easterner after all those westerns is the fact that her character name was Babs. The show ended in 1961.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTcxMjc1MDM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzNzU2NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0238445","name":"Joanne Dru","nicknames":["Joanne Marshall"],"idIMDB":"nm0238445"},"actorId":"nm0238445","character":"Rosy Labouche","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Marc Lawrence","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492908","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzM5ODQ4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE4ODExOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1910","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Max Goldsmith","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"American character actor who specialized in underworld types, despite a far greater range. A native of the Bronx, Lawrence participated in plays in school, then attended the City College of New York. In 1930, he was accepted into Eva Le Gallienne's company, where he became friendly with another young actor, one day to be known as John Garfield. The two appeared in a number of plays, both with Le Galliene's company and with the highly-politicized Group Theatre, before Lawrence was given a film contract with Columbia Pictures. His scarred complexion and brooding appearance made him a natural for heavies, and he played scores of gangsters and mob bosses over the next six decades. Nevertheless, he could turn in fine performances in very different kinds of roles as well, such as his bewildered mountain boy in The Shepherd of the Hills (1941). Following the Second World War, as anti-Communist fervor gripped America, Lawrence found himself under scrutiny for his political leanings. When called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he admitted he had once been a member of the Communist Party. The Committee broke down his resolve and he named the names of other Party members. He was blacklisted and departed for Europe, where he continued to make films, often in leading roles. Following the demise of the blacklist, he returned to America and resumed his position as a familiar and talented purveyor of gangland types. A writer and director as well, Lawrence has remained active in his ninth decade.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzM5ODQ4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE4ODExOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0492908","name":"Marc Lawrence","idIMDB":"nm0492908"},"actorId":"nm0492908","character":"Torpedo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Julie Gordon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330353","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Julie Gordon is an actress, known for Super Fuzz (1980), If Ever I See You Again (1978) and Blood Rage (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330353","name":"Julie Gordon","idIMDB":"nm0330353"},"actorId":"nm0330353","character":"Evelyn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lee Sandman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0762021","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Lee Sandman is an actor, known for Lenny (1974), Super Fuzz (1980) and The Mean Season (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0762021","name":"Lee Sandman","idIMDB":"nm0762021"},"actorId":"nm0762021","character":"McEnroy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Salvatore Borghese","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0096613","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 March 1937","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","birthName":"Salvatore Borgese","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Salvatore Borghese was born on March 5, 1937 in Rome, Lazio, Italy as Salvatore Borgese.
