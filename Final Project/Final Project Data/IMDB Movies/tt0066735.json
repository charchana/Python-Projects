Her first billed film was a featured part in Spencer's Mountain (1963), starring Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara and James MacArthur. After her first acting role, Mimsy took acting lessons after graduation and landed a few more roles, playing featured characters in the films, Bus Riley's Back in Town (1965), Hot Rods to Hell (1967), Riot on Sunset Strip (1967) and Devil's Angels (1967). After spending a year in Canada and working in a research hospital, she returned to the USA, moved to Los Angeles, and was soon cast for a role in Roger Corman's The Wild Racers (1968), which was directed by Daniel Haller. Her experience on that film was to her 'a pleasant one' because she first traveled to Europe and experienced the various countries, and to England to visit her older brother, who worked as a math teacher at a university in London. After appearing in the film, More (1969), Mimsy traveled to Italy for a vacation and met her future husband, screenwriter Vincenzo Cerami, who wanted to write her a part in a film. He was later fired as the scriptwriter and her role was not cast. After spending time in Italy, and disillusioned by the civil unrest and political problems with the USA and its involvement in the Vietnam War, Mimsy, a liberal left-winger, settled in Italy to continue her acting career there. Mimsy Farmer first became an international star when Dario Argento cast her to appear alongside Michael Brandon in 'giallo' mystery-thriller, 4 mouches de velours gris (1971) (aka \"Four Flies on Grey Velvet\"), in 1971. After her success with \"Four Flies on Grey Velvet\" (1971), Mimsy remained in Italy and a steady stream of acting roles followed with dramatic parts in dramas and thrillers, including Allonsanfan (1974), and Le Parfum de la Dame en Noir (1974), directed by Francesco Barilli. One of her best roles was a starring role in the horror-mystery-thriller, Autopsy (1975) (aka \"Autopsy\"), directed by Armando Crispino, where she played a pathologist investigating a murder. She also appeared in two films, directed by Ruggero Deodato, titled SOS Concorde (1979) and Body Count (1986). Lucio Fulci even cast her, in 1981, for a co-starring part in The Black Cat (1981) (aka \"The Black Cat\") (1981), playing the heroine/victim. She also appeared in a number of French language films and TV. After her divorce from Vincenzo Cerami in the 1980s, Mimsy and her teenage daughter, Aisha Cerami, settled in France, where she also did some French-language movie and TV roles and she considers French an easier language to learn and speak than Italian.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5MTY4MTMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTcxODMyNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002069","name":"Mimsy Farmer","idIMDB":"nm0002069"},"actorId":"nm0002069","character":"Nina Tobias","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0547339","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTA0ODQ5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQyMDMxOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1932","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Jean-Pierre Marielle was born on April 12, 1932 in Paris, France.

The first Italian to swim the 100-meter freestyle in less than a minute, Spencer competed as a swimmer on the Italian National Team at the Olympic Summer games in both Helsinki, Finland, in 1952 and Melbourne, Australia, in 1956. He was also an Olympic-class water polo player. Educated as an attorney, he was bitten by the acting bug and appeared as a member of the Praetorian Guard in his first movie, MGM's epic Quo Vadis (1951) (which was shot in Italy) in 1951. During the 1950s and first half of the 1960s he appeared in films made for the Italian market, but his career was strictly minor league until the late 1960s. He changed his screen name to \"Bud Spencer\" in 1967, as an homage to Spencer Tracy and to the American beer Budweiser. Spencer allegedly thought it was funny to call himself \"Bud\" in light of his huge frame. After the name change, Spencer achieved his greatest success in spaghetti Westerns lensed for a global audience. Teaming up with fellow Italian Terence Hill, the two made such international hits as Ace High (1968) and They Call Me Trinity (1970) (\"They Call Me Trinity\"). Their dual outings made both stars famous, particularly in Europe. In all, Spencer made 18 movies with Hill. He became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot after appearing in All the Way Boys (1972) and owned an air transportation company, Mistral Air, which he founded in 1984. However, he terminated his business interest in Mistral and entered the children's clothing industry. After 1983 Spencer's movie career slowed down, though he did have a big success in the early 1990s with the TV action-drama series \"Extralarge\". A man of many talents, Spencer wrote screenplays and texts for some of his movies. He also has registered several patents. Spencer married Maria Amato in 1960 and they have three children, Giuseppe (born 1961), Christine (1962) and Diamante (1972). In 2005 Spencer entered politics, standing as regional councillor in Lazio for the center-right Forza Italia party. He became a politician specifically at the bequest of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. According to Spencer, \"In my life, I've done everything. There are only three things I haven't been - a ballet dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are out of the question, I'll throw myself into politics.\" Berlusconi, who was a media tycoon in the vein of Rupert Murdoch before he entered politics, recruited Spencer as he was \"still a major draw for the viewer, alias the voter.\" Critics of Berlusconi--who tried to retain power by launching a campaign to portray his allies as the embodiment of \"good\" and the leftists of the opposition as \"evil\"--was derided as an example of \"politica spettacolo\" (\"showbiz politics\"). Spencer announced his new career at a \"Felliniesque\" press conference at a Rome hotel, at which he hardly moved and had little to say except homilies about upholding family values. Spencer sat between two Forza Italia handlers, and according to one major Italian newspaper, \"From one moment to the next, you expected this mountain of a man to grab the heads of the two presenters and smack them together in his usual style, as he has been seen doing countless times on the big screen and television.\" The audition proved to be a flop: Spencer lost the seat, and Berlusconi's party was swept from power in 2006.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMTkzNjI2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzY2NzEz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0817881","name":"Bud Spencer","nicknames":["Bud Spencer"],"idIMDB":"nm0817881"},"actorId":"nm0817881","character":"Diomede 'Dio'","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Aldo Bufi Landi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0119411","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 April 1923","placeOfBirth":" Naples, Italy","bio":"Aldo Bufi Landi was born on April 7, 1923 in Naples, Italy.
