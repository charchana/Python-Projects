He has since taken on the challenges of dozens of roles in film, television and on stage. In addition, he has written, directed and produced film and theatre. He also has had his fiction and poetry published. Stephen has had the good fortune to work with extraordinary talents throughout his career. He starred in a Feature film with Orson Welles, was featured with Woody Allen in a film and performed in many sketches with Johnny Carson as part of The Mighty Carson Art Players on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. One of his many other credits includes having starred in an Academy Award nominated film. Recently he has starred in films winning Festival awards and has broken into (or would it be \"out of\") the World-Wide Web. See him at JibJab.com and of course, on YouTube. The stage represents a very special place in Stephen's life and work and he has been in award-winning plays throughout his career. He recently had lead roles in four World Premier plays. He was a Founding Member of the Hit Comedy Improv Troupe, Cat Venom. And Stand-up Comedy was a challenge that he mastered following Johnny Carson's passing...in his honor. Of course, being cousin to Larry Fine - of The Three Stooges fame - carries its own obligations...but more on that some other time. While acting has been his love and focus for all these years, Stephen has also earned the title of \"Master Sifu\"- Teacher of Qigong/Internal Healing and Martial Arts. He also has been successful in another career as well, but if he told you what it was, he would have to kill you.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461087","name":"Stephen Knight","idIMDB":"nm0461087"},"actorId":"nm0461087","character":"Jason","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cassandra Gava","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0310430","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwODc4NTI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ4NjY5Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 April 1959","placeOfBirth":" San Francisco, California, USA","birthName":"Cassandra Gaviola","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Strikingly lovely, sultry and exotic Filipino-American brunette beauty Cassandra Gava was born as Cassandra Gaviola on April 28, 1959 in San Francisco, California.
