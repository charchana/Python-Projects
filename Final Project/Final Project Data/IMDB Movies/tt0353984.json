Born in Washington, D.C., Todd spent two years on a scholarship at the University of Connecticut, which, in turn, led to a scholarship from the renowned Eugene O'Neill National Theatre Institute. It proved to be the foundation for intense stints at the Hartman Conservatory in Stamford, Connecticut and the Trinity Square Repertory Theatre Conservatory in Providence, Rhode Island. Todd appeared in dozens of classical and many experimental plays, yet still managed to find time to teach playwriting to high school students in the Hartford public school system. Todd's extensive credits exemplify his versatility. They include such film classics as The Rock (1996), The Crow (1994), Lean on Me (1989), Bird (1988), Night of the Living Dead (1990), Destination finale (2000), the multiple Academy Award winning Oliver Stone film Platoon (1986) and Le secret (2000), which was nominated and screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Todd's recent films include the independent film Silence (2002) and Final Destination 2 (2003). He has had prominent guest starring roles in numerous critically-acclaimed television series, including recurring on Boston Public (2000), For the People (2002) and The District (2000), as well as NYPD Blue (1993), Smallville (2001), Law & Order (1990), Crossing Jordan (2001), Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) and The X-Files (1993). Todd recurred on three incarnations of \"Star Trek\" and guest starred on Xena: Warrior Princess (1995) and episodes of CSI: Miami (2002) and Andromeda (2000). His television movies include starring roles in True Women (1997), Black Fox (1995), Butter (1998), Ivory Hunters (1990), Babylon 5: A Call to Arms (1999) and Control Factor (2003). Todd's considerable theatre credits include the world premiere of award-winning playwright August Wilson's \"King Hedley II\", where he originated the title role in Pittsburgh, Seattle and Boston. Variety commented: \"Todd's King Hedley dominates the stage. A sour-faced mix of rage and resolve, anger and vulnerability. Todd's Hedley was a memorable tour-de-force even on opening.\" He also received a coveted Helen Hayes nomination for his performance in Athol Fugard's \"The Captain's Tiger at La Jolla, the Manhattan Theatre Club and the Kennedy Center. Other theatre credits include \"Les Blancs\", \"Playboy of the West Indies\", \"Othello\", \"Zooman and the Sign\", award-winning playwright Keith Glover's \"Dark Paradise\", \"Aida\" (on Broadway), and most recently, \"Levee James\" for the prestigious Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference and The New Dramatist Guild.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNTI1Njc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4NzcyNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865302","name":"Tony Todd","idIMDB":"nm0865302"},"actorId":"nm0865302","character":"Caleb Kilgore","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Nicole Kingston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1340763","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MDAzNTA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg0ODIzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Nicole Kingston is an actress, known for Scarecrow Slayer (2003), Live Fast, Die Young (2008) and Officer Down (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MDAzNTA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg0ODIzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1340763","name":"Nicole Kingston","idIMDB":"nm1340763"},"actorId":"nm1340763","character":"Mary Anderson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Castro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1253994","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 April 1979","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","bio":"David was born in Bryan-College Station, Texas to David and Rene Castro.

Douglas was born in Berkeley, California, but lived throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. With a family history that included the circus, vaudeville and burlesque, D.C. fell into theatre at an early age. After high school he moved to Los Angeles to study under Estelle Harman (former head of talent for Universal). During the late 80s and early 90s he performed with various Los Angeles theatre companies, including several years as a member of the critically acclaimed New One-Act Theatre Ensemble (Theatre of NOTE). His first break came in 1996, when he was cast in a guest role on the NBC pilot Boston Common (1996). Max Mutchnick and David Kohan so appreciated his \"where's Waldo\" look that he returned for 10 more episodes as the conservative and humorless student \"D.C.\" This led to a modest, yet steady stream of work. He remained a mostly anonymous character actor and voice over artist until 2008 when he was cast as the voice of Albert Wesker in Resident Evil 5 (2009) and Legion in Mass Effect 2 (2010). Adding to his visibility were a series of non-acting events; his public battle with Tea Party PAC Freedomworks on cable news, his subsequent viral videos (including \"Why #OccupyWllStreet? 4 Reasons\"), and, oddly, being credited by The Hollywood Reporter with the tweet that began the Brett Ratner Academy Awards controversy. As a voice over artist his commercial work spans over 20 years. Notable credits include Netflix's \"Tiger,\" McDonalds' \"Be The Sizzle\" campaign and Geico's \"Celebrity\" campaigns. In addition to his viral videos, D.C. Douglas wrote, produced, directed and edited numerous film shorts. The Crooked Eye (2009), starring Academy Award winner Linda Hunt, was recently released on iTunes. D.C. continues to act in film, television and video games. In addition, he often can be found as a guest of honor at anime and comic cons throughout the US.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2ODQzMTc1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY4Mzg3NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0235006","name":"D.C.
