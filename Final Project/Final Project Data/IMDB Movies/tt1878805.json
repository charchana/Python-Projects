While his habit for avoiding mainstream artificiality in favor of small, intense, independent vehicles is quite intact, in retrospect it looks as if he has purposely avoided glossy Hollywood stardom in search of quality work. Chaplin was born Benedict John Greenwood in Windsor, England, where he was raised, the youngest of four children of Cynthia (Chaplin), a drama teacher, and Peter Greenwood, a civil engineer. He first developed an interest in acting while appearing in a school play. He attended London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama, but did not conform well to the school's program layout and left after his first year to scout out the local theatre scene. A one-time statistician for the London Transport Authority during his fledgling years as a young actor, he made his TV debut in 1990. His first role of note occurred with a co-starring role in the TV-movie Bye Bye Baby (2001). This led to an introduction to film-making with a small part as a footman in the Merchant Ivory period drama The Remains of the Day (1993) starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. After a breakthrough playing a social misfit in the film Feast of July (1995) and a show-stopping, offbeat role in the BBC TV series Game On (1995), Hollywood quickly took notice and he was offered the role of the photographer who gets caught between two women in The Truth About Cats & Dogs (1996) co-starring Uma Thurman and Janeane Garofalo. Just as in acting school, he was unwilling to conform to the Hollywood system and immediately sought out work on the London stage. Following theatre roles in \"The Neighbour\" (1993) and \"Peaches\" (1994), he earned winning reviews and an Olivier Award nomination for his compelling portrayal of Tom Wingfield opposite theatre legend Zoë Wanamaker in \"The Glass Menagerie\" on the London stage. Quite in demand by this time for films he appeared alongside Jennifer Jason Leigh and Albert Finney in Washington Square (1997), Agnieszka Holland version of the Henry James novel that had previously appeared on screen as The Heiress (1949) starring Montgomery Clift and winning Olivia de Havilland the Academy Award for Best Actress of 1949. This period piece failed achieve its predecessor's financial success or critical praise, but Ben did receive kudos for his touching performance in the role of Private Bell in Terrence Malick much-admired remake of The Thin Red Line (1998). Since then Ben has concentrated on risk-taking and quality rather than on mainstream filming. In the exorcist-themed Lost Souls (2000) he played an atheistic crime writer deemed to become Satan himself; played a modest bank clerk who tangles with a Russian mail-order bride (Nicole Kidman) in Birthday Girl (2001); portrayed Sandra Bullock's rookie partner in the crimer Murder by Numbers (2002); and melded beautifully into a number of period pieces such as Le talisman (2002), Stage Beauty (2004), The New World (2005) and Me and Orson Welles (2008). The dark-eyed, thick-browed, soulful-eyed actor also showed off his transatlantic appeal on stage after making his 2003 Broadway debut in \"The Retreat from Moscow\" and earning a Tony nomination in the process. Recent filming has included a prime role in yet another portrait of Dorian Gray (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Mzk2MDk3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzgwNDc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001035","name":"Ben Chaplin","idIMDB":"nm0001035"},"actorId":"nm0001035","character":" Sir Thomas Langley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0313837","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlotte Riley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2731660","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODk4NzUwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc1MDQ4Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 December 1981","placeOfBirth":" England, UK","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Charlotte Riley was born on December 29, 1981 in England.

She has one sister, eight years her senior. Her parents and sister are not involved in the performing arts. At an early age she performed in school plays, having shown a talent and desire to \"turn herself into\" other people. She has referred to it as \"an emotional fusion; you think yourself into them\". This mimicry could be of school friends or film stars. She left school (Southport High School for Girls) at the age of 17, and originally intended becoming a vet. She also considered studying English literature in college, but decided to concentrate on drama and enrolled at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (as did many well-known British actors). After three years she graduated and moved into repertory theatre. She became affiliated with the Library Theatre in Manchester in 1979, where she became an assistant stage manager. She obtained her Equity card, and after several regional productions, first appeared on the London stage (Moving at Queens Theatre) in 1981. British television roles soon followed, and then film. Since then, Miranda has moved into the international arena, and has made films in America, France and Spain. Television work (on both sides of the Atlantic) continues, as does some stage work. Her roles are diverse, but powerful and engaging. She has been quoted as stating \"what I basically like is doing things I haven't done before\" and this continually comes through in the variety of roles she has played in her career. She is also selective in the roles she takes, being uninterested in performing in the standard Hollywood fare, and preferring more offbeat roles. She was approached to play the Glenn Close role in Fatal Attraction (1987), but found it \"regressive in its attitudes\". Her attitude is summed up by a quote from an interview that appeared in the New York Times (Dec 27 1992): \"I would rather do many small roles on TV, stage or film than one blockbuster that made me rich but had no acting. And if that's the choice I have to make, I think I've already made it\". According to \"1994 Current Biography Yearbook\", she resides in South London with her two Siamese cats, Otis and Waldo. She has now moved to West London. Her hobbies include drawing, walking, gardening, fashion, falconry, and music. She, by her own admission, is a loner and lives rather modestly. An actor who studied with Ms Richardson at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre in the late 1970s described her as \"a strong minded, specially gifted, rather pretty young woman who enjoys wearing jewelry. She wore toe rings, which in the late 1970s and especially in England, were a rarity and considered rather racy.\" He also remarked on her drive, even then, to be an actress of the highest caliber.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NzM2ODE5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAyMDc0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001669","name":"Miranda Richardson","idIMDB":"nm0001669"},"actorId":"nm0001669","character":" Mother Cecilia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Peter Firth","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278752","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNjE1NTk4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkxNDI0._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 October 1953","placeOfBirth":" Bradford, Yorkshire, England, UK","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Peter Firth was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, in 1953.

Leaving school at 16, he became a major child star in television series such as The Double Deckers, which was shot at a number of film studios in the UK. He made his film debut at the age of 18 in Franco Zeffirelli's Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972). In July 1973 he received his big break by winning the leading role of disturbed adolescent Alan Strang in Peter Shaffer's play \"Equus,\" which was performed by the National Theatre at the Old Vic in London. In October 1974, the play opened on Broadway to sensational reviews, with Firth playing opposite Anthony Hopkins as the middle-aged Dr. Martin Dysart. Firth returned to the play at the Plymouth Theater on Broadway with Richard Burton as Dysart, and then starred in several other plays by the National Theatre including versions of \"Romeo and Juliet\" (as Romeo) and \"Spring Awakening.\" After taking leading roles in several films such as Aces High (1976) and Joseph Andrews (1977), Firth reprized the role of Alan Starng in the movie version of Equus (1977), directed by Sidney Lumet and again co-starring with Burton. Receiving a Bafta Award and an Academy Award nomination, Firth next played Angel Clare in Roman Polanski's Tess (1979). In 1981, he replaced Simon Callow as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Peter Shaffer's play \"Amadeus\" on Broadway, co-starring with Sir Ian McKellen. He gave other notable performances as a Russian sailor in the kitchen sink drama Letter to Brezhnev (1985), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Shadowlands (1993) and as a sinister theater manager in An Awfully Big Adventure (1995) with Hugh Grant. In 1994, he returned to British television with a major role in the hugely popular series Heartbeat (1992). He is married with four children and is good friends with his Equus (1977) co-star Jenny Agutter, who also starred with him in MI-5 (2002). He has continued to appear in major movies, including Amistad (1997) and Pearl Harbor (2001).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNjE1NTk4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkxNDI0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278752","name":"Peter Firth","idIMDB":"nm0278752"},"actorId":"nm0278752","character":" Earl Roland","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0313842","main":true},{"actorName":"Sarah Gadon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0300589","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MzA0MDg0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA5ODQ0OTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 April 1987","placeOfBirth":" Toronto, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Sarah Gadon","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Sarah Gadon was born in a quiet residential area in Toronto, Ontario, to a teacher mother and a psychologist father.
