Dillon displayed his versatility with an arresting performance co-starring as a racist cop in the critically acclaimed Paul Haggis film Crash. This role earned him nominations for an Academy award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics Choice Award, BAFTA Award and won him an Independent Spirit Award. In addition, the film earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Critics Choice Award for Best Ensemble. As the New York Times' Film Critic A.O. Scott put it, \"He seems to be getting better with every film.\" He starred opposite Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson in Universal Pictures' comedy, You, Me and Dupree and in Factotum for which he received glowing reviews for portraying Charles Bukowski's alter ego when the film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. From his breakthrough performance in The Outsiders to his hilarious turn as an obsessed private investigator in There's Something About Mary, he has proven himself to be one of the most diverse actors of his generation. In 1990 Dillon won an IFP Spirit Award for his gritty performance as a drug addict in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy. From there he went on to star in such films as Ted Demme's Beautiful Girls opposite Uma Thurman and Natalie Portman, Cameron Crowe's Singles, In & Out with Kevin Kline, Kevin Spacey's Albino Alligator, Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish, Garry Marshall's Flamingo Kid, Van Sant's To Die For with Nicole Kidman, and John McNaughton's Wild Things. He starred in Nothing But The Truth, opposite Kate Beckinsale and Vera Farmiga, Disney's Old Dogs, opposite John Travolta, Robin Williams and Kelly Preston, and the Screen Gems films Armored and Takers. Aside from being an accomplished actor, Dillon wrote, and made his feature film directorial debut with City of Ghosts, in which he also starred with Gérard Depardieu, Stellan Skarsgård, and James Caan. Prior to City of Ghosts, Dillon made his television directorial debut in 1997 with an episode of HBO's gritty prison drama Oz. Dillon's achievements continued with television appearances in an HBO adaptation of Irwin Shaw's Return To Kansas City and a part co-narrating the documentary Dear America: Letters From Home. Dillon's multi-talents have also landed him on stage starring on Broadway in The Boys In Winter as well as the PBS/American Playhouse production of The Great American Fourth Of July And Other Disasters. His recent film credits include the comedy Girl Most Likely opposite Annette Bening and Kristen Wiig; the drama Sunlight, Jr. opposite Naomi Watts, and the heist comedy The Art Of The Steal opposite Kurt Russell. Dillon most recently starred in M. Night Shyamalan's hit television event series Wayward Pines for FOX.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk4NjI3NjQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE3NzI5NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000369","name":"Matt Dillon","idIMDB":"nm0000369"},"actorId":"nm0000369","character":"Jesse Weiland","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0339449","main":true},{"actorName":"Willem Dafoe","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000353","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNjU2MTYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY5MDY4NDE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 July 1955","placeOfBirth":" Appleton, Wisconsin, USA","birthName":"William J.

She has German, English, and Irish ancestry. Smart was a relatively new arrival when she first gained notice for her supporting roles in the 1999 hit teen films Varsity Blues (1999) and Outside Providence (1999). With her blonde, carefree California girl good looks, the Los Angeles native got her start in TV-movies and made her feature debut in Stephen Kay's The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997) screened at 1997's Sundance Film Festival alongside Keanu Reeves. She was briefly seen in Paul Verhoeven's big-budget sci-fi actioner Starship Troopers (1997) with actor Casper Van Dien and had an impressive turn in the vastly different, quirkily independent How to Make the Cruelest Month (1998). In the latter, she played Dot, the graceful golden girl who seduces the one-time boyfriend of her sister, the troubled protagonist Bell (Clea DuVall). The by-the-numbers horror film Campfire Tales (1997) followed in 1997, along with the topically chilling but clumsily executed internet stalker thriller, Dee Snider's Strangeland (1998), written, produced and starring the titular Twisted Sister frontman as a deranged torturer who meets his victims in web chatrooms. Amy reached her widest audience with a co-starring role opposite James Van Der Beek in Brian Robbins' surprise box office hit \"Varsity Blues (1999)\". The actress played Jules Harbor, a girl who longs for life beyond her small town's high school football-obsessed culture but who, as sister of the injured star quarterback (Paul Walker) and girlfriend of his idealistic replacement (Van Der Beek), is tied to it. Her next role was that of Shawn Hatosy's upper-class love interest in Michael Corrente's poignant 1970s era comedy \"Outside Providence (1999)\". Based on Peter Farrelly's novel, the film followed a working-class teenaged boy (Hatosy) sent by his abrasive but loving father (Alec Baldwin) to a tony prep school after running into trouble at home.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2Njc4NDA2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ1NDUwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005442","name":"Amy Smart","idIMDB":"nm0005442"},"actorId":"nm0005442","character":"Lynn Weiland","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0339448","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Marquette","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0549815","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMzgwMDg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcyNjk4OTE@._V1_UY44_CR14,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 October 1984","placeOfBirth":" Stuart, Florida, USA","height":"5' 7½\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Christopher Marquette was born in Stuart, Florida, on October 3, 1984. He began modeling at the age of four in Dallas, Texas. He landed his screen acting debut at the age of eight, starring as the son of Mira Sorvino in Sweet Nothing (1995). He played a lead in The Tic Code (1999) with the legendary Gregory Hines and on Broadway as Tiny Tim. His other big screen credits include Just Friends (2005), The Girl Next Door (2004) and Freddy vs. Jason (2003). On the Emmy-nominated and People's Choice Award-winning Joan of Arcadia (2003), Christopher brought romance. He starred as Adam Rove, the love interest for Joan (Amber Tamblyn). The romantic connection between Adam and Joan was enchanting. Christopher breathed life into Adam Rove's character--Adam was an artist, down to earth, vulnerable, loyal and honest. The touching and thunderous silences between Adam and Joan created and stirred the kind of romance every girl and many grown women long for, tossing Marquette's hat into the teen heartthrob arena. His small-screen credits include recurring roles on Showtime's Huff (2004) and Lifetime's Strong Medicine (2000). He guest-starred on ER (1994), 7th Heaven (1996), Judging Amy (1999) and Touched by an Angel (1994). Christopher starred in American Gun (2005), released at 2005 Toronto Film Festival. He stars with Justin Timberlake, Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis and rejoins Emile Hirsch in the Nick Cassavetes-directed Alpha Dog (2006), premiering at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. The story is inspired by the real-life story of Jesse James Hollywood, a drug dealer who became the youngest fugitive ever on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Christopher plays Keith Stratten, a member of Jesse's drug posse. He completed filming an independent film \"Graduation and The Invisible\" (Spyglass Entertainment). Christopher has been cast as the lead in Mindfire Entertainment's _Calvin Marshall (2007)_ in the lead role. Christopher is the oldest of the three Marquette brothers. They began their careers with a boost from their parents. Sean Marquette, the youngest, says his brother Christopher is his inspiration. Sean stars in 13 Going on 30 (2004) and has a recurring role in Still Standing (2002). The Marquettes enjoy helping each other for upcoming roles. The middle brother, Eric Marquette, starred on Desperate Housewives (2004), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000) and Malcolm in the Middle (2000). Acting is self-exploration for Christopher. He works at bringing his audience an original piece of work every time he performs. What makes Christopher different from other actors is his keen observation of people. Edward Norton, Peter Sarsgaard, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Daniel Day-Lewis have all influenced him. Christopher believes he is blessed with all of the opportunities within the entertainment industry. He donates his time to the Sunshine Foundation, the Cancer Society, Special Olympics and Pediatrics AIDS. Christopher lives with his family in Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMzgwMDg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcyNjk4OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0549815","name":"Chris Marquette","idIMDB":"nm0549815"},"actorId":"nm0549815","character":"Martin Fitch","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0339452","main":true},{"actorName":"Don Yesso","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0947742","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5OTYyNDE4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ4ODU3OTE@._V1_UY44_CR23,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 November 1954","placeOfBirth":" New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","bio":"Don Yesso was born on November 27, 1954 in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.
