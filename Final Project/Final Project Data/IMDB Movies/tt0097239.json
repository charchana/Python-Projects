Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!. Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols. Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including \"Easy Reader\", \"Mel Mounds\" and \"Count Dracula\" on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Driving Miss Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Glory (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade. His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991), and La puissance de l'ange (1992). Freeman's next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood's de-mythologized western Unforgiven (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment. More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Se7en (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Chain Reaction (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in Kiss the Girls (1997). Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Deep Impact (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute's black comedy Nurse Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Along Came a Spider (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama The Sum of All Fears (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired Dreamcatcher (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy The Big Bounce (2004). 2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman's on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy's judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy. Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Lucky Number Slevin (2006), a second go-round as God in Evan Almighty (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck's directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit The Bucket List (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, Wanted (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, The Dark Knight (2008). In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director's true-life drama Invictus (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor. Recently, Freeman appeared in RED (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan the Barbarian (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner's The Magic of Belle Isle (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Now You See Me (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MDMyMzI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM2OTk1MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151","name":"Morgan Freeman","idIMDB":"nm0000151"},"actorId":"nm0000151","character":"Hoke Colburn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014096","main":true},{"actorName":"Jessica Tandy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjUyODQzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5ODgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 June 1909","placeOfBirth":" Stoke Newington, London, England, UK","birthName":"Jessie Alice Tandy","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"A beloved, twinkly blue-eyed doyenne of stage and screen, actress Jessica Tandy's career spanned nearly six and a half decades. In that course of time, she enjoyed an amazing film renaissance at age 80, something unheard of in a town that worships youth and nubile beauty. She was born Jessie Alice Tandy in London in 1909, the daughter of Jessie Helen (Horspool), the head of a school for mentally handicapped children, and Harry Tandy, a traveling salesman. Her parents enrolled her as a teenager at the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where she showed immediate promise. She was 16 when she made her professional bow as Sara Manderson in the play \"The Manderson Girls\", and was subsequently invited to join the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Within a couple of years, Jessica was making a number of other debuts as well. Her first West End play was in \"The Rumour\" at the Court Theatre in 1929; her Gotham bow was in \"The Matriarch\" at the Longacre Theatre in 1930; and her initial film role was as a maid in The Indiscretions of Eve (1932). Jessica married British actor Jack Hawkins in 1932 after the couple had met performing in the play \"Autumn Crocus\" the year before. They had one daughter, Susan, before parting ways after eight years of marriage. An unconventional beauty with slightly stern-eyed and sharp, hawkish features, she was passed over for leading lady roles in films, thereby focusing strongly on a transatlantic stage career throughout the 1930s and 1940s. She grew in stature while enacting a succession of Shakespeare's premiere ladies (Titania, Viola, Ophelia, Cordelia). At the same time, she enjoyed personal successes elsewhere in such plays as \"French Without Tears\", \"Honour Thy Father\", \"Jupiter Laughs\", \"Anne of England\" and \"Portrait of a Madonna\". And then she gave life to Blanche DuBois. When Tennessee Williams' masterpiece \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" opened on Broadway on December 3, 1947, Jessica's name became forever associated with this entrancing Southern belle character. One of the most complex, beautifully drawn, and still sought-after femme parts of all time, she went on to win the coveted Tony award. Aside from introducing Marlon Brando to the general viewing public, \"Streetcar\" shot Jessica's marquee value up a thousandfold. But not in films. While her esteemed co-stars Brando, Kim Hunter and Karl Malden were given the luxury of recreating their roles in Elia Kazan's stark, black-and-white cinematic adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Jessica was devastatingly bypassed. Vivien Leigh, who played the role on stage in London and had already immortalized another coy, manipulative Southern belle on celluloid (Scarlett O'Hara), was a far more marketable film celebrity at the time and was signed on to play the delusional Blanche. To be fair, Leigh was nothing less than astounding in the role and went on to deservedly win the Academy Award (along with Malden and Hunter). Jessica would exact her revenge on Hollywood in later years. In 1942, she entered into a second marriage with actor/producer/director Hume Cronyn, a 52-year union that produced two children, Christopher and Tandy, the latter an actor in her own right. The couple not only enjoyed great solo success, they relished performing in each other's company. A few of their resounding theatre triumphs included the \"The Fourposter\" (1951), \"Triple Play\" (1959), \"Big Fish, Little Fish (1962), \"Hamlet\" (he played Polonius; she played Gertrude) (1963), \"The Three Sisters (1963) and \"A Delicate Balance.\" They supported together in films too, their first being The Seventh Cross (1944). In the film The Green Years (1946), Jessica, who was two years older than Cronyn, actually played his daughter! Throughout the 1950s, they built up a sturdy reputation as \"America's First Couple of the Theatre.\" In 1963, Jessica made an isolated film appearance in Alfred Hitchcock's classic The Birds (1963). Low on the pecking order at the time (pun intended), Hitchcock gave Jessica a noticeable secondary role and Jessica made the most of her brittle scenes as the high-strung, overbearing mother of Rod Taylor who witnesses horror along the California coast. It was not until the 1980s that Jessica (and Hume, to a lesser degree) experienced a mammoth comeback in Hollywood. Alongside Hume she delighted movie audiences in such enjoyable fare as Honky Tonk Freeway (1981), The World According to Garp (1982), Cocoon (1985) and *batteries not included (1987). In 1989, however, octogenarian Jessica was handed the senior citizen role of a lifetime as the prickly Southern Jewish widow who gradually forms a trusting bond with her black chauffeur in the genteel drama Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Jessica was presented with the Oscar, Golden Globe and British Film Awards, among others, for her exceptional work in the film that also won \"Best Picture\". Deemed Hollywood royalty now, she was handed the cream of the crop in elderly film parts and went on to win another Oscar nomination for Fried Green Tomatoes (1991) a couple of years later. Jessica also enjoyed some of her biggest stage hits (\"Streetcar\" notwithstanding) during her twilight years, earning two more Tony Awards for her exceptional work in \"The Gin Game\" (1977) and \"Foxfire\" (1982). Both co-starred her husband Hume and both were beautifully transferred by the couple to television. Diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1990, Jessica bravely continued working with Emmy-winning distinction on television. She died of her illness on September 11, 1994. Her last two films, Nobody's Fool (1994) and Camilla (1994), were released posthumously.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjUyODQzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5ODgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788","name":"Jessica Tandy","idIMDB":"nm0001788"},"actorId":"nm0001788","character":"Daisy Werthan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014097","main":true},{"actorName":"Dan Aykroyd","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000101","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI2MDA3NTg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM5ODgz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 July 1952","placeOfBirth":" Ottawa, Ontario, Canada","birthName":"Daniel Edward Aykroyd","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Daniel Edward Aykroyd was born on July 1, 1952 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to Lorraine Hélène (Gougeon), a secretary from a French-Canadian family, and Samuel Cuthbert Peter Hugh Aykroyd, a civil engineer who advised prime minister Pierre Trudeau.

Her parents, Orlando LuPone, a school administrator, and mother Angela, a librarian, eventually divorced. She was christened Patti in honor of her great-grand-aunt, the renowned 19th-century opera singer Adelina Patti. Trained in dance, her early days as a teen were spent as part of a 60s sibling group called \"The Lupone Trio,\" which was comprised of Patti and older twin brothers William and Robert LuPone, the latter moving on to a daunting career of his own. A graduate of Northport High School, she attended the Drama Division of The Juilliard School and became part of its first graduating class, which also included future stars Kevin Kline and David Ogden Stiers. In 1972 the legendary John Houseman reshaped said graduating class and formed The Acting Company, which earned a strong reputation on tour as a classical repertory group. Gaining invaluable acting experience, she stayed with the company until 1975. Making her NY theater debut in \"The School for Scandal\" (1972), she went on to play major roles in \"The Hostage,\" \"The Lower Depths,\" \"The Three Sisters\" (her Broadway debut), \"Measure for Measure,\" \"Scapin,\" \"Edward II,\" and \"The Time of Your Life,\" among others. However, it was in musicals that she would reign supreme. She played Lucy in a version of \"The Beggar's Opera\" (1973) and went on to earn distinction in \"The Robber Bridegroom\" (Tony nomination) (1975), \"The Baker's Wife\" (1976) and \"Working\" (1978). Her incredible pipes and assured countenance eventually earned her the role of a lifetime with \"Evita\" (1979). As Argentina's calculating and beloved Eva Peron, Patti grabbed the international spotlight with a rare dramatic fury and brilliance. Her electrifying performance earned her both the Tony and Drama Desk awards, and the resulting stardom officially launched her film and TV career. Minor roles in King of the Gypsies (1978) and 1941 (1979) led to a co-starring role with Tom Skerritt in the vigilante crimer Fighting Back (1982). Continuing to show off her singing prowess, she originated the role of Fantine in the London production of \"Les Misérables\" and became the first American to win the prestigious Olivier Award (for her work in both \"Les Miz\" and \"The Cradle Will Rock\") in 1985. She nabbed a second Drama Desk Award and another Tony nomination for her Reno Sweeney in \"Anything Goes\" (1987). Twice nominated for Emmy awards on TV, she impressed as Lady Bird opposite Randy Quaid's President Lyndon Baines Johnson in the mini-movie LBJ: The Early Years (1987) and scored a resounding hit on the dramatic series Life Goes On (1989) as Libby Thatcher, the loving, protective mother of a son (played by Chris Burke) afflicted with Down Syndrome. This groundbreaking program was the first of its kind to center its theme around a mentally handicapped character. The show ran a durable four seasons and its title song, \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La Da\" by Lennon/McCartney, featured Patti's vocals. A round of guest shots over the years have included \"Law & Order,\" \"Frazier,\" \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"Will & Grace\" (hilariously spoofing her diva image), and a recurring spot on the critically-acclaimed \"Oz.\" On film she was well represented by Witness (1985) and in Driving Miss Daisy (1989) as Dan Aykroyd's materialistic wife and minor nemesis to Jessica Tandy. The concert stage has been a commanding venue for Patti over the years with a number of successful one-woman singing showcases such as \"The Lady with the Torch,\" \"Matters of the Heart\" and \"Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,\" winning an Outer Critics Circle Award for her \"Patti Lupone on Broadway\" in 1995. Stage concert versions of \"Pal Joey,\" \"Passion,\" \"A Little Night Music,\" \"Can-Can\" and \"Candide\" have greatly added to her enduring popularity, in addition to her three solo evenings at Carnegie Hall. Powerhouse leads in \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1993) and \"Master Class\" (1996) have ensured her diva-like place as one of America's contemporary singing immortals. She earned another Tony nomination more recently for her inventive spin on the monstrous Mrs. Lovett in \"Sweeney Todd\" (2005). Married since 1988 to camera operator Matthew Johnston, they have one son, Josh, who appeared in a small role in Patti's concert version of \"Passion.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNDA4MTUwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTUyODA4ODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0526985","name":"Patti LuPone","idIMDB":"nm0526985"},"actorId":"nm0526985","character":"Florine Werthan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014100","main":true},{"actorName":"Esther Rolle","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0738354","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzMzc0NTQ3ODBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDQwNDEzNg@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 November 1920","placeOfBirth":" Pompano Beach, Florida, USA","birthName":"Esther Elizabeth Rolle","bio":"Best known for the role of Florida Evans on the 1970s sitcoms \"Maude\" and \"Good Times,\" African-American actress Esther Rolle proved to be as spirited and iron-willed off-camera as well. The gap-toothed actress with the gravelly voice was born in Pompano Beach, Florida, the 10th child of 18 born to Caribbean farming immigrants. Her first important work came with the Negro Ensemble Company and over the years would earn a solid careworn reputation in such theater plays as \"The Blacks,\" \"Blues for Mister Charlie,\" \"The Amen Corner,\" \"A Raisin in the Sun\" and \"A Member of the Wedding.\" Ironically, her father insisted she promise him that she would never becoming a servant or maid in real life. She didn't, and yet Esther would have her biggest successes playing just those types of roles. She caught the attention of TV producer Norman Lear while performing on stage who cast her in the \"Maude\" supporting role in 1972. Audiences loved her so much as the feisty domestic who stood her ground, and then some, against her volatile and liberal-minded employer Maude Findley (Bea Arthur), that Esther earned her own spinoff series with \"Good Times.\" Compelled to fight racial stereotypes, she insisted before accepting the series that a strong father figure be central in the show (actor John Amos). And while she still played the role of a lower middle-class maid, the show's emphasis was to be on her home and family life, not her outside work. Still, Esther left the show for one season when she was unhappy about the negative role model perpetuated by Jimmie Walker's jive-talking J.J. character, but later returned after the producers assured her that more responsibility would be taken. In other assignments, she won an Emmy Award for the TV movie \"Summer of My German Soldier\" and gained further respect for her work in Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" (1979) and for her film work in Driving Miss Daisy (1990) and Rosewood (1997). Two of her sisters, Estelle Evans and Rosanna Carter, were also character actresses. Afflicted with diabetes, Esther's health failed in the 1990s and toward the end of her life she was on kidney dialysis. The actress, who was divorced and had no children, died nine days after her 78th birthday on November 17, 1998.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzMzc0NTQ3ODBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDQwNDEzNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0738354","name":"Esther Rolle","idIMDB":"nm0738354"},"actorId":"nm0738354","character":"Idella","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0014099","main":true},{"actorName":"Joann Havrilla","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369908","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxMDExNzAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA4MTc2Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Joann Havrilla is an actress, known for Driving Miss Daisy (1989), Hairspray (1988) and Sara Goes to Lunch (2004).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxMDExNzAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA4MTc2Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369908","name":"Joann Havrilla","idIMDB":"nm0369908"},"actorId":"nm0369908","character":"Miss McClatchey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0258516","main":true},{"actorName":"William Hall Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355253","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"William Hall Jr. is an actor, known for Driving Miss Daisy (1989), Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) and Boy Culture (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355253","name":"William Hall Jr.","idIMDB":"nm0355253"},"actorId":"nm0355253","character":"Oscar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0258555","main":true},{"actorName":"Alvin M.
