In the 1920s he switched to films, and over the next 25 or so years played everything from rampaging Apache chiefs to comic-relief sidekicks. A large, round-faced man, his distinctive voice--a deep, resonant bass somewhat resembling Bluto's in the old \"Popeye\" cartoons--was instantly recognizable, and he had the distinction of not appearing to have aged much over his career, which is most likely attributable to the fact that he looked quite a bit younger than he actually was, so his \"aging\" wasn't all that noticeable. In addition to his \"serious\" roles, he had somewhat more light-hearted parts in several films, notably Red River (1948), where he traded quips with veteran scene-stealer Walter Brennan, and held his own quite well.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjZjUyNTgtYjY4My00ZGY3LTkyM2ItY2VhMzcwMWU3NjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0950385","name":"Chief Yowlachie","idIMDB":"nm0950385"},"actorId":"nm0950385","character":"Sitting Bull","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0034734","main":true},{"actorName":"Anne Schaefer","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0769584","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQ1OTQ2MTktNWNjOC00NDJlLWFhMmUtZjY0MWQzMzc1OWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_UY44_CR14,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 July 1870","placeOfBirth":" St. Louis, Missouri, USA","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Anne Schaefer was born on July 10, 1870 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.
