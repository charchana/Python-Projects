His mother was Irish, from County Longford, while his American-born father is of mostly Irish descent. Mel and his family moved to Australia in the late 1960s, settling in New South Wales, where Mel's paternal grandmother, contralto opera singer Eva Mylott, was born. After high school, Mel studied at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, performing at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts alongside future film thespians Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush. After college, Mel had a few stints on stage and starred in a few TV shows. Eventually, he was chosen to star in Mad Max (1979) and in a movie called Tim (1979), co-starring Piper Laurie. The small budgeted movie Mad Max (1979) made him known worldwide, while Tim (1979) garnered him an award for Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute (equivalent to the Oscar). Later, he went on to star in Gallipoli (1981), which earned him a second award for Best Actor from the AFI. In 1980, he married Robyn Moore and had seven children. In 1984, Mel made his American debut in The Bounty (1984), which co-starred Anthony Hopkins. Then in 1987, Mel starred in what would become his signature series, Lethal Weapon (1987), in which he played \"Martin Riggs\". In 1990, he took on the interesting starring role in Hamlet (1990), which garnered him some critical praise. He also made the more endearing Forever Young (1992) and the somewhat disturbing The Man Without a Face (1993). 1995 brought his most famous role as \"Sir William Wallace\" in Braveheart (1995), for which he won two Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director. From there, he made such box office hits as The Patriot (2000), Ransom (1996), and Payback (1999). Today, Mel remains an international superstar mogul, continuously topping the Hollywood power lists as well as the Most Beautiful and Sexiest lists.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUzOTMwNTM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMTUxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000154","name":"Mel Gibson","idIMDB":"nm0000154"},"actorId":"nm0000154","character":"Guy Hamilton","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0235044","main":true},{"actorName":"Bembol Roco","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734368","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFkYmVkYzEtNTY3Yi00NzFmLThlYzUtNWNjZGFjNTU2MzNlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI5NjIyMw@@._V1_UY44_CR23,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 November 1953","placeOfBirth":"","birthName":"Rafael Aranda Roco Jr.","bio":"Bembol Roco was born on November 20, 1953 as Rafael Aranda Roco Jr. He is an actor and director, known for Little Nanay (2015), L'année de tous les dangers (1982) and One True Love (2012).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFkYmVkYzEtNTY3Yi00NzFmLThlYzUtNWNjZGFjNTU2MzNlL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI5NjIyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734368","name":"Bembol Roco","idIMDB":"nm0734368"},"actorId":"nm0734368","character":"Kumar","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Domingo Landicho","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484770","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Domingo Landicho is an actor and writer, known for L'année de tous les dangers (1982), The Bet Collector (2006) and Bulaklak ng Maynila (1999).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484770","name":"Domingo Landicho","idIMDB":"nm0484770"},"actorId":"nm0484770","character":"Hortono","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Hermino De Guzman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208772","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Hermino De Guzman is an actor, known for L'année de tous les dangers (1982) and Buddies (1983).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0208772","name":"Hermino De Guzman","idIMDB":"nm0208772"},"actorId":"nm0208772","character":"Immigration Officer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Murphy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614526","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTIyNzAxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTc5NTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 May 1938","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Michael George Murphy","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Michael Murphy was born in Los Angeles, California, to Georgia Arlyn (née Money), a teacher, and Bearl Branton Murphy, a salesman. After a hitch in the Marine Corps, Murphy attended the University of Arizona, Tuscon, and then went to U.C.L.A. to get his teaching credential. From 1962 to 1964, he taught high school English and drama in Los Angeles. Murphy's most notable appearance was as Woody Allen's best friend Yale, the self-tortured adulterer, in Allen's masterpiece Manhattan (1979). The two had acted together earlier in Martin Ritt's The Front (1976) and had become good friends. Surpisingly, despite the excellent performance Murphy gave in the film, Allen hasn't used him again. Murphy's career as a first-rate supporting player has continued for four decades, with major parts in Paul Mazursky's An Unmarried Woman (1978), which he calls \"the first of the whining yuppies,\" Peter Weir's L'année de tous les dangers (1982), and Oliver Stone's Salvador (1986). He also has worked with such significant directors as Elia Kazan in The Arrangement (1969), Tim Burton in Batman Returns (1992), and Paul Thomas Anderson in Magnolia (1999). Murphy recently co-starred in John Sayles' Silver City (2004), as a U.S. Senator who is the father of a gubernatorial candidate played by Oscar-winner Chris Cooper, standing-in for the pre-presidential George W. Bush. Murphy is perhaps best known for his long collaboration with director Robert Altman that stretches back to the beginning of his career. \"I was right out of the University of Arizona,\" Murphy reminisced during a 2004 interview, \"and a friend said, 'Go to Bob. He's using young guys for this Army thing.'\" Altman was directing the World War II television series Combat! (1962), and Altman cast him in the show without an audition. \"Bob took me under his wing. He told me, 'You're never going to be a movie star. But you'll do some interesting things.' Bob was maybe 35 years old when we met. He'd never play it safe. He has amazing fortitude and guts.\" In addition to Combat! (1962) and the Altman-directed TV movie Nightmare in Chicago (1964), Murphy has appeared in seven theatrical movies directed by Altman between 1968 and 1996: Countdown (1967), That Cold Day in the Park (1969), MASH (1970), Brewster McCloud (1970), McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), Nashville (1975), and Kansas City (1996). Murphy has also appeared in Altman's TV adaptation of Herman Wouk's play The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial (1988) and in two cable-TV mini-series for him: Tanner '88 (1988) and Tanner on Tanner (2004). About Altman, Murphy says, \"I adore the guy. If you're getting married or divorced, or someone dies, you want to talk to him about it. He's so strong, he sees the big picture. An extraordinary man.\" Murphy played the title role of Michigan Congressman Jack Tanner in Altman's ground-breaking HBO series Tanner '88 (1988), which was scripted by Garry Trudeau of \"Doonesbury\" fame. The fictional Tanner ran for president in the Democratic Party primaries of 1988, alongside George Bush (whom Murphy himself \"plays\" in Silver City (2004)), Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, and Pat Robertson, with some \"guest appearances\" by Ronald Reagan along the way. The \"candidate\" Tanner actually interacted on-camera with candidates Gary Hart, Bob Dole, and Jesse Jackson, and with the journalists Linda Ellerbee and Chris Matthews. During the progress of the series' eleven episodes, Tanner increasingly became alienated as the grueling political marathon went on. He was portrayed as an intellectual troubled by sound-bite politics and the public person he was compelled to create for the media-fueled electoral machine that vetted the candidates for the public at the other end of the cathode-ray tube. Tanner eventually realizes he lacks the all-consuming drive to be a successful presidential candidate under such a system. A caustic look at American politics from a liberal-left-anarchist point of view, \"Tanner '88\" won the prize for best television series at the Festival International de Programmes Audiovisuels in Cannes in the fall of 1988. The mini-series ranks among the best and most important of television programs. Altman-Murphy-Trudeau reprised Tanner with \"Tanner on Tanner\" (2004), in which the character did not run but commented on the political process and on the media circus accompanying the pursuit for the nation's highest office. About the new cable mini-series, Murphy says, \"Bob is showing the nastiness behind all campaigns. I don't think it's a polemic. In Bob's case, you vote for the Democrat, but be careful of what you ask for. Bob is very cynical.\" Despite decades of solid performances in a plethora of movies, Murphy remains anonymous to the public at large. Arriving in a limousine at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival premiere of Silver City (2004), he got out of the car and was unrecognized. When the publicists eventually realized he was a star of the film, Murphy was ordered back into the limousine so that he could exit it again, and the paparazzi could photograph him. \"I'm in this fun position where people don't really know who I am,\" Murphy said when recounting the incident. \"It's a good look at life. You get a perspective.\" In 1988, Michael Murphy married the co-star of his short-lived television show Hard Copy (1987), the actress Wendy Crewson. She has also appeared with her husband in Tanner '88 (1988) and in the theatrical films Folks! (1992) and Sleeping Dogs Lie (1998). They have two children, a daughter, Maggie Murphy, born in 1989, and a son, John (\"Jack\") Branton Murphy, born in 1992.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTIyNzAxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTc5NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614526","name":"Michael Murphy","idIMDB":"nm0614526"},"actorId":"nm0614526","character":"Pete Curtis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Noel Ferrier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0274817","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 December 1930","placeOfBirth":" Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Noel Ferrier was born on December 20, 1930 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Her father, TV producer Sylvester L. Weaver Jr., originally wanted to name her Flavia, because of his passion for Roman history (he had already named her elder brother Trajan). Her mother, Elizabeth Inglis (née Desiree Mary Lucy Hawkins), was an English actress who had sacrificed her career for a family. Sigourney grew up in a virtual bubble of guiltless bliss, being taken care of by nannies and maids. By 1959, the Weavers had resided in 30 different households. In 1961, Sigourney began attending the Brearley Girls Academy, but her mother moved her to another New York private school, Chapin. Sigourney was quite a bit taller than most of her other classmates (at the age of 13, she was already 5' 10\"), resulting in her constantly being laughed at and picked on; in order to gain their acceptance, she took on the role of class clown. In 1962, her family moved to San Francisco briefly, an unpleasant experience for her. Later, they moved back east to Connecticut, where she became a student at the Ethel Walker School, facing the same problems as before. In 1963, she changed her name to \"Sigourney\", after the character \"Sigourney Howard\" in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" (her own birth name, Susan, was in honor of her mother's best friend, explorer Susan Pretzlik). Sigourney had already starred in a school drama production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and, in 1965, she worked during the summer with a stock troupe, performing in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\" (she didn't star in the latter because she was taller than the lead actor!). After graduating from school in 1967, she spent some months in a kibbutz in Israel. At that time, she became engaged to reporter Aaron Latham, but they soon broke up. In 1969, Sigourney enrolled in Stanford University, majoring in English Literature. She also participated in school plays, especially Japanese Noh plays. By that time she was living in a tree house, alongside a male friend, dressed in elf-like clothes! After completing her studies in 1971, she applied for the Yale School of Drama in New Haven. Despite appearing at the audition reading a Bertolt Brecht speech and wearing a rope-like belt, she was accepted by the school but her professors rejected her, because of her height, and kept typecasting her as prostitutes and old women (whereas classmate Meryl Streep was treated almost reverently). However, in 1973, while making her theatrical debut with \"Watergate Classics\", she met up with a team of playwrights and actors and began hanging around with them, resulting in long-term friendships with Christopher Durang, Kate McGregor-Stewart and Albert Innaurato. In 1974, she starred in such plays as Aristophanes' \"Frogs\" and Durang's \"The Nature and Purpose of the Universe\" and \"Daryl and Carol and Kenny and Jenny\", as \"Jenny\". After finishing her studies that year, she began seriously pursuing a stage career, but her height kept being a hindrance. However, she continued working on stage with Durang (in \"Titanic\" [1975]) and Innaurato (in \"Gemini\" [1976]). Other 1970s stage works included \"Marco Polo Sing a Song\", \"The Animal Kingdom\", \"A Flea in Her Ear\", \"The Constant Husband\", \"Conjuring an Event\" and others. However, the one that really got her noticed was \"Das Lusitania Songspiel\", a play she co-wrote with Durang and in which she starred for two seasons, from 1979 to 1981. She was also up for a Drama Desk Award for it. During the mid-70s, she appeared in several TV spots and even starred as \"Avis Ryan\" in the soap opera Somerset (1970). In 1977, she was cast in the role Shelley Duvall finally played in Annie Hall (1977), after rejecting the part due to prior stage commitments. In the end, however, Woody Allen offered her a part in the film that, while short (she was on-screen for six seconds), made many people sit up and take notice. She later appeared in Madman (1978) and, of course, Alien (1979). The role of the tough, uncompromising \"Ripley\" made Sigourney an \"overnight\" star and brought her a British Award Nomination. She next appeared in Eyewitness (1981) and L'année de tous les dangers (1982), the latter being a great success in Australia that won an Oscar and brought Sigourney and co-star Mel Gibson to Cannes in 1983. The same year she delivered an honorary Emmy award to her father, a few months before her uncle, actor Doodles Weaver, committed suicide. That year also brought her a romance with Jim Simpson, her first since having broken up two years previously with James M. McClure. She and Simpson were married on 1 October 1984. Sigourney had, meanwhile, played in the poorly received Deal of the Century (1983) and the mega-hit Ghostbusters (1984). She was also nominated for a Tony Award for her tour-de-force performance in the play \"Hurly Burly\". Then followed One Woman or Two (1985), Half Moon Street (1986) and Aliens (1986). The latter was a huge success, and Sigourney was nominated for both a Golden Globe and an Oscar. She then entered her most productive career period and snatched Academy Award nominations, in both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, for her intense portrayal of Dian Fossey in Gorillas in the Mist (1988) and her delicious performance as a double-crossing, power-hungry corporate executive in Working Girl (1988). She ended up losing in both, but made up for it to a degree by winning both Golden Globes. After appearing in a documentary about fashion photographer Helmut Newton, Helmut Newton: Frames from the Edge (1989), and reprising her role in the sequel Ghostbusters II (1989), she discovered she was pregnant and retired from public life for a while. She gave birth to her daughter, Charlotte Simpson, on 13 April 1990, and returned to the movies as a (now skinhead) Ripley in Alien 3 (1992) and a gorgeous \"Queen Isabella of Spain\" in 1492: Christophe Colomb (1992), her second film with director Ridley Scott. She starred in the political comedy Dave (1993) alongside Kevin Kline, and then a Roman Polanski thriller, Death and the Maiden (1994). In 1995, she was seen in Jeffrey (1995) and Copycat (1995). The next year, she \"trod the boards\" in \"Sex and Longing\", yet another Durang play. She hadn't performed in the theater in many years before that play, her last stage performances occurring in the 1980s in \"As You Like It\" (1981), \"Beyond Therapy\" (1981), \"The Marriage of 'Bette and Boo'\" (1985) and \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1986). In 1997, she was the protagonist in Grimm's Snow White: A Tale of Terror (1997), Ice Storm (1997) and Alien: Resurrection (1997). Her performance in Ice Storm (1997) got her a BAFTA prize and another Golden Globe nod. She also gave excellent performances in A Map of the World (1999) and the sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest (1999). Her next comedy, Company Man (2000), wasn't quite so warmly welcomed critically and financially, however. She next played a sexy con artist in Heartbreakers (2001) and had a voice role in Big Bad Love (2001). Her father died at the age of 93. Sigourney herself has recently starred in Tadpole (2000) and is planning a cinematic version of The Guys (2002), the enthralling September 11th one-act drama she played on stage on late 2001. At age 60, she played a crucial role in Avatar (2009), which became the top box-office hit of all time. The film reunited her with her Aliens (1986) director James Cameron. Her beauty, talent, and hard-work keeps the ageless actress going, and she has continued to win respect from her fans and directors.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MTcyNTE3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244","name":"Sigourney Weaver","nicknames":["The Actress's Actress","The Sci-Fi Queen"],"idIMDB":"nm0000244"},"actorId":"nm0000244","character":"Jill Bryant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0233226","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0086617","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086617","business":{"budget":{"money":"$13,000,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$35,000","country":"USA","day":"21","month":"01","year":"1983","remarks":"1 Screen"}],"gross":[{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/1983/\">1983</a>"},{"money":"21,191 (West","country":"Germany","day":"31","month":"12","year":"1983","remarks":""},{"money":null,"country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":"","remarks":"<a href=\"/year/1982/\">1982</a>"}],"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 55 min (115 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color (Metrocolor)"],"aspectRatio":["2.35 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Panavision (anamorphic)"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.2","metascore":"65","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Artransa Park Film Studios, Mobbs Lane, Epping, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"}],"rated":"PG","awards":[{"award":"Academy Awards, USA 1984","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Oscar","categories":[{"category":"Best Actress in a Supporting Role","names":[{"name":"Linda Hunt","id":"nm0001373","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Golden Globes, USA 1984","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Golden Globe","categories":[{"category":"Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture","names":[{"name":"Linda Hunt","id":"nm0001373","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Australian Film Institute 1983","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won AFI Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Actress in a Supporting Role","names":[{"name":"Linda Hunt","id":"nm0001373","role":null}]}]},{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated AFI Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Film","names":[{"name":"Jim McElroy","id":"nm0568434","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Director","names":[{"name":"Peter Weir","id":"nm0001837","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Actor in a Lead Role","names":[{"name":"Mel Gibson","id":"nm0000154","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Screenplay, Adapted","names":[{"name":"C.J.
