Practically out of nowhere, he was discovered by a Warner Bros. TV talent scout and signed without any previous experience. Besides appearing as a guest on many TV westerns like Maverick (1957) and Cheyenne (1955), he earned his own series Sugarfoot (1957) in which he played an unlikely western hero. The program ran a respectable four seasons. In its aftermath, he focused on films, the most important being Merrill's Marauders (1962), and co-starred in a two-year stage tour of \"Never Too Late\". His gawky comedy style was put to the test as well in the '60s with two short-lived series, Hey, Landlord (1966) and Blondie (1968), the latter in which he played Dagwood Bumstead. He also backed up Elvis Presley in three of his mediocre film efforts. He also wed Carol Burnett's younger sister, Chrissie Burnett; they divorced in later years. As is often the case with an instant TV star, there is an eventual downswing and, in the late '60s, Will started to flounder badly. In his case, he turned his back on Hollywood and became, of all things, a ringmaster and clown for various circuses. Will has also worked behind-the-scenes for NBC and still attends conventions on occasion, more recently the 2004 Cincinnati Old Time Radio Convention where he received the \"Stone-Waterman Award\".","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0404298","name":"Will Hutchins","idIMDB":"nm0404298"},"actorId":"nm0404298","character":"Coley","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Millie Perkins","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0674012","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzODIwODEzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYxNzkwNA@@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 May 1938","placeOfBirth":" Passaic, New Jersey, USA","bio":"Millie Perkins was born on May 12, 1938 in Passaic, New Jersey, USA.

Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received Oscar nomination in every decade from the 1960s through the 1990s. Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937 in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a show-girl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian-American show-man, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show-business. Jack's mother's ancestry was Irish, English, as well as German, Scottish and Welsh. Nicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including The Little Shop of Horrors (1960). Nicholson's first turn in the director's chair was for Drive, He Said (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for The Trip (1967), and co-wrote Head (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Easy Rider (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson's film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Five Easy Pieces (1970). Nicholson's other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski's noir masterpiece Chinatown (1974) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar. The 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel The Shining (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including Terms of Endearment (1983) which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; Prizzi's Honor (1985) and The Witches of Eastwick (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton's Batman (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as A Few Good Men (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Mars Attacks! (1996). Although a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson's acting range reappeared in The Departed (2006), the actor's most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets (1997), for which he won his third Academy Award. Shades of this persona are apparent in About Schmidt (2002), Something's Gotta Give (2003) and The Bucket List (2007). In addition to his Academy Awards and Oscar nominations, Nicholson has seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. He also became one of the youngest actors to receive the American Film Institute's Life Achievement award in 1994. Nicholson has five children: Eldest daughter Jennifer Nicholson (b. 1963), from his marriage to Sandra Knight which ended in 1968; Caleb James Goddard (b. 1970) with Susan Anspach; Honey Hollman (b. 1981) with Danish supermodel, Winnie Hollman; and Lorraine Nicholson (b. 1990) and Ray Nicholson (b. 1992) with Rebecca Broussard. Nicholson's longest relationship was the seventeen years he spent with actress Anjelica Huston; this ended when Broussard become pregnant with his child.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3OTY0ODk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzE4Njc4._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197","name":"Jack Nicholson","nicknames":["Mulholland Man","Nick"],"idIMDB":"nm0000197"},"actorId":"nm0000197","character":"Billy Spear","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Warren Oates","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643105","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDUwMDkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3NDcyNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 July 1928","placeOfBirth":" Depoy, Kentucky, USA","birthName":"Warren Mercer Oates","height":"5' 11¼\" (1.81 m)","bio":"Warren Oates was an American character actor of the 1960s and 1970s and early 1980s whose distinctive style and intensity brought him to offbeat leading roles. Oates was born in Depoy, a very small Kentucky town. He was the son of Sarah Alice (Mercer) and Bayless Earle Oates, a general store owner. He attended high school in Louisville, continuing on to the University of Louisville and military service with the U.S. Marines. In college he became interested in the theatre and in 1954 headed for New York to make his mark as an actor. However, his first real job in television was, as it had been for James Dean before him, testing the contest gags on the game show Beat the Clock (1950). He did numerous menial jobs while auditioning, including serving as the hat-check man at the nightclub \"21\". By 1957 he had begun appearing in live dramas such as Studio One in Hollywood (1948), but Oates' rural drawl seemed more fitted for the Westerns that were proliferating on the big screen at the time, so he moved to Hollywood and immediately stared getting steady work as an increasingly prominent supporting player, often as either craven or vicious types. With his role as one of the Hammond brothers in the Sam Peckinpah masterpiece Ride the High Country (1962), Oates found a niche both as an actor and as a colleague of one of the most distinguished and distinctive directors of the period. Peckinpah used Oates repeatedly, and Oates, in large part due to the prominence given him by Peckinpah, became one of those rare character actors whose name and face is as familiar as those of many leading stars. He began to play roles which, while still character parts, were also leads, particularly in cult hits like Two-Lane Blacktop (1971) and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974). Although never destined to be a traditional leading man, Oates remained one of Hollywood's most valued and in-demand character players up until his sudden death from a heart attack on April 3, 1982 at the age of 53. His final two films, Tough Enough (1983) (filmed in late 1981) and Blue Thunder (1983) (filmed in early 1980), were released over one year after his death and were dedicated to his memory.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxMDUwMDkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3NDcyNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643105","name":"Warren Oates","idIMDB":"nm0643105"},"actorId":"nm0643105","character":"Willett Gashade","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Charles Eastman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0247631","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 September 1929","placeOfBirth":" Hollywood, California, USA","birthName":"Charles Kemper Eastman","bio":"Charles Eastman was born on September 18, 1929 in Hollywood, California, USA as Charles Kemper Eastman.
