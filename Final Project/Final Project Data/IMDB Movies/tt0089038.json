He was known professionally as Gerry Sundquist, but always affectionately known as Ged to his friends. He grew up in Chorlton with his older brother and younger sister. He developed an interest in acting at primary school and joined the Stretford Children's Theatre whilst still at school - St. Augustine's R.C. Grammar School in Wythenshawe. On leaving school at 16 he worked briefly on the night shift at the Kellogg's factory in Manchester, but keen to pursue his acting career he soon moved to London. His first real breakthrough came in 1974 when he was cast in his first professional TV role as Jim in the popular 10-part Granada TV serial 'Soldier & Me' followed by the role of Billy in 'The Siege of Golden Hill' in 1975. He also appeared in many theatre productions in the mid 1970s - the Young Vic's production of 'All Walk of Leg', 'The Fantastic Fairground' and 'Macbeth' in 1975, following on with a memorable portrayal of Alan Strang in John Dexter's production of 'Equus' at the National Theatre in 1976. His other TV and film roles include an appearance as Malic in 'The Dorcons' episode of 'Space 1999', in 1978, the starring role in 'Music Machine' in 1979, Michael Radlet in the TV drama, 'The Mallens' in 1980 and one of his finest roles, 'Pip' in the 1981 BBC adaption of 'Great Expectations'. Appearances in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' in 1982 and 'The Last Days of Pompeii' and 'Don't Open 'til Christmas' in 1984, followed. In between filming in various locations around the world, Gerry lived in the Cotswolds village of Barnsley for a time and then moved back to London. However, his personal life and career seemed to go into a downward spiral in the mid 1980s. Throughout his most difficult times he was supported by his loving family, especially his brother Geoffrey and with his help Gerry seemed to gradually overcome his problems and resume his acting career. In 1992 he played a character called Jimmy Matthews in 'Lost Boy' - an episode of the long running ITV series, 'The Bill' but this was Gerry's last TV appearance. Despite his apparent hope for the future, Gerry took his own life by jumping in front of a train at Norbiton train station on Sunday, 1st August, 1993. He was only 37 years old. He left a suicide note apologising to his family for \"letting you down\". His funeral took place in Kingston, Surrey. Gerry's brother, Geoffrey was inspired to create a lasting tribute to Gerry's life and created a children's story - 'Father Christmas and the Missing Reindeer', inspired by childhood memories of time spent with Gerry and their family at Christmas time. The book was published and later made into an animated short film and released in 1997 - dedicated to Gerry's memory. After his first book, Geoffrey began writing a screenplay for a film entitled 'The Whistling Boys', a story about two brothers, set during the First World War. However, the film was never realised as, sadly, Geoffrey Sundquist passed away in March, 2005.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0839213","name":"Gerry Sundquist","nicknames":["Sunny"],"idIMDB":"nm0839213"},"actorId":"nm0839213","character":"Cliff Boyd","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kelly Baker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048639","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Kelly Baker is an actress, known for Slaughter High (1986) and Don't Open Till Christmas (1984).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048639","name":"Kelly Baker","idIMDB":"nm0048639"},"actorId":"nm0048639","character":"'Experience' Girl","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kevin Lloyd","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516053","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 March 1949","placeOfBirth":" Derby, Derbyshire, England, UK","birthName":"Kevin Reardon Lloyd","bio":"Short, stocky, balding character actor who found fame on British TV in The Bill (1984) but became an alcoholic and died in a clinic attempting to dry out less than a week after being dismissed from the series.

Pat Astley grew up in the seaside town of Blackpool, Britain's 'Las Vegas of the North'. By the early 1970s Astley, with a baby daughter in tow, relocated to London in pursuit of fame and fortune. She drifted into 'blue movies' (i.e. hardcore shorts) made by 'John Lindsay' and George Harrison Marks. These were of sort of home projection 8mm porn films that would later be referenced in mainstream movies like Get Carter and O Lucky Man. Promoted as a 'mind-blowing orgy of Lolita lust' End of Term (1971) is in keeping with John Lindsay's taboo theme of dressing 20 something aged actresses as schoolgirls with its story of a 'teenybopper' spending her holiday seducing a chauffeur and a Maid (Astley). Astley's 'legit' debut came as an extra in 1976's I'm Not Feeling Myself Tonight (1976), a silly softcore comedy about a 'sex-ray' machine co-produced by an un-credited John Lindsay. After a few years working as a model for raunchy 'Men's Magazines', Astley bounced back in a surprisingly mainstream role as Young Mr Grace's Nurse in the 1977 run Are You Being Served? (1972). However the role was not to last and after 7 or 8 episodes she was replaced by Vivienne Johnson who was allocated dialogue and billing in the 'you have been watching' end credits, two attributes curiously denied to Astley. For the rest of the seventies Astley was part of an almost repertory company of young actresses who were required to do little but run around naked in background scenes of sex films. She had 'nude walk on' roles in Rosie Dixon - Night Nurse (1978), Adventures of a Plumber's Mate (1978),and The Stud (1978). 'Films and Filming magazine', a scholarly publication at heart who used racy images on their covers to increase sales, gave Astley an amusing career boost by name-checking and using a picture of her from the comedy Let's Get Laid (1978) for the cover of their Feb 1978 issue. The cover would seem to suggest that Astley was the star of the film, whilst in reality she appears in the film for all of eight seconds and isn't even billed in the end credits! There are a few exceptions to the 'blink and you'll miss her' nature of Astley's film career. Disco/Soap Opera flop The World Is Full of Married Men (1979), is the only film that uses her as an actress rather than a nude, despite her role as one of Anthony Franciosa's disco dollies being dubbed. While in the amateurish Queen of the Blues (1979), Astley played a stripper who gets scared by a skeleton spectre and delivers a fair share of the film's lewd backstage dialogue. Many British Sex films (and horror films for that matter) used pre-release 'publicity shots' to perk the interest of the public with stronger images than appeared in the films themselves. Astley's most memorable appearance in this respect was in promoting 'murder thriller with thrilling bodies' The Playbirds (1978), where she was ghoulishly depicted rubbing stage blood on her breasts. While many nudie actresses' career ended with the demise of the British Sex Film era, Astley's career stretched to one further movie. Don't Open Till Christmas (1984) was a cheapo horror film partly moneyed by a video distributor who wished to get into film financing after several of his tape releases had been prosecuted as 'Video Nasties'. Astley's Playbirds co-star 'Alan Lake' played a psychopath murdering anyone dressed as Father Christmas. Coincidently Astley's 'Are You Being Served' debut was in an episode entitled 'The Father Christmas Affair' and featured the Grace Brothers staff dressing up as Father Christmases as well. In the film Astley enjoys a semi-autobiographical role of a nude model who encounters the Santa hating psycho down a back alley. Sadly, 'Don't Open 'Til Christmas' did nothing for anyone's career, and Astley never acted again. She was last heard of working part time in a shop in Lancashire, at least avoiding the tragic legacies of several of her contemporaries.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0040030","name":"Pat Astley","nicknames":["Blackpool Patricia"],"idIMDB":"nm0040030"},"actorId":"nm0040030","character":"Sharon","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Laurence Harrington","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364309","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Laurence Harrington is an actor, known for Don't Open Till Christmas (1984), Double vue (1991) and Car Trouble (1986).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0364309","name":"Laurence Harrington","idIMDB":"nm0364309"},"actorId":"nm0364309","character":"Kate's Father","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ken Halliwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0356673","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Ken Halliwell is an actor, known for Don't Open Till Christmas (1984), To Encourage the Others (1972) and The Stanley Baxter Hour (1982).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0356673","name":"Ken Halliwell","idIMDB":"nm0356673"},"actorId":"nm0356673","character":"Restaurant Commissionaire","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Ray Marioni","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0548011","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1933","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Remo Marioni","bio":"Ray Marioni was born in 1933 in London, England as Remo Marioni.
