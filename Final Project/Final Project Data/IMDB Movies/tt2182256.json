In 1990, he went on to study drama at Lon Morris Jr. College. While there, he was awarded the Academic Excellence Award for Drama. He was also named Most Likely to Succeed and Sophomore Beau. During this time, Alan was also an active member of the Delta Psi Omega fraternity. After leaving LMJC, Alan went on to study at the prestigious Juilliard conservatory but left in 1996 before earning a degree. After a number of smaller stage productions and a small role in the movie Patch Adams (1998), Alan landed his first Broadway role in 1999 with \"Epic Proportions.\" He quickly became a sought-after comedic actor, with roles in such films as 28 Days (2000) and A Knight's Tale (2001). In 2002, Alan got the role of Wash, the wise-cracking pilot of Serenity on the short-lived series Firefly (2002). Although it lasted only eleven episodes, this may be Alan's most well-known and best-loved role. No other networks would buy the failed series, but Universal Pictures began courting creator Joss Whedon to produce a big-screen version of the series. While awaiting the final news of Firefly's fate, Alan played the beloved Steve the Pirate in the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) and the voice of the robot Sonny in I, Robot (2004). In 2005, Alan finally reprised the role of Wash in Serenity (2005), the feature-film version of the series Firefly. The same year, he went back to Broadway from June to November, taking over the role of Lancelot for Hank Azaria in the successful musical \"Spamalot.\" He lives in New York City but also has a place in Los Angeles, California","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0MzEwNDUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE1MDAzOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876138","name":"Alan Tudyk","idIMDB":"nm0876138"},"actorId":"nm0876138","character":"Jack Roth","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Katie Findlay","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3818748","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk1MjcyODI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY3NTc5OA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 August 1990","placeOfBirth":" Windsor, Ontario, Canada","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Katie Findlay was born on August 28, 1990 in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

The Founder is the true story of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc and is being released through The Weinstein Company. Katie was born in Montgomery, Alabama where she spent the first two years of her life before her family was moved to Patuxent River Naval Base in California, MD. Katie comes from both Irish and Polish descent; both great grandparents were immigrants who have unique stories of their journeys to America. Her mother, a Breast Cancer survivor, and her stepmother's passing due to stage 4 Melanoma Skin Cancer have played an important factor in her involvement in several charities. These include The Susan G. Koman For The Cure Foundation, American Cancer Society's Relay For Life, The Humane Society as well as Prevention of Child Abuse and Trafficking causes. After graduating high school in Maryland, Katie went on to capture the Eugene O'Neil Award for Outstanding Performance while attending Shenandoah Conservatory of Music (now called Shenandoah University) in Winchester, VA. Katie graduated with a BFA in Musical Theatre while earning Magna Cum Laude honors. Upon graduating college, Katie moved to NYC to pursue her acting career and was quickly cast in the musical Quilters. Rehearsals were in Atlanta due to the show touring the South Eastern coast. Katie then moved to Atlanta to better facilitate the rehearsal and touring schedule. While living in Atlanta Katie has performed with several of the best theaters including: Theatrical Outfit, Rialto Center for the Performing Arts, Theatre on the Square, The Springer Opera House, as well as the Alliance Theater. Her theatrical roles include: Chess, Pump Boys and Dinettes, Little Shop of Horrors, Sheer Madness, The People Vs. Mona as well as five years in A Christmas Carol. After receiving her first Television role on Dawson's Creek, Katie spent several years guest starring on Television before she landed a recurring role on the ABC Television Pilot Hollis & Rae. This helped lead to roles in the Feature Films: We Are Marshall, Daddy's Little Girls and One Missed Call. Katie's first big break came playing the role of Marilyn Polarski in the Lifetime Television hit Army Wives. Shortly after her work on Army Wives concluded, Katie picked up a voiceover role for writer and producer Dave Willlis' Series Squidbillies as Linda and again as Irina. Katie teamed up with Willis again in his live-action Television Pilot for Adult Swim titled Duckworth and again in several episodes of his new Television Series airing on the Adult Swim network as well as the TV shows/MOWs: Coma, The Jury, Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell & Eastbound & Down (among others). In addition to her continued work in Television, Katie has been acting steadily in Film, with notable turns in high-profile Studio Films as: Life As We Know It, Joyful Noise, The Hunger Games, Goat Island, What To Expect When You're Expecting, Devil's Knot, The Watch & Premature.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzgwMjQxODE5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE5MzY4OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2530026","name":"Kate Kneeland","idIMDB":"nm2530026"},"actorId":"nm2530026","character":"Anne Crabbe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Glennellen Anderson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4740861","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMTg0MTI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc5MTM0OTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Glennellen Anderson is an actress, known for Stranger Things (2016), Premature (2014) and Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMTg0MTI5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc5MTM0OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4740861","name":"Glennellen Anderson","idIMDB":"nm4740861"},"actorId":"nm4740861","character":"Girl in Locker Room #1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cara Mantella","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2278056","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzOTk4NTkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg1NDkwNjE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Cara Mantella is an actress, known for The Founder (2016), Christmas Cupid (2010) and Premature (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzOTk4NTkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg1NDkwNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2278056","name":"Cara Mantella","idIMDB":"nm2278056"},"actorId":"nm2278056","character":"Ms. Hartnett","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Parisa Johnston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3966712","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg3NDkyMDQ0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ0MDc1OTE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Parisa Johnston is an Atlanta based Actress known for The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016), Sabotage (2014), The Good Lie (2014) and Everything's for Sale (2011).
