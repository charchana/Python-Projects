The entertaining plots, compelling characters, and breathtaking animation in his films have earned him international renown from critics as well as public recognition within Japan. The Walt Disney Company's commitment to introduce the films to the rest of the world will let more people appreciate the high-quality works he has given the movie-going public. Hayao Miyazaki was born in Tôkyô on January 5, 1941. He started his career in 1963 as an animator at the studio Toei Douga studio, and was subsequently involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he commanded attention with his incredible drawing ability and the seemingly endless stream of movie ideas he proposed. In 1971, he moved to the A Pro studio with Isao Takahata, then to Nippon Animation in 1973, where he was heavily involved in the World Masterpiece Theater TV animation series for the next five years. In 1978, he directed his first TV series, Conan, le fils du futur (1978) (Conan, The Boy in Future), then moved to Tôkyô Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first movie, the classic The Castle of Cagliostro (1979). In 1984, he released Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), based on the manga (comic) of the same title he had started two years before. The success of the film led to the establishment of a new animation studio, Studio Ghibli (Sutajio Jiburi), at which Miyazaki has since directed, written, and produced many other films with Takahata and, more recently, Toshio Suzuki. All of these films enjoyed critical and box office successes. In particular, Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke (1997) received the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Film and was the highest-grossing (about USD$150 million) domestic film in Japan's history at the time of its release. In addition to animation, Miyazaki also draws manga. His major work was the Nausicaä manga, an epic tale he worked on intermittently from 1982 to 1984 while he was busy making animated films. Another manga, Hikoutei Jidai, was later evolved into his 1992 film Porco Rosso (1992). Miyazaki's latest film is Howl's Moving Castle (2004), based on the novel by Diana Wynne Jones. Even though he has said this would be at last film, a statement he has said before after the completion of some of his earlier films, one hopes that additions to his extraordinary body of work will continue to be produced as long as he remains alive.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcyNjk2OTkwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0MTQ3Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503","name":"Hayao Miyazaki","nicknames":["the Japanese Walt Disney"],"idIMDB":"nm0594503"},"actorId":"nm0594503","character":"Himself","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yumiko Miyoshi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7259698","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"It looks like we don't have any Biography for Yumiko Miyoshi yet.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7259698","name":"Yumiko Miyoshi","idIMDB":"nm7259698"},"actorId":"nm7259698","character":"Herself, Hayao Miyazaki's production manager","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Toshio Suzuki","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0840699","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 August 1948","placeOfBirth":" Nagoya, Japan","bio":"Toshio Suzuki was born on August 19, 1948 in Nagoya, Japan.

Because his father, Hayao Miyazaki, is a world-famous filmmaker, he always had complex feeling towards his father. He decided not to work for anything related to animation, to avid to be compared with Hayao. However, the turning point came to his life in 1990s, which was the new project of construction of Studio Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo. He was in charge of the whole design of the museum, and became the first Managing Director. While Hayao was filming \"Hauru no ugoku shiro\", Toshio Suzuki, the producer, decided to let Goro direct the next Ghibli movie since he was impressed by Goro's talent of making decisions quickly and properly, and his ability to draw pictures. Therefore he directed \"Gedo Senki\", which is the first step of his career in the animated movie industry.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2066439","name":"Gorô Miyazaki","idIMDB":"nm2066439"},"actorId":"nm2066439","character":"Himself, Hayao Miyazaki's son","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Hisaishi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386749","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 December 1950","placeOfBirth":" Nagano, Japan","birthName":"Mamoru Fujisawa","bio":"Joe Hisaishi was born on December 6, 1950 in Nagano, Japan as Mamoru Fujisawa.
