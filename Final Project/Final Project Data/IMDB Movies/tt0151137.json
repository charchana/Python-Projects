In his younger days, he earned his living as a tradesman (time-served), but also fought as a semi-professional boxer. So good was he, he even fought for the British Heavyweight title. However, it was his experience of bare knuckle fighting that brought him to the attention of the producers of Crossing the Line (1990) starring the pre-Schindler's List (1993) Liam Neeson. He was initially asked to advise on the 'sport' but after several meetings it was decided to cast him in a prominent role, as Cutty Dawson.

His first acting experience soon after school in 1955, was an amateur production of 'Doctor in the House' which persuaded him he wanted to be an actor. After leaving school he worked in a bank and then for Central African Airlines. In 1958, he made his first trip from Rhodesia to England to get a lie of the land. In 1960 he moved to England and landed his first small role in the film Flame in the Streets (1960) and then played on of the bells boys in Arthur Koppits \"Oh Dad Poor Dad Mama's hung you in the Closet and I'm feeling so Sad\" (1961) with Stella Adler playing Madame Rosepettle. He then bluffed his way into Weekly Repertory in Barrow-in-Furness as Juvenile lead - terrified the while that he would be exposed as totally inexperienced. Recognising the need for training he auditioned three times for a bursary to RADA - each time only being accepted as a fee paying student which he couldn't afford - he finally sent for the last of his standby money (£200) he had left in Rhodesia and paid for the first term (1963)","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDEzMzcyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA5NzA1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0047549","name":"David Bailie","idIMDB":"nm0047549"},"actorId":"nm0047549","character":"English Judge","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Barber","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0053370","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"David Barber is an actor, known for The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999), Blackadder's Christmas Carol (1988) and Harry Enfield and Chums (1994).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0053370","name":"David Barber","idIMDB":"nm0053370"},"actorId":"nm0053370","character":"English Judge","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Christian Barbier","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1061663","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Christian Barbier is known for his work on The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999), Il cuore e la spada (1998) and Les Cordier, juge et flic (1992).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1061663","name":"Christian Barbier","idIMDB":"nm1061663"},"actorId":"nm1061663","character":"Captain","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Timothy Bateson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0061063","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk2MTBmOGUtOTI3Zi00NjYyLThhZTMtMGU3N2YwMjYxODU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 April 1926","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Timothy Dingwall Bateson","bio":"Prolific British character actor, adept at eccentric or whimsical impersonations, particularly of Dickensian characters. The son of law society president Sir Dingwall Bateson, he won a scholarship to Wadham College, where he trained for acting with the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Straight out of college, he was handpicked by Alberto Cavalcanti for the role of Lord Verisopht in the Ealing production of The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1947). Bateson made his theatrical debut at the Old Vic the following year in \"Twelfth Night\". He was highly acclaimed for his performance as Lucky in \"Waiting for Godot\", which he first performed at the Arts Theatre in London in 1955. Nothing, if not versatile, Bateson turned his considerable talents to a wide variety of diverse assignments, ranging from Shakespearean classics (Richard III (1955)) to social drama The Outsider (1948)) and lightweight farce (The Mouse That Roared (1959)). He was a longstanding member of the BBC radio repertory company and latterly much in demand for voice-over work, which included providing the voice of Kreacher in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007). Television saw him in small roles as scientists, police officers, clerks and the like, in numerous popular shows from The Avengers (1961) and Z Cars (1962) to Doctor Who (1963).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk2MTBmOGUtOTI3Zi00NjYyLThhZTMtMGU3N2YwMjYxODU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0061063","name":"Timothy Bateson","idIMDB":"nm0061063"},"actorId":"nm0061063","character":"English Judge","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"David Begg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066715","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDQwNTQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMwODcyODE@._V1_UY44_CR35,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"David Begg is an actor and producer, known for The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999), The Fifteen Streets (1989) and Britannic (2000).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDQwNTQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMwODcyODE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0066715","name":"David Begg","idIMDB":"nm0066715"},"actorId":"nm0066715","character":"Nobleman - Rouen's Castle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Christian Bergner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0074947","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Christian Bergner is known for his work on Taken (2008), Lucy (2014) and Le transporteur (2002).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0074947","name":"Christian Bergner","idIMDB":"nm0074947"},"actorId":"nm0074947","character":"Captain","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrew Birkin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001949","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 December 1945","placeOfBirth":" London, England, UK","birthName":"Andrew Timothy Birkin","bio":"Andrew Birkin was born on December 9, 1945 in London, England as Andrew Timothy Birkin.
