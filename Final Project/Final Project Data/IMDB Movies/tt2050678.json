She started her artistic career as a singer and theatre actress while still in high school. Although she was already making a living from acting, she decided to study Dramatic Arts and Music and was accepted at the renowned Conservatory of Vienna. After successfully graduating there she moved to Sydney and also completed a Master's Degree at the Australian Institute of Music. She was discovered for the film by the Austrian director Andreas Prochaska, whose comedy \"The unintentional kidnapping of Mrs. Elfriede Ott\" was a box-office hit and won the Austrian Film Acadamy Award in 2010 and led Monica to appearances in TV-series such as \"Soko Kitzbühel\" or \"Schnell ermittelt\", as well as feature films like \"Tatort\" or \"Akte Grüninger\". Monica Reyes is married to Emanuel Heisenberg, a grandchild of the physicist and Nobel Price winner Werner Heisenberg.
