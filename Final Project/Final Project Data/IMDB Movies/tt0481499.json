He is of Italian (father) and Polish, German, and English (mother) descent. Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s. Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career. His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984). In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage (b.1992). In 2004, he married Alice Kim Cage, with whom he has a son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDM4Nzk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwNjExOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115","name":"Nicolas Cage","nicknames":["Nick"],"idIMDB":"nm0000115"},"actorId":"nm0000115","character":"Grug","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0232047","main":true},{"actorName":"Emma Stone","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1297015","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NjM1NDkyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyNTY1MjE@._V1.._UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 November 1988","placeOfBirth":" Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","birthName":"Emily Jean Stone","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Emily Jean \"Emma\" Stone was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista (Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, a contracting company founder and CEO.

She appeared in many more productions through her early teens until, at the age of 15, she decided that she wanted to make acting her career. The official story is that she made a PowerPoint presentation, backed by Madonna's \"Hollywood\" and itself entitled \"Project Hollywood\", in an attempt to persuade her parents to allow her to drop out of school and move to Los Angeles. The pitch was successful and she and her mother moved to LA with her schooling completed at home while she spent her days auditioning. She had her TV breakthrough when she won the part of Laurie Partridge in the VH1 talent/reality show In Search of the Partridge Family (2004) which led to a number of small TV roles in the following years. Her movie debut was as Jules in Superbad (2007) and, after a string of successful performances, her leading role as Olive in Easy A (2010) established her as a star.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NjM1NDkyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgyNTY1MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1297015","name":"Emma Stone","idIMDB":"nm1297015"},"actorId":"nm1297015","character":"Eep","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0209747","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryan Reynolds","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI3ODk1MTMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyNTE2Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 October 1976","placeOfBirth":" Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","birthName":"Ryan Rodney Reynolds","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Ryan Rodney Reynolds was born on October 23, 1976 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the youngest of four children. His father, James Chester Reynolds, was a food wholesaler, and his mother, Tammy, worked as a retail-store saleswoman. Between 1991-93, Ryan appeared in Fifteen (1990), a Nickleodeon series taped in Florida with many other Canadian actors. After the series ended, he returned to Vancouver where he played in a series of forgettable television movies. He did small roles in Glenn Close's Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (1995) and CBS's update of In Cold Blood (1996). However, his run of luck had led him to decide to quit acting. One night, he ran into fellow Vancouver actor and native Chris William Martin. Martin found Ryan rather despondent and told him to pack everything: they were going to head to Los Angeles, California. The two stayed in a cheap Los Angeles motel. On the first night of their stay, Reynolds' jeep was rolled downhill and stripped. For the next four months, Ryan drove it without doors. In 1997, he landed the role of Berg in Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998). Initially, the show was reviled by critics and seemed desperate for any type of ratings success. However, it was renewed for a second season but with a provision for a makeover by former Roseanne (1988) writer Kevin Abbott. The show became a minor success and has led to additional film roles for Ryan, most notably in the last-ever MGM film, a remake of The Amityville Horror (2005). Ryan was engaged to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, another Nickelodeon veteran, between 2004-2006. He has been married to Blake Lively since September 9, 2012. They have two children. He was previous married to Scarlett Johansson.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI3ODk1MTMyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyNTE2Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005351","name":"Ryan Reynolds","idIMDB":"nm0005351"},"actorId":"nm0005351","character":"Guy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0232046","main":true},{"actorName":"Catherine Keener","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001416","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMzQ1Mzg1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE4MTU5MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 March 1959","placeOfBirth":" Miami, Florida, USA","birthName":"Catherine Ann Keener","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Catherine Keener is an American actress, Oscar-nominated for her roles in the independent films Being John Malkovich (1999) and Capote (2005). Acclaimed in her community for her quirky roles in independent film and mainstream such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), Keener got her start as a casting director in New York City. Catherine Ann Keener was born in Miami, Florida, and was raised in Hialeah, FL. She is the daughter of Evelyn (Jamiel) and James Keener, who owned an auto shop. She is of Lebanese (mother) and English, Scottish, and German (father) descent. Keener attended Wheaton College in Massachusetts. She began taking acting classes when she was unable to sign up for a photography class. After graduating, Keener managed a McDonalds in New York City before becoming an assistant casting director and soon relocating to Los Angeles. Not long after, Keener told her superior of her aspirations for acting and she landed a one-worded role as a waitress in About Last Night... (1986). Two years later, she landed a role in a film called Survival Quest (1988), where she met her future husband, Dermot Mulroney. After struggling for years in the industry, Keener landed a role in an independent film, opposite the unknown Brad Pitt, in Johnny Suede (1991). Her ascent in independent film began as she starred in Living in Oblivion (1995) and Walking and Talking (1996) before her mainstream break with Being John Malkovich (1999) in 1999, which earned Keener her first Oscar nomination.

She is of Czech (from her maternal grandmother) and English descent. After graduating from high school, Leachman attended Illinois State University and Northwestern University, where she majored in drama. After winning the title of Miss Chicago 1946 (as part of the Miss America pageant), she acted with the Des Moines Playhouse before moving to New York. Leachman made her credited debut in 1948 in an episode of The Ford Theatre Hour (1948) and appeared in many television anthologies and series before becoming a regular on The Bob & Ray Show (1951) in 1952. Her movie debut was memorable, playing the doomed blonde femme fatale Christina Bailey in Robert Aldrich's classic noir Kiss Me Deadly (1955). Other than a role in Rod Serling's movie The Rack (1956) in support of Paul Newman, Leachman remained a television actress throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, appearing in only two movies during the latter decade, The Chapman Report (1962) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Though she would win an Oscar for Peter Bogdanovich's adaptation of Larry McMurtry's The Last Picture Show (1971) and appear in three Mel Brooks movies, it was in television that her career remained and her famed was assured in the 1970s and into the second decade of the new millennium. Leachman was nominated five times for an Emmy Award playing Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary Tyler Moore's landlady and self-described best friend on Mary Tyler Moore (1970) and on the spin-off series Phyllis (1975). She won twice as Best Supporting Actress in a comedy for her \"Mary Tyler Moore\" gig and won a Golden Globe Award as a leading performer in comedy for \"Phyllis\", but her first Emmy Award came in the category Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in 1973 for the television movie A Brand New Life (1973). She also won two Emmy Awards as a supporting player for Malcolm in the Middle (2000). She was married to director-producer George Englund from 1953 to 1979.
