A charismatic priest, Father Flynn, is trying to upend the school's strict customs, which have long been fiercely guarded by Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the iron-gloved Principal who believes in the power of fear-based discipline. The winds of political change are sweeping through the community, and indeed, the school has just accepted its first black student, Donald Miller. But when Sister James, a hopeful innocent, shares with Sister Aloysius her guilt-inducing suspicion that Father Flynn is paying too much personal attention to Donald, Sister Aloysius sets off on a personal crusade to unearth the truth and to expunge Flynn from the school. Now, without a shard of proof besides her moral certainty, Sister Aloysius locks into a battle of wills with Father Flynn which threatens to tear apart the community with irrevocable consequences.","simplePlot":"A Catholic school principal questions a priest's ambiguous relationship with a troubled young student.","actors":[{"actorName":"Meryl Streep","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000658","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Mjk5MDExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1MTMyMw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 June 1949","placeOfBirth":" Summit, New Jersey, USA","birthName":"Mary Louise Streep","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Considered by many critics to be the greatest living actress, Meryl Streep has been nominated for the Academy Award an astonishing 20 times, and has won it three times. Meryl was born Mary Louise Streep in 1949 in Summit, New Jersey, to Mary Wolf (Wilkinson), a commercial artist, and Harry William Streep, Jr., a pharmaceutical executive. Her father was of German and Swiss-German descent, and her mother had English, Irish, and German ancestry. Meryl's early performing ambitions leaned toward the opera. She became interested in acting while a student at Vassar and upon graduation she enrolled in the Yale School of Drama. She gave an outstanding performance in her first film role, Julia (1977), and the next year she was nominated for her first Oscar for her role in The Deer Hunter (1978). She went on to win the Academy Award for her performances in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Sophie's Choice (1982), in which she gave a heart-wrenching portrayal of an inmate mother in a Nazi death camp. A perfectionist in her craft and meticulous and painstaking in her preparation for her roles, Meryl turned out a string of highly acclaimed performances over the next decade in great films like Silkwood (1983); Out of Africa (1985); Ironweed (1987); and A Cry in the Dark (1988). Her career declined slightly in the early 1990s as a result of her inability to find suitable parts, but she shot back to the top in 1995 with her performance as Clint Eastwood's married lover in The Bridges of Madison County (1995) and as the prodigal daughter in Marvin's Room (1996). In 1998 she made her first venture into the area of producing, and was the executive producer for the moving ...First Do No Harm (1997). A realist when she talks about her future years in film, she remarked that \"...no matter what happens, my work will stand...\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Mjk5MDExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000658","name":"Meryl Streep","idIMDB":"nm0000658"},"actorId":"nm0000658","character":"Sister Aloysius Beauvier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0109763","main":true},{"actorName":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000450","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NTA1NTg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxNzgxNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 July 1967","placeOfBirth":" Fairport, New York, USA","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Film and stage actor and theater director Philip Seymour Hoffman was born in the Rochester, New York, suburb of Fairport on July 23, 1967. He was the son of Marilyn (Loucks), a lawyer and judge, and Gordon Stowell Hoffman, a Xerox employee, and was mostly of German, Irish, English and Dutch ancestry. After becoming involved in high school theatrics, he attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, graduating with a B.F.A. degree in Drama in 1989. He made his feature film debut in the indie production Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole (1991) as Phil Hoffman, and his first role in a major release came the next year in My New Gun (1992). While he had supporting roles in some other major productions like Scent of a Woman (1992) and Twister (1996), his breakthrough role came in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997). He quickly became an icon of indie cinema, establishing a reputation as one of the screen's finest actors, in a variety of supporting and second leads in indie and major features, including Todd Solondz's Happiness (1998), Flawless (1999), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999), Almost Famous (2000) and Séquences et conséquences (2000). He also appeared in supporting roles in such mainstream, big-budget features as Dragon rouge (2002), Cold Mountain (2003) and Mission: Impossible III (2006). Hoffman was also quite active on the stage. On Broadway, he has earned two Tony nominations, as Best Actor (Play) in 2000 for a revival of Sam Shepard's \"True West\" and as Best Actor (Featured Role - Play) in 2003 for a revival of Eugene O'Neill (I)'s \"Long Day's Journey into Night\". His other acting credits in the New York theater include \"The Seagull\" (directed by Mike Nichols for The New York Shakespeare Festival), \"Defying Gravity\", \"The Merchant of Venice\" (directed by Peter Sellars), \"Shopping and F*@%ing\" and \"The Author's Voice\" (Drama Desk nomination). He is the Co-Artistic Director of the LAByrinth Theater Company in New York, for which he directed \"Our Lady of 121st Street\" by Stephen Adly Guirgis. He also has directed \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Jesus Hopped the A Train\" by Guirgis for LAByrinth, and \"The Glory of Living\" by Rebecca Gilman at the Manhattan Class Company. Hoffman consolidated his reputation as one of the finest actors under the age of 40 with his turn in the title role of Capote (2005), for which he won the Los Angeles Film Critics Award as Best Actor. In 2006, he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar for the same role. On February 2, 2014, Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in an apartment in Greenwich village, New York. Investigators found Hoffman with a syringe in his arm and two open envelopes of heroin next to him. Mr. Hoffman was long known to struggle with addiction. In 2006, he said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that he had given up drugs and alcohol many years earlier, when he was age 22. In 2013, he checked into a rehabilitation program for about 10 days after a reliance on prescription pills resulted in his briefly turning again to heroin.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NTA1NTg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxNzgxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000450","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","nicknames":["Phil"],"idIMDB":"nm0000450"},"actorId":"nm0000450","character":"Father Brendan Flynn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0114352","main":true},{"actorName":"Amy Adams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010736","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjExMjI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc0MjY2OQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 August 1974","placeOfBirth":" Vicenza, Veneto, Italy","birthName":"Amy Lou Adams","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Amy Lou Adams was born in Vicenza, Veneto, Italy, to American parents, Kathryn (Hicken) and Richard Kent Adams, a U.S. serviceman who was stationed at Caserma Ederle in Italy at the time. She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry. Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as \"Brigadoon\" and \"A Chorus Line\". It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work. Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Belles à mourir (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Cruel Intentions (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"Kathryn Merteuil\". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, Dr. Vegas (2004). Her role in the low-budget independent film Junebug (2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of \"Giselle\" in the animated/live-action feature film, Enchanted (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Adams next appeared in the major production, Charlie Wilson's War (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Sunshine Cleaning (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as \"Sister James\" in Doubt (2008) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as Amelia Earhart in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in Julie & Julia (2009). In the early 2010s, she starred with Jason Segel in The Muppets (2011), with Philip Seymour Hoffman in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012), and alongside Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in Trouble with the Curve (2012). She played reporter Lois Lane in Man of Steel (2013) and con artist Sydney Prosser in American Hustle (2013), before portraying real-life artist Margaret Keane in Tim Burton's biopic Big Eyes (2014). In 2016, she reprised her role as Lane in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and headlined Denis Villeneuve's science fiction drama Arrival (2016) and Tom Ford's dark thriller Nocturnal Animals (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjExMjI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc0MjY2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010736","name":"Amy Adams","idIMDB":"nm0010736"},"actorId":"nm0010736","character":"Sister James","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0056604","main":true},{"actorName":"Viola Davis","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0205626","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjYwMzI0NDY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU4MDk1NjE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"11 August 1965","placeOfBirth":" Saint Matthews, South Carolina, USA","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Actress Viola Davis was born on her grandmother's farm, at the then-Singleton Plantation in St. Matthews, South Carolina.
