He has one younger brother, Connor Hutcherson. From the age of four, Josh knew that he wanted to be an actor. In order to pursue his goal, Josh and his family moved to Los Angeles when he was nine-years-old. In 2002, Josh landed his first acting role in the TV film, House Blend (2002), with Amy Yasbeck, Dan Cortese and Sean Faris. The same year, Josh was cast in the pilot, Becoming Glen (2002), but Fox did not order it to series (though, several years later, it was reconfigured as the short-lived series, The Winner (2007), starring Rob Corddry, and co-written/produced by Seth MacFarlane). Toward the end of 2002, Josh appeared on an episode of ER (1994). Josh made his big-screen debut, in 2003, with a bit part in the Oscar-nominated American Splendor (2003). His career began its measured ascent in 2005 with a supporting slot as one of Will Ferrell's kids in Kicking & Screaming (2005), a co-starring role in the indie hit Little Manhattan (2005), and another co-starring role in Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), which was originally conceived as a sequel to Jumanji (1995). Despite underperforming at the box office, \"Zathura\" helped earned for Josh his first Young Artist Award for \"Leading Young Actor\". 2006 saw bigger returns for Josh's burgeoning film career with a role as one of Robin Williams' sons in the modest hit, RV (2006). The following year, he landed his first breakthrough role in Bridge to Terabithia (2007), the kid-approved adaptation of Katherine Paterson's novel that co-starred AnnaSophia Robb, whose career was also taking off at this time. Josh starred as Brendan Fraser's nephew in another family-film hit, Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008), and he had a smaller role in the Crash-like drama, Fragments (2008), though by now his face and name were being used in movie-marketing materials. Though it wasn't a hit, Josh's character in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant (2009) served as a major plot device early in the story. In 2010, Josh co-starred in the critically-acclaimed film, The Kids Are All Right (2010), alongside Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, and Mia Wasikowska. The film received several awards and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Josh's performance as the youngest child in a family, led by two mothers, earned him acclaim from audiences and the industry, alike. Josh followed up with an expanded role in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012), which saw Dwayne Johnson take over as the main character from Brendan Fraser. Between the star power and the allure of 3D, the sequel was a worldwide hit and a third installment is in development. With the announcement that he would portray the beloved \"Peeta Mellark\" in The Hunger Games (2012), the film adaptation of the best-selling novel written by Suzanne Collins, Josh became an instant celebrity. In the wake of the movie's massive worldwide success, Detention (2011), a horror/comedy that Josh made before \"The Hunger Games\", was released. Josh was also an executive producer on that feature. Before Josh reprises his role as \"Peeta\" in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), we will see him in the long-delayed remake of Red Dawn (2012); the omnibus 7 jours à la Havane (2012) (aka \"7 Days in Havana\") (Josh's segment was directed by Benicio Del Toro); The Forger (2012) opposite Lauren Bacall, Alfred Molina, and Hayden Panettiere; and the animated Epic (2013) from Ice Age (2002) co-director (and voice of \"Scrat\"), Chris Wedge.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4OTk0MjQ1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE3NjM3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1242688","name":"Josh Hutcherson","nicknames":["JHutch","Hutch"],"idIMDB":"nm1242688"},"actorId":"nm1242688","character":"Gabe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0051070","main":true},{"actorName":"Charlie Ray","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1659579","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMwOGJiN2QtNWYwZi00ZTk3LWIxM2ItNGZjOTk2NDJlYzVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxNzg3MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 March 1992","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Charlotte Ray Rosenberg","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Charlie Ray was born and raised in New York City.

But stardom is something else altogether, and it remained elusive, at least until 1999 and his appearance on NBC's acclaimed political drama, The West Wing (1999). Bradley Whitford was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to Genevieve Smith Whitford, a poet and writer, and George Van Norman Whitford. He studied theater and English literature at Wesleyan University and earned a master's degree in theater from the prestigious Juilliard Theater Center. Whitford's first professional performance was in the off-Broadway production of \"Curse of the Starving Class,\" with Kathy Bates. He also starred in the Broadway production of \"The West Wing\" creator Aaron Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men.\" His additional theater credits include \"Three Days of Rain\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club, \"Measure for Measure\" at the Lincoln Center, and the title role in \"Coriolanus\" at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. Some of Whitford's most memorable performances include roles in such films as The Muse (1999) with Albert Brooks and Bicentennial Man (1999) with Robin Williams. He has also appeared in Scent of a Woman (1992), A Perfect World (1993), Philadelphia (1993), The Client (1994), My Life (1993), Red Corner (1997), Presumed Innocent (1990), and My Fellow Americans (1996). He also had a prominent supporting part in the horror thriller Get Out (2017), as a suspicious suburban father.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NTIzNjc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjgxNTA2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925966","name":"Bradley Whitford","nicknames":["Brad"],"idIMDB":"nm0925966"},"actorId":"nm0925966","character":"Adam","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0051073","main":true},{"actorName":"Cynthia Nixon","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633223","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNzgxMDU4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3MTU5MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 April 1966","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Cynthia Ellen Nixon","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Cynthia Nixon was born in New York City on April 9, 1966, to Anne Elizabeth Knoll, an actress, and Walter E.
