His family moved to Germany in the early seventies. He lived in Berlin for most of his childhood. His younger brother is famed composer Christian Biegai. Marius spent his college years in Ulm, where he obtained a major in Theatre from the \" Theaterakademie Spielstatt Ulm\". After college he worked in theatre & television in Munich and Berlin. He soon moved to New York looking for new artistic experiences. Once he was there, he joined the \"Artaban Theatre Company\" (Theatre du Soleil a. Robert Gourp), he also worked and taught several acting workshops & joined director Gene Frankel's prestigious acting Master Class, where he met Mexican actor - choreographer Veronica Falcón. On August 1998, they got married in a simple ceremony in Mexico City. They moved to Berlin that same year & founded together \"Creactors & Co.\" a bilingual Theatre - Performance Company. While living in Germany, Marius worked mostly in television & theater. By the year 2000, they decided to relocate back to Mexico City. Once in Mexico, Marius could not work as much while he was learning Spanish, for obvious reasons. So, therefore he only did commercial work, playing non speaking parts and yet, he soon became the most sought after actor in advertisement. At one point he had 10 commercials running simultaneously. That was unheard of in the advertisement world, but Mr. Biegai has a chameleonic ability as an actor that allowed him to pull it off. As soon as he became fluent Spanish, roles started pouring in. He worked non stop in television, film & theatre. His resume as an actor includes: dozens of shorts, more than twenty-five films, over forty television shows & several stage productions in Mexico & abroad. His breakthrough performance in film was, when he played the role of Sasha Boginski in the Box Office Hit Saving Private Perez (2011), the film was directed by Beto Gomez & established Marius within the Mexican Film Industry. In Television he became a star, when he played El Menona, audiences fell in love with his interpretation of this naif child-like character & loved his comedic timing. Los Héroes del Norte (2010) became a huge hit. To this day, the show is considered, the most successful comedy series ever produced in Mexico. While working on the 2nd season of Los Héroes del Norte (2010), Mr. Biegai did something very few actors back there, had done then or since. He became the first and only actor to simultaneously play two leading roles (an antagonist & a protagonist) & air at the same time. He played the iconic villain \"Hiram Alos\", a neo Nazi Dr., one of the most terrifying characters ever to be seen in a Hispanic television show. Dr. Hiram Alos, the character was introduced on the 3rd season of the hit HBO dramatic series Capadocia (2008). At the same time Marius was still playing The Menona. It was unheard of producers allowing an actor to do that, working for two different networks, in two different shows that were on air at the same time. It was unprecedented. Audiences accepted him & loved him in both roles. Few actors can accomplish that in television.That's a testament to Mr. Biegai's astounding range, charisma & talent. Along with his cast mates, Mr. Biegai won twice (2012 & 2013) the Mexican equivalent of the People's Choice Award (The TV Novela Award) as part of the Best Ensemble Cast on a TV comedy series, for their work in Los Héroes del Norte (2010). Marius was at a time, the most successful foreign actor working in Mexico & he is a creative force behind many productions. His credits include several projects as producer, director & creative consultant. He's worked in advertisement, film, theater, opera & television. He has performed in ten different languages & he is fluent in German, Polish, French, Spanish & English. In 2014 Mr. Biegai moved to Los Angeles, where he lives his wife actor, Veronica Falcón Queen of the South (2016) & their only son.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzIxMjI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg4MTc1OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1226963","name":"Marius Biegai","nicknames":["Mako"],"idIMDB":"nm1226963"},"actorId":"nm1226963","character":"Bundesgrenzchutz","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Karl Friedrich","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294914","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 May 1929","placeOfBirth":" Graz, Austria","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Karl Friedrich was born on May 7, 1929 in Graz, Austria.
