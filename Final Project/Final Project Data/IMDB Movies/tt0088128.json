His parents are Mercedes Hall, an actress-blues and jazz singer, and Larry Hall, who owned an auto body shop. His stepfather is a show-business manager. His sister, Mary Christian, is also a performer. He has Irish and Italian ancestry. Hall's given name was Michael Anthony Thomas Charles Hall, but he adopted the Anthony Michael moniker upon finding that another Michael Hall was already a member of the Screen Actors' Guild. Hall began acting in commercials at the age of seven, and his breakthrough role was as Rusty Griswold in National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) alongside Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Following the success of National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Hall entered the defining period of his career, starring in three John Hughes classics: Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985) and Weird Science (1985). Wanting to avoid being typecast, Hall turned down roles in two subsequent 1986 Hughes films, Pretty in Pink (1986) and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). His early television credits include the Emmy Award-winning \"The Gold Bug\", in which he played the young Edgar Allan Poe, as well as the TV movie Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn (1982), and specials \"The Body Human\" and \"Orphans, Waifs and Wards\". On stage, he appeared in the Lincoln Center Festival's production of \"St. Joan of the Microphone\". Following a one-year stint on Saturday Night Live (1975), excessive drinking and partying threatened to sidetrack Hall's career. However, he was able to regain control and has been sober since 1990, the year he played the role of Jim in Edward Scissorhands (1990). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, he starred as Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in the television movie Pirates of Silicon Valley (1999). Since that time, Hall has focused on television work, including an 81-episode run on Stephen King's The Dead Zone (2002), but has managed to take on film projects as well, including the role of Mike Engel in The Dark Knight (2008). In addition to acting, Hall has also pursued his musical talents, as songwriter and lead singer of his band, Hall of Mirrors, which was formed in 1998. Hall helps at-risk youth via the Anthony Michael Hall Literacy Club and lives in Los Angeles, Caifornia.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MjM2MjAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2NjQwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001309","name":"Anthony Michael Hall","idIMDB":"nm0001309"},"actorId":"nm0001309","character":"Farmer Ted","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0074468","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Dooley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233209","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0MTczMTYwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk4MzIzOA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 February 1928","placeOfBirth":" Parkersburg, West Virginia, USA","birthName":"Paul Brown","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Dooley was a keen cartoonist as a youth and drew a strip for a local paper in Parkersburg, West Virginia.

After attending Wellesley College, she took her mother's surname and made her television debut in the miniseries Holocaust (1978), for which she won an Emmy Award. Baker made her movie debut in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979), an A-List production featuring Alan Alda at the height of his popularity and another \"Holocaust\" co-star at the start of her career, Meryl Streep. She then appeared as the Holy Mother in the TV movie, Mary and Joseph: A Story of Faith (1979). Then came \"Lolita.\" In 1980-81, the 24-year-old Baker originated the role of the preteen \"nymphet\" loved by a pedophile in Edward Albee's stage adaption of Nabokov's classic novel. The show was picketed during out-of-town tryouts and in New York by feminists outraged by the show's depiction of pedophilia. More importantly, the show was pilloried by outraged critics in its out-of-town tryouts, giving \"Lolita\" a bad word of mouth. After 31 previews, the troubled production opened on Broadway on March 19, 1981 and closed after only 12 performances. She never appeared on Broadway again, despite critics calling her performance \"breathtaking\" and \"beguiling.\" Blanche Baker has continued to work steadily in television and on the silver screen but has never again approached the heights she did in her early twenties.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5MDg0Mjk4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkzNjk2NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048273","name":"Blanche Baker","idIMDB":"nm0048273"},"actorId":"nm0048273","character":"Ginny","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013816","main":true},{"actorName":"Edward Andrews","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0028647","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNzQ2OTY2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk3MjYwOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 October 1914","placeOfBirth":" Griffin, Georgia, USA","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"The son of a Georgia minister, Edward Andrews debuted on stage in 1926 at age 12 and by 1935 had landed on Broadway.

Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John's siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago's Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall's geek brigade in Sixteen Candles (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like The Sure Thing (1985) and Better Off Dead... (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything... (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in The Grifters (1990). The next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins' Actors' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack's high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime's first feature was the sharply written comedy Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film's financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack's next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case. Cusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby's popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he's so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He's also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn't reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTAwMjYzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIxNTU1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000131","name":"John Cusack","nicknames":["Johnny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000131"},"actorId":"nm0000131","character":"Bryce","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0071078","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0088128","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088128","business":{"budget":{"money":"$6,500,000","country":null,"day":null,"month":null,"year":null,"remarks":"estimated"},"openingWeekend":[{"money":"$4,461,520","country":"USA","day":"06","month":"05","year":"1984","remarks":"1,240 Screens"}],"gross":[],"weekendGross":[{"money":"$668,170","country":"USA","day":"17","month":"06","year":"1984","remarks":"622 Screens"},{"money":"$764,925","country":"USA","day":"10","month":"06","year":"1984","remarks":"525 Screens"},{"money":"$1,291,472","country":"USA","day":"03","month":"06","year":"1984","remarks":"728 Screens"},{"money":"$2,891,806","country":"USA","day":"28","month":"05","year":"1984","remarks":"974 Screens"},{"money":"$2,688,730","country":"USA","day":"20","month":"05","year":"1984","remarks":"1,111 Screens"},{"money":"$3,199,650","country":"USA","day":"13","month":"05","year":"1984","remarks":"1,245 Screens"}],"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":[null,null],"copyrightHolder":"Universal City Studios, Inc."},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 33 min (93 min)"],"soundMix":["Mono"],"color":["Color (Technicolor)"],"aspectRatio":["1.85 : 1"],"camera":["Panaflex Camera and Lenses by Panavision"],"laboratory":["Technicolor, Hollywood (CA), USA"],"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":["Spherical"],"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"7.2","metascore":"61","filmingLocations":[{"location":"1423 Sycamore Lane, Northbrook, Illinois, USA"}],"rated":"PG","awards":[{"award":"Casting Society of America, USA 1985","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Nominated Artios","categories":[{"category":"Best Casting for Feature Film","names":[{"name":"Jackie Burch","id":"nm0120799","role":null}]}]}]},{"award":"Young Artist Awards 1985","titlesAwards":[{"titleAwardOutcome":"Won Young Artist Award","categories":[{"category":"Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical, Comedy, Adventure or Drama","names":[{"name":"Molly Ringwald","id":"nm0000208","role":null}]},{"category":"Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical, Comedy, Adventure or Drama","names":[{"name":"Anthony Michael Hall","id":"nm0001309","role":null}]}]}]}],"votes":"79,290","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0079774","name":"Channel Productions"},{"idCompany":"co0005073","name":"Universal Pictures"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["brother sister relationship","high school","crush","birthday","exchange student","looking at the camera","dental braces","pizza","two word title","1980s","female frontal nudity","shower","high school dance","teenage girl","wedding veil","wedding ceremony gone awry","bridal veil","person in a car trunk","underwear","underage sex","shower room","school bus","night vision goggles","grandfather","forgotten birthday","female nudity","father daughter relationship","convertible","church","breaking the fourth wall","party","nerd","geek","class differences","number in title","dork","high school student","16th birthday","16 year old","16 year old girl","teen movie","teen comedy","cult film","breasts","suburb","lifting someone into the air","child drives a car","dental headgear","porsche","record player","beer","coors beer","directorial debut","female removes her clothes","rolls royce convertible","muscle relaxant","birthday cake","wedding dress","lingerie","yellow panties","white panties","dream girl","asian stereotype","shy girl","wild party","teenage boy","family relationships","drunkenness","chin up","unrequited love","veil","first date","teen romance","teen angst","teenager","self discovery","marriage","first love","dysfunctional family","panties","drive in restaurant","car hop","underage drinking","sister sister relationship","restroom","restaurant","photograph","mother daughter relationship","loss of virginity","japanese","illinois","houseguest","grandmother","future in laws","farce","ethnic slur","coming of age","car accident","title based on song","gay slur","wedding","jock","brat pack"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/12 06:02:05"}}
