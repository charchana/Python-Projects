His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside (1967), The Virginian (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Witness (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope. On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition. Ford suffered a broken pelvis and broken ankle during the accident, as well as other injuries.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4Mjg0NjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM2NTI3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148","name":"Harrison Ford","nicknames":["Harry"],"idIMDB":"nm0000148"},"actorId":"nm0000148","character":"Indiana Jones","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001063","main":true},{"actorName":"Sean Connery","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwNTM4MzctYjQzMi00NTA2LTljYWItNTYzNmE1MTYxN2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"25 August 1930","placeOfBirth":" Edinburgh, Scotland, UK","birthName":"Thomas Sean Connery","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Sean Connery is best known for portraying the character James Bond, starring in seven Bond films between 1962 and 1983. In 1988, Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables (1987). His film career also includes such films as Marnie (1964), The Name of the Rose (1986), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Highlander (1986), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), DragonHeart (1996) and The Rock (1996). Connery has been polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted \"Sexiest Man of the Century\". Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Euphemia McBain (née McLean), was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He has a brother, Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves. No Road Back (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it followed by several Tv-movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) and guest appearances on TV-series, and also films such as Hell Drivers (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), The Frightened City (1961). In 1962 he appeared in The Longest Day (1962) with a host of other stars. Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. He played the character in the first five Bond films: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), and You Only Live Twice (1967) - then appeared again as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, \"He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks\", and \"I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man,\" adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2\", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming's girlfriend told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No (1962) premiere. He was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels. Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film. During the filming of Thunderball (1965), Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately. Connery was forced to wear a toupee during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 17. This didn't prevent Connery from being cast in roles, although it became more noticeable in his later years. In 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled From Russia with Love (2005), which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast. After and during the success of the Bond-films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander (1986), The Name of the Rose (1986), The Untouchables (1987) (which earned him an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Rising Sun (1993), The Rock (1996), Finding Forrester (2000), and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963, he followed in his father's footsteps and also became an actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, they have no children together. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and his ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Quinn Connery, in 1997.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwNTM4MzctYjQzMi00NTA2LTljYWItNTYzNmE1MTYxN2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125","name":"Sean Connery","nicknames":["Big Tam"],"idIMDB":"nm0000125"},"actorId":"nm0000125","character":"Professor Henry Jones","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001064","main":true},{"actorName":"Denholm Elliott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001186","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2ODQ3NDc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAwMjg5Nw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 May 1922","placeOfBirth":" Ealing, London, England, UK","birthName":"Denholm Mitchell Elliott","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Much-loved character actor who specialised in playing slightly sleazy/slightly eccentric and often flawed upper middle class English gentlemen.

She is the youngest of three children. She was educated in a convent, where she gained a passion for the arts. She later studied at the National College of Fine Arts in Dublin, but left because she lacked the motivation and thought she would take a year off to think it out. Meanwhile, while sitting in a café with friends, she was approached by a still photographer who asked her if she would be interested to model. Thinking she could use the pocket money, she said yes. Modeling proved to be both fun and lucrative, and very soon she did it professionally. Her modeling contracts led to commercial work, which would take her around the world. One day, a casting director saw her work and suggested she try acting instead. She was sent to London at age 19, where she quickly won an audition to appear in the new James Bond film, A View to a Kill (1985). She so loved acting that she pursued a career in that direction. After her first film, she shot a few TV dramas in London and in Dublin, but her big break came when she was cast as Aryan seductress Dr. Elsa Schneider in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Apparently she made a huge impression on Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who loved her great sense of humor and her Grace Kelly looks. After Indiana Jones, which introduced her to Hollywood and to the United States, she was chosen to replace Cybill Shepherd as spokeswoman for L'Oréal. After that she shot a few B-movies in the United States, but at one point felt she missed Ireland too much, so she went back to Dublin. In 1994, she put her career on hold to spend more time with media heir Gavin O'Reilly, whom she had been dating for two years. In 1996 they married, and later had two children. In 2002, she was asked to cameo in the 'Michael Caine (I)_ comedy The Actors (2003), and there she regained a lust for the movie industry. The following summer, she shot Allan Quatermain et la pierre des ancêtres (2004) with co-star Patrick Swayze, and it's then that the whole ball started rolling again. In 2005, she and her husband divorced and she decided to re-launch her stalled career, but she quickly realized how difficult it was to break into this kind of business for a second time, especially after ten years away from the camera. Recently she appeared in the short film Benjamin's Struggle (2005), directed by newcomer Jamie Breese, and played a role in the well-known British series Waking the Dead (2000). In a recent interview, she said she was thrilled to be acting again, but added that she wasn't willing to accept anything for the sake of working. She is determined to find the right part, but she also wants to do different things: \"I'm fed up playing the nasty Nazi. I'd like to do something quite extreme.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5NjI5MTExM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUxNDczMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0233145","name":"Alison Doody","idIMDB":"nm0233145"},"actorId":"nm0233145","character":"Elsa","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0001070","main":true},{"actorName":"John Rhys-Davies","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0722636","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNDY3NjQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3NTYyOQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 May 1944","placeOfBirth":" Ammanford, Wales, UK","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Acclaimed Welsh actor John Rhys-Davies was born in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, Wales, to Mary Margaretta Phyllis (Jones), a nurse, and Rhys Davies, a mechanical engineer and Colonial Officer.

His mother, Arlyn (Dunetz), a Bronx-born secretary, and his father, John Bottom, a carpenter, met in California in 1968. They worked as itinerant fruit pickers, and later joined the Children of God religious group (John was originally Catholic, while Arlyn was born Jewish). By the time River was two, they were living in South America, where John was the sect's Archbishop of Venezuela. They later left the group and, in 1977, moved back to the United States, changing their last name to \"Phoenix\". They lived with River's maternal grandparents in Florida, and later moved to Los Angeles. His parents encouraged all of their children to get into movies and, by age ten, River was acting professionally on TV. His film debut was in Explorers (1985), followed rapidly by box-office successes with Stand by Me (1986) and The Mosquito Coast (1986), and as young Indiana in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). His role as Danny Pope in Running on Empty (1988) earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His best role was probably Mike, the hustler in My Own Private Idaho (1991).

River was in the middle of filming Dark Blood (2012), playing the character Boy when he died. The film couldn't be finished due to too many unfilmed crucial scenes. His mother was later sued.
