She has been at home on center stage ever since. As a precocious and outgoing child Gina performed in all her school plays and talent shows. Through most of these early years, as she moved around with her mom and older brother, her first love was dance. Whether ballet, tap, modern, or musical theatre, Gina was immersed in dance performance. As the classical ballet training developed her unrelenting work ethic, it wasn't long before Gina's love of performance began to shape itself into something resembling a career. At the age of fifteen, Gina was scouted by a modeling agency and shipped to Japan. Embracing the move with both hands, Gina schooled herself on the culture and language and the country quickly became her second home. Professionally, Japan was a major break. Gina was unbelievably successful in modeling and appeared on upwards of twenty magazine covers. But modeling was never Gina's passion. While her talent and drive gave her a taste of success, modeling was ultimately a stepping stone to bigger things, in another medium. On returning to North America, Gina went back to school, where she continued to study Japanese and graduated from college at the top of her class. Then, while working two jobs, Gina took acting classes to develop her stage skills. It was during these years that she faced a lot of naysayers, a lot of people telling her, \"No, you can't.\" In spite of - or perhaps because of - this type of pessimism, Gina was determined to become an actor. \"Oh really? Just watch me!\" was her response. Continuously driven and fiercely independent, Gina has managed to achieve big things without buying into the trappings of show business. In a world that revolves around money, fame, and image, Gina has found success and happiness through sheer will and commitment to her craft. She also finds fulfillment volunteering with less fortunate people - Gina has worked with physically and mentally challenged and enjoys supporting bullied teen girls, helping them foster confidence and self esteem. Despite a list of personal achievements that includes starring roles in prime time TV shows and in feature films (big budget and indie), Gina continues to work hard to achieve bigger and better things. She continues to study theatre and classical ballet, and, surrounded by loving friends and family, she is always looking ahead.
