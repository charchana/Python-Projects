Making her film debut at the age of 15, her breakthrough came two years later in the very popular trilogy Sissi (1955). Her mother, supervising her daughter's career, immediately approved Romy's participation in Christine (1958), the remake of Max Ophüls's Liebelei (1933), where Magda Schneider once starred herself. During the shooting, she fell in love with her co-star Alain Delon and eventually moved with him to Paris. At that time, she started her international career collaborating with famous directors such as Luchino Visconti and Orson Welles. After Delon had broken up with her in 1964, she married Harry Meyen shortly after. Although she gave birth to a boy, David-Christopher, their relationship was difficult, so they divorced in 1975. Being unsatisfied with her personal life, she turned to alcohol and drugs, but her cinematic career -especially in France- remained intact. She was the first actress, receiving the new created César Award as \"Best Actress\" for her role in That Most Important Thing: Love (1975). Three years later, she was awarded again for A Simple Story (1978). After a short marriage to her former secretary Daniel Biasini, being the father of her daughter Sarah Biasini, she suffered the hardest blow of her life when her son was impaled on a fence in 1981. She never managed to recover from this loss and died on 29 May 1982 in Paris. Although it was suggested she committed suicide caused by an overdose of sleeping pills, she was declared to have died from cardiac arrest.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NDI2NzA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM1OTQyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002769","name":"Romy Schneider","nicknames":["Puppele"],"idIMDB":"nm0002769"},"actorId":"nm0002769","character":"Constanze","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Magda Schneider","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003579","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI5ZDM4ZWItMmRiNy00ZWIwLWIxOWEtMGVmNDM2ZmVhYTJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 May 1909","placeOfBirth":" Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany","birthName":"Magdalena Schneider","bio":"Magda Schneider was born on 17 May 1909 in Augsburg, Germany and a singer, stage and film actress.

After her film debut Boycott (1930), she was type casted as the simple girl, dreaming of a happy life in movies such as Two in a Car (1932) or Ein Mädel wirbelt durch die Welt (1934). In 1933, she got to know Wolf Albach-Retty, whom she married four years later. Their children Rosemarie (aka Romy Schneider) and Wolf-Dieter were born in 1938 and 1941, but they divorced in 1945. After World War II, she appeared on stage and screen again, but was better known as ambitious mother, who urged on the career of her daughter Romy. In the 1950s, she played her mother or aunt in several movies such as When the White Lilacs Bloom Again (1953) or Sissi (1955). In the last years of her life, she had to bear the death of her grandson David in 1981 and her daughter Romy in 1982.
