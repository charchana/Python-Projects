On a whim she buys the derelict Windmill theatre in the West End and persuades impresario Vivian Van Damm to run it, despite the fact the two don't seem to get on at all. Although their idea of a non-stop revue is at first a success, other theatres copy it and disaster looms. Laura suggests they put nudes in the show, but Van Damm points out that the Lord Chamberlain, who licenses live shows in Britain, is likely to have something to say about this. Luckily Mrs Henderson is friends with him.","simplePlot":"Laura Henderson buys an old London theater and opens it up as the Windmill, a performance hall which goes down in history for, among other things, its all-nude revues.","actors":[{"actorName":"Judi Dench","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001132","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI5NjQ4NDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc5OTczNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 December 1934","placeOfBirth":" York, North Yorkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Judith Olivia Dench","height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Judi Dench was born in York, England, to Eleanora Olive (Jones), who was from Dublin, Ireland, and Reginald Arthur Dench, a doctor from Dorset, England.

He is the son of Elsie Lillian (Hopkins), a nursery school teacher and cook, and Robert William Hoskins, Sr., who drove a lorry and worked as a bookkeeper. Growing up, Hoskins received only limited education and he left school at 15, but with a passion for language and literature instilled by his former English teacher. A regular theatre-goer, Hoskins dreamed of starring on stage, but before he could do so he had to work odd jobs for a long time to make ends meet. His acting career started out more by accident than by design, when he accompanied a friend to watch some auditions, only to be confused for one of the people auditioning, getting a script pushed into his hands with the message \"You're next\". He got the part and acquired an agent. After some stage success, he expanded to television with roles in television series such as Villains (1972) and Thick as Thieves (1974). In the mid-'70s, he started his film career, standing out when he performed alongside Richard Dreyfuss in John Byrum's Inserts (1975) and in a smaller part in Richard Lester's Royal Flash (1975). Hoskins broke through in 1978 in Dennis Potter's mini TV series, Pennies from Heaven (1978), playing \"Arthur Parker\", the doomed salesman. After this, a string of high-profile and successful films followed, starting with his true major movie debut in 1980's The Long Good Friday (1980) as the ultimately doomed \"Harold Shand\". This was followed by such works as The Cotton Club (1984), Mona Lisa (1986), which won him an Oscar nomination as well as a BAFTA award, Cannes Film Festival and Golden Globe), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) (Golden Globe nomination), Mermaids (1990), Hook (1991), Nixon (1995), Le voyage de Felicia (1999) and Enemy at the Gates (2001). Hoskins always carefully balanced the riches of Hollywood with the labor of independent film, though leaned more towards the latter than the former. He worked at smaller projects such as Shane Meadows' debut 24 7: Twenty Four Seven (1997), in which he starred as \"Allen Darcy\". Besides this, he found time to direct, write and star in The Raggedy Rawney (1988), as well as direct and star in Rainbow (1995), and contributing to HBO's Tales from the Crypt (1989) and Tube Tales (1999). Suffering from Parkinson's disease in later years, Hoskins died of pneumonia at age 71 in a London hospital.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTE0ODQyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIyNTk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001364","name":"Bob Hoskins","nicknames":["The Cockney Cagney"],"idIMDB":"nm0001364"},"actorId":"nm0001364","character":"Vivian Van Damm","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020585","main":true},{"actorName":"Will Young","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1094099","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyOTkxMTA5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjcwMTA1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 January 1979","placeOfBirth":" Wokingham, Berkshire, England, UK","birthName":"William Robert Young","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Has a twin brother called Rupert and an older sister, Emma.

His mother, Jean Pauline (Hindes), was a vice president of casting at CBS. His father, Peter Haden-Guest, was a UN diplomat who was a member of the British House of Lords, and was the fourth Baron of Saling in the County of Essex. Christopher's mother, who was American, was the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants. Christopher's father, who was British, had English and Dutch-Jewish ancestry. Christopher's paternal great-grandfather, Colonel Albert Goldsmid, was a British officer. He received his dramatic arts training at New York City's High School of Arts and Music and at Bard College, and Guest first appeared in minor film roles in a mixture of film genres including The Hot Rock (1972), Death Wish (1974), Lemmings (1973), and The Long Riders (1980). However, he was also dabbling in writing for several T.V. shows, and when filming Million Dollar Infield (1982), Guest became acquainted with writer-director Rob Reiner and the two collaborated, along with Michael McKean and Harry Shearer, to pen the script and music for the sleeper hit This Is Spinal Tap (1984). The mockumentary also starred Guest as dizzy lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, whose most famous line is surely, \"These go to eleven,\" when referring to the volume settings on the band's rather unique Marshall amplifiers! Guest then busied himself for several years in the 1980's as a regular performer on Saturday Night Live (1975) and, along with fellow Spinal Tap band members lead singer David St. Hubbins, aka Michael McKean; and bassist Derek Smalls, aka Harry Shearer, they regularly appeared as Spinal Tap. In 1992, they released Spinal Tap: Break Like the Wind - The Videos (1992), plus A Spinal Tap Reunion: The 25th Anniversary London Sell-Out (1992). Guest had a minor acting role in the courtroom drama of A Few Good Men (1992), before returning to poke fun at wannabe actors in the howlingly funny Waiting for Guffman (1996) with Guest taking center stage as high-strung choreographer Corky St. Clair. He made a return to heavy metal with Spinal Tap: The Final Tour (1998) and Catching Up with Marty DiBergi (2000) before turning his comedic pen to the world of championship dog shows for the sensational comedy Best in Show (2000). The latest mockumentary from Guest and co-writer-actor Eugene Levy was again met with critical praise, and movie fans just loved it, too! In 2003, Guest and Eugene Levy took aim at the folk-music world, and successfully collaborated to write the comedy A Mighty Wind (2003) about the reunion of the Folksmen, a fictional 1960s folk music group. Guest is married to well-known actress Jamie Lee Curtis with two children, Annie Guest and Thomas, plus he is the brother of actor Nicholas Guest.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NzU2MjMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzQwMDMz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001302","name":"Christopher Guest","idIMDB":"nm0001302"},"actorId":"nm0001302","character":"Lord Cromer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020584","main":true},{"actorName":"Kelly Reilly","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0717709","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjgzMzk2MjEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkzMDEwMTE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 July 1977","placeOfBirth":" Surrey, England, UK","birthName":"Jessica Kelly Siobhán Reilly","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Kelly Reilly was born on July 18, 1977 in Surrey, England as Jessica Kelly Siobhán Reilly.

Thelma Barlow was born in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the younger of two daughters. Her father, Tommy, a cabinet maker, died of pneumonia five weeks before her birth, and Barlow was brought up by her mother Margaret. During her childhood the family moved to Huddersfield, West Riding of Yorkshire. Barlow left school at 15 and went to Huddersfield Technical College to study shorthand and typing. Her first job was as a secretary, which she held for eight years and at the same time belonged to an amateur dramatics group. Barlow decided to take up acting professionally and joined the Joan Littlewood Theatre Group. During the 1950s she did rep in Liverpool, Nottingham and Birmingham. In 1960 Barlow joined the West of England Theatre Company followed by the Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company. In Bristol she ran a boarding house for fellow actors. In 1956 she married set designer Graham Barlow; they subsequently had two children, Clive and James. They divorced in 1983. Thelma Barlow's first television appearance was in 1970's A Stranger on the Hill. The following year while performing in Liverpool she was asked to audition for the soap opera Coronation Street for the role of Mavis Riley. She was successful and her first episode was transmitted on 14 August 1971, though the character appeared regularly only from 1973, when she joined the staff of \"The Kabin\". Barlow remained in the series for 26 years, appearing in nearly 2,000 episodes, until she left after the departure of her on-screen husband Derek. Her final episode was broadcast 10 October 1997 when Mavis moved to the Lake District. During her time on Coronation Street Barlow shared a flat with co-star Helen Worth and later moved to Settle, where she later did a TV show from her garden. Barlow's next major role was that of Dolly Bellfield in Victoria Wood's sitcom Dinnerladies, which ran for two series from 1998 to 2000. Since her departure from Coronation Street Barlow has also made stage appearances. In June 2014, Barlow narrated 30-minute documentary \"Gail & Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street\" which celebrated Helen Worth's career on Coronation Street as Gail Platt.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0055289","name":"Thelma Barlow","idIMDB":"nm0055289"},"actorId":"nm0055289","character":"Lady Conway","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0020586","main":true},{"actorName":"Anna Brewster","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1116106","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2Mzk2NTE3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ1NjMyMjE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 January 1986","placeOfBirth":" Birmingham, England, UK","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Anna Brewster was born on January 1, 1986 in Birmingham, England.
