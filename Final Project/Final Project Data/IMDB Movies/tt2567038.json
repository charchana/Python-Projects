1970","placeOfBirth":" Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","birthName":"Marty Mariani","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"The earliest years of Marty's life were spent in Salt Lake City, Utah until, at the age of 14, he and his family moved to Arvada, Colorado. A product of Pomona High School, Marty continued his studies at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado. While in college, Marty's athletic pursuits quickly took a back seat to his newly discovered passion for acting. He furthered his theater studies at Metro State College and started performing in a variety of theatrical settings throughout the Denver/Boulder area. Marty's love of acting took him to Los Angeles in 1996 where he studied with Ivana Chubbock and Christina Pickles and was featured on several television series and in a multitude of independent films. Marty busted out in the bizarro comedy, \"God Made Man,\" where he played Lovester the psychotic but affable donut delivery man for which he received the Audience Award for Best Performance at the 2000 MicroCineFest in Baltimore, Maryland. Appearances in everything from \"NYPD Blue\" and \"Passions\" to the film noire, \"Suspects in the Murder of Miss May\" further illustrate Marty's versatility in front of the camera. When Marty is not acting, he writes. His writing credits include \"Four Corners\" (play - 2001 - Hudson Theater in Los Angeles) \"Durango\" (TV pilot) and \"For Ben's Sake\" (screenplay). Marty served as the Managing Director of his own production company, Prospector Productions, through which he produced a handful of plays, short films, and one documentary. A singer, songwriter and guitar player, Marty scored most of his own music in the last short film he produced, \"Actual Size\". In his most recent feature film, \"The Zodiac\" (starring opposite Philip Baker Hall, Justin Chambers, Rory Culkin and Robin Tunney), Marty played the elusive Zodiac Killer. \"The Zodiac\" was released by ThinkFilm and Myriad Pictures on limited screens throughout the United States in March 2006, with the nationwide DVD launch in August 2006, and availability through subscription services, HBO, Cinemax and Starz, in early 2007. Marty's performance received acclaim from industry experts and Zodiac aficionados alike. Since returning to Colorado in 2004, Marty has been featured in several independent films, commercials and live shows including contributions as a writer and actor in the Zoom-In Showcase in January 2006. Marty's latest completed work is the screenplay entitled \"Suburban,\" in which Marty will also take on the role of Daniel Gold and provide his feature film directorial debut. \"Suburban\" is a production of Fruition Films, LLC, a company launched by Marty and the Producer of \"Suburban\" in early 2007. Since 2007 Marty has racked up number of credits, including the critically acclaimed \"Ink\" which premiered at The Santa Barbara Film Festival. The enormously hilarious \"Race Walkers\" played at several film festivals throughout the US and won for Best Feature at The Festivus Film Festival. \"The One Who Loves You\" is currently (2014) on the festival circuit and is garnering critical attention by festival programmers. Marty just wrapped \"The Lost Boy\" which played at The Stanley Film Festival in Estes Park, CO.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MDQ5ODA1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MjA1MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512386","name":"Marty Lindsey","idIMDB":"nm0512386"},"actorId":"nm0512386","character":"The Pharmacist","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Luke Seven","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1455839","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzY5OTM1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAxMjY2NzE@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Back in the 1980s, while President Ronald Reagan was reviving the economy and the success of the Brat Pack was booming, a young boy by the name of Luke Seven (known as Seven) was riding his Honda minibike in the backyard of his parent's house in Littleton, Colorado. Disregarded by adults, Seven and his older brother Robby would find their refuge in a sport and an art form that would transform their lives for years to come. At the time, George Lucas was the biggest name around. Movies like American Graffiti (1973) and Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) would impact the boys in ways they never thought possible. Robby began emulating Lucas with his 8mm camera, while Seven would find his inspiration from a nontraditional group of men, the Honda factory riders of the era. Together the boys spent endless hours letting their souls express through the magic of movie making and dirt bikes. In his youth, Seven credits certain events that created an everlasting imprint on his psyche. The unforgettable 1984 and 1985 Carlsbad Grand Prix captured the essence of glory and helped the brothers redefine their definition of victory. David Bailey, Ron Lechien and Danny Chandler (Team Honda 1984) uplifted their spirits as they watched those infamous motos on ABC's Wide World of Sports. Seven's self esteem would not be molded by parents or teachers, but by the men who wore white gear, raced red motorcycles and earned the title factory rider. By the late 80s, Luke Seven and his brother Robby had made the transition from 8mm film to state-of-the-art VHS. School ranked a solid 4th place behind movies, motocross and cars. The boys shot one short film after another often including their dirt bikes in their films. It was later during their teenage years that Seven would discover his brother's dark dependency on alcohol. Ironically, it was an addiction that also haunted Seven's favorite actor, Patrick Swayze. Sadly in their 20s, the two siblings would go in separate directions. Seven's parents openly encouraged his brother's movie making, while steering him in a more traditional academic direction, a family decision that brought resentment between the two brothers. While in college, Luke Seven was fascinated by what made people tick and studied sociology and politics. After graduating from the University of Northern Colorado, the young entrepreneur entered real estate and politics. In 2000, after losing an election for the Colorado House of Representatives, Seven vowed to return to acting and filmmaking. In 2003, the brothers reconciled their differences and worked together to complete the award winning short film, Honor and Defeat (2003). Robby would go on to direct numerous short films, while Seven moved to California to craft his filmmaking. While living in Los Angeles, Seven was educated by two major Hollywood heavyweights. Marc Scott Zicree, writer and producer of Sliders and Deep Space Nine, fine tuned his writing and producing talents, while Dov S-S Simens (Hollywood Film Institute) shaped his business and directing skills. With a resume that spans well over a decade, Luke Seven highlights several jobs with gratitude. When the actor appeared in a McDonald's commercial, it gave him the reassurance that he was capable of performing in large scale advertisements. Companies like Hyatt Regency, Furniture Row, and Swedish Match embraced the entertainer and placed him in their print advertisements. His last national television appearance was in 2015 in a commercial for Edward Jones. However, nothing outshines the recognition he received in the movie, The Westminster Wife Show. A role that he credits for starting his friendship with writer Joey Curtis (Blue Valentine (2010) ). In 2011, Seven's darkest chapter would arrive when his brother would pay the ultimate price for his alcohol addiction. While bedridden and surrounded by family, Robby's health deteriorated due to cirrhosis of the liver. The brother's last conversation consisted of movies and motocross. On his death bed, the paling director referenced riding motocross again, just like Ronnie Lechien. An unforgettable remark that implied time spent in the afterlife. In the early morning of July 29, 2011, Robert Cabrera died immediately after watching his favorite movie, American Graffiti. Today, Luke Seven continues his saga as an actor, writer and filmmaker. As the owner of Father Sky Films, he is dedicated to producing heartfelt dramas that touch hearts and transform lives.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzY5OTM1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAxMjY2NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1455839","name":"Luke Seven","idIMDB":"nm1455839"},"actorId":"nm1455839","character":"Alfredo","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Shon Joaquin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2127662","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Shon Joaquin is an actor, known for The Frame (2014), Orthogenesis (2005) and The Shadow Walkers (2006).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2127662","name":"Shon Joaquin","idIMDB":"nm2127662"},"actorId":"nm2127662","character":"Moi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jose Guerrero","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6681743","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Jose Guerrero is an actor, known for The Frame (2014).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6681743","name":"Jose Guerrero","idIMDB":"nm6681743"},"actorId":"nm6681743","character":"Ferr","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Rafael Hernández","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3175171","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEyMzU0OTQ5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQxOTE5MzE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Rafael Hernández is an actor, known for The Burning Plain (2008), In the Deathroom (2009) and Easy Money (2008).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEyMzU0OTQ5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQxOTE5MzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3175171","name":"Rafael Hernández","idIMDB":"nm3175171"},"actorId":"nm3175171","character":"Rafael","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt2567038","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2567038","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["2 hr 7 min (127 min)"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":["Sony F55"],"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":["4K"],"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"6.7","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Denver, Colorado, USA"}],"awards":[],"votes":"1,975","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0160720","name":"Double Edge Films"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["author powers"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 03:31:47"}}
