She is of English, Welsh, Irish, and Scottish descent. Rachel became involved with acting as a teenager and by the age of 13 was performing in Shakespearean productions in summer theater camp; she went on to graduate with honors with a BFA degree in Theater from York University. After her debut in an episode of Disney's Jett Jackson (1998), she co-starred in the Canadian TV series Slings and Arrows (2003), a comedy-drama about the trials and travails of a Shakespearean theater group, and won a Gemini award for her performance in 2003. Her breakout role as Regina George in the hit comedy Mean Girls (2004) instantly catapulted her onto the short list of Hollywood's hottest young actresses. She followed that film with a star turn opposite Ryan Gosling in the adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks bestseller The Notebook (2004), which was a surprise box office success and became the predominant romantic drama for a new, young generation of moviegoers. After filming, McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved and dated through mid-2007. McAdams next showcased her versatility onscreen with the manic comedy Wedding Crashers (2005), the thriller Red Eye (2005), and the holiday drama The Family Stone (2005). McAdams then explored the independent film world with Married Life (2007), which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and also starred Pierce Brosnan, Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson. Starring roles in the military drama The Lucky Ones (2008), the newspaper thriller State of Play (2009), and the romance The Time Traveler's Wife (2009) followed before she starred opposite Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law in Guy Ritchie's international blockbuster Sherlock Holmes (2009).

She was born Katherine Mathilda Swinton on November 5, 1960, in London, England. Her mother, Judith Balfour, Lady Swinton (née Killen), was Australian, and her father, Major-General Sir John Swinton, an army officer, was English-born. Her ancestry is Scottish, Northern Irish, and English, including a long tapestry of prominent Scottish ancestors. Born into a patrician military family, she was educated at an English and a Scottish boarding school. Tilda subsequently studied Social and Political Science at Cambridge University and graduated in 1983 with a degree in English Literature. During her time as a student, she performed countless stage productions and proceeded to work for a season in the Royal Shakespeare Company. A decided rebel when it came to the arts, she left the company after a year as her approach shifted dramatically: With a taste for the unique and bizarre, she found some genuinely interesting gender-bending roles come her way, such as the composer Mozart in Pushkin's \"Mozart and Salieri\", and as a working class woman impersonating her dead husband during World War II, in Karges' Screenplay: Man to Man: Another Night of Rubbish on the Telly (1992). In 1985 the pale-skinned, carrot-topped actress began a professional association with gay experimental director Derek Jarman. She continued to live and work with Jarman for the next nine years, developing seven critically acclaimed films. Their alliance would produce stark turns, such as turner-prize nominated Caravaggio (1986), The Last of England (1987), The Garden (1990), Edward II (1991), and Wittgenstein (1993). Jarman succumbed to complications from AIDS in 1994. His untimely demise left a devastating void in Tilda's life for quite some time. Her most notable performance of that period however comes from a non-Jarman film: For the title role in Orlando (1992), her nobleman character lives for 400 years while changing sex from man to woman. The film, which Swinton spent years helping writer/director Sally Potter develop and finance, continues to this day to have a worldwide devoted fan following. Over the years she has preferred art to celebrity, opening herself to experimental projects with new and untried directors and mediums, delving into the worlds of installation art and cutting-edge fashion. Consistently off-centered roles in Female Perversions (1996), Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998), Teknolust (2002), Young Adam (2003), Broken Flowers (2005) and Béla Tarr's L'homme de Londres (2007) have only added to her mystique. Hollywood too has picked up on this notoriety and, since the birth of her twins in 1997, she has successfully moved between the deep-left-field art-house and quality Hollywood blockbusters. The thriller The Deep End (2001), earned her a number of critic's awards and her first Golden Globe nomination. Such mainstream U.S. pictures as The Beach (2000) with Leonardo DiCaprio, fantasy epic Constantine (2005) with Keanu Reeves, her Oscar-decorated performance in Michael Clayton (2007) alongside George Clooney and of course her iconic White Witch in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) have cemented her place as one of cinema's most outstanding women. She then starred in the crime drama Julia (2008); in David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008); learned Italian and Russian for Luca Guadagnino's Amore (2009); starred in the psychological thriller We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011); in Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom (2012); in Joon-ho Bong's Snowpiercer - le transperceneige (2013) and in Terry Gilliam's The Zero Theorem (2013). Swinton later starred in the dark romantic fantasy drama, Only Lovers Left Alive (2013) directed by Jim Jarmusch and had a small role in Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). In 2015, Swinton starred in Judd Apatow's comedy Crazy Amy (2015), and played a Rock star in Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), starring opposite Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes. In 2016, she starred in Joel & Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar! (2016). Swinton has been confirmed in Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria (2017), a remake of Dario Argento's 1977 film.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NzMzMTkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU4MDg1Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842770","name":"Tilda Swinton","nicknames":["Swilda"],"idIMDB":"nm0842770"},"actorId":"nm0842770","character":"The Ancient One","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0046738","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Stuhlbarg","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836121","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcwMjA2MDMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU1NzE4Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 July 1968","placeOfBirth":" Long Beach, California, USA","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Michael Stuhlbarg was born on July 5, 1968 in Long Beach, California, USA.

Along with his elder brother Craig, he was raised by their parents, John and Janet (Sanders) Adkins, in a loving middle-class family. Scott attended Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. Probably not the best of students, he used to sneak downstairs after his parents had gone to bed and watch films all night then fall asleep during lessons. A natural athlete, Scott enjoyed a variety of sports as he grew up, but when he was 10 years old, he accompanied his father and brother to the local Judo club. The attraction was instantaneous. Idolising stars such as Bruce Lee and Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott began to train everyday. He took over his Dad's garage and turned it into his own Dojo. He even had a shrine to Bruce Lee in there that he would bow to. He remembers being mugged on a bus when he was around 13 and that really kicked his training into overdrive. He wasn't ever going to let that happen again. At the age of 14, Scott went on to train in Tae Kwon Do under the instruction of Ron Sergiew with the T.A.G.B. After a few years, he moved on to Kickboxing under Anthony Jones. He is now a fully trained Kickboxing Instructor for the P.K.A. A self confessed \"film junkie\" Scott's attention was drawn to acting through the Hollywood Greats. He enrolled in a drama class at Sutton Coldfield College. Being a shy lad he initially found it difficult to be put on stage in front of an audience. Finally, at the age of 21, Scott was offered a place at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. However, as an impoverished student, he found it hard to make ends meet without a grant and was forced to leave without completing the course. Very dejected he thought that was the end. His first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial arts film called Dei seung chui keung (2001) (aka Extreme Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and director Wei Tung and English-born Hong Kong movie expert Bey Logan, Adkins found himself in the East for the first time. Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema's leading action directors including Woo-Ping Yuen, Corey Yuen, Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and the legendary Jackie Chan. Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in BBC's Doctors (2000) filmed at Birmingham's Pebble Mill. A few episodes in BBC's EastEnders (1985) and City Central (1998), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama Mile High (2003) followed by a regular role in BBC's Holby City (1999) as Bradley Hume, the assistant General Manager of Holby General. Starring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of Talbot in Special Forces (2003) and Yuri Boyka\" in Undisputed 2: Last Man Standing (2006). It was this film that broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka in what has been hailed as one of the best American made Martial Arts films of recent times. Along with lead actor Michael Jai White, fight coordinator J.J. Perry and the slick direction of Isaac Florentine this movie has some unbelievably heart stopping fight scenes. After this Scott has had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and The Tournament (2009), and played Jean-Claude Van Damme's main adversary in Sony Pictures The Shepherd (2008).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTQxMjMxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1NzM0MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0012078","name":"Scott Adkins","idIMDB":"nm0012078"},"actorId":"nm0012078","character":"Lucian","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0551979","main":true},{"actorName":"Zara Phythian","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2333360","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZmNWUyOWMtNDQ5Mi00Y2Y4LTk5NTgtZTMyMDA0NDkzMThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA2OTEwNA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Zara Phythian is known for her work on He Who Dares (2014), The Hike (2011) and Underground (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZmNWUyOWMtNDQ5Mi00Y2Y4LTk5NTgtZTMyMDA0NDkzMThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA2OTEwNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2333360","name":"Zara Phythian","idIMDB":"nm2333360"},"actorId":"nm2333360","character":"Brunette Zealot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alaa Safi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2349733","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMTE1NDAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMzc0MDI@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 September 1984","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","height":"5' 9¾\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Alaa Safi was born and raised in France, to Moroccan parents.

His diversified yet young experience got him to face his childhood's hero in a duel. He is cast as Jackie Chan's antagonist in \"Chinese Zodiac 12\", his last direction that won the 2013 Hong-Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography. He then plays The Moorish Prince in \"Outcast\" alongside Nicolas Cage and Hayden Christensen. More recently, he won the Best Male Actor Award for his performance in \"Taureau Taureau\", and multiplied his appearances in prestigious productions like \"Doctor Strange\", \"American Assassin\", \"Tyrant\", \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and \"The Mummy\".","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMTE1NDAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMzc0MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2349733","name":"Alaa Safi","idIMDB":"nm2349733"},"actorId":"nm2349733","character":"Tall Zealot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Katrina Durden","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7167836","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MjQ4MTcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNDM0MDI@._V1_UY44_CR11,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Katrina Durden is known for her work on Doctor Strange (2016) and Street Fighter: Resurrection (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MjQ4MTcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNDM0MDI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7167836","name":"Katrina Durden","idIMDB":"nm7167836"},"actorId":"nm7167836","character":"Blonde Zealot","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Topo Wresniwiro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8508973","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Topo Wresniwiro is an actor, known for Doctor Strange (2016) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8508973","name":"Topo Wresniwiro","idIMDB":"nm8508973"},"actorId":"nm8508973","character":"Hamir","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0554377","main":true},{"actorName":"Umit Ulgen","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3203072","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgxNzEyNjQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI1MTM2MDE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Umit Ulgen was born in Turkey.
