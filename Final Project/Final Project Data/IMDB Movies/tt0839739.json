Little Edie, in her 50s, who wears scarves and bright colors, sings, mugs for the camera, and talks to Al and David Maysles, the filmmakers. Big Edie, in her 70s, recites poetry, comments on her daughter's behavior, and sings \"If I Loved You\" in fine voice. She talks in short sentences; her daughter in volumes. The film is episodic: friends visit, there's a small fire in the house, Little Edie goes to the shore and swims. She talks about the Catholic Church. She's ashamed that local authorities raided the house because of all the cats. She values being different.","simplePlot":"Utilizing hours of unseen archival footage, The Beales is a new take on the women of Grey Gardens.","actors":[{"actorName":"Edith 'Little Edie' Bouvier Beale","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1799073","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkwNTI2MDA1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMyMjM5Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR16,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 November 1917","placeOfBirth":" Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 9½\" (1.77 m)","bio":"Edith 'Little Edie' Bouvier Beale was born on November 7, 1917 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA.
