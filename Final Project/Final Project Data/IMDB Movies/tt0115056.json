She was discovered by Jing Wong, who cast her in many of his productions in the early 1990s. After appearing in God of Gamblers (1989), Cheung was propelled to stardom for her role in the Stephen Chow smash hit All for the Winner (1990). She soon became a highly popular Hong Kong actress and immediately found herself working almost non-stop. \"All for the Winner\" also launched Stephen Chow's career, and the two were subsequently paired in many early 90's comedies, in which Cheung usually starred as Chow's love interest. Her pairings with Stephen Chow were huge box office hits such as God of Gamblers II (1991), the Fight Back to School (1991) trilogy, Royal Tramp (1992), and King of Beggars (1992). They teamed up for about 10 films, however their collaboration came to an end in 1994 with Gau ban ji ma goon ji baak min bau ching tin (1994). Another frequent co-star was Andy Lau, alongside whom she appeared in such films as God of Gamblers (1989), God of Gamblers II (1991), Dances with Dragon (1991), the Lee Rock (1991) trilogy, and Handsome Siblings (1992). Cheung is known for the many fantasy/martial arts films she's starred in, that include several adaptations of Louis Cha's novels, such as King Hu's The Swordsman (1990) (as Ren Yingying, the beautiful Sacred Maiden of the Sun-Moon Sect), Royal Tramp (1992) (as the Divine Lady of the Dragon Sect posing as the Empress Dowager), Kung Fu Cult Master (1993) (opposite Jet Li, as a beautiful and mysterious Mongolian princess), The Sword Stained with Royal Blood (1993) (opposite Biao Yuen, as a princess posing as a thief), Fei hu wai zhuan (1993) (alongside Leon Lai), and Xin tian long ba bu zhi tian shan tong lao (1994) (as a semi-godess, alongside Brigitte Lin and Li Gong). Other notable roles include Holy Weapon (1993) (as a spider ninja, along with Michelle Yeoh and Maggie Cheung), Flying Dagger (1993) (as 'Tony Leung Ka Fai''s rival), Legend of the Liquid Sword (1993) (along with Aaron Kwok), and the \"Wong Fei Hung\" serial's parody Last Hero in China (1993) (as Jet Li's love interest). After an impressive body of work in the early 1990s (she starred in about 50 films between 1990 and 1995), Sharla Cheung moved into producing in 1995 with Yi qian ling yi ye zhi meng zhong ren (1995), which starred 'Tony Leung Ka Fai' and Chien-Lien Wu. However, she was unhappy with it and remade the film as Romantic Dream (1995). The films were commercial failures, and Cheung subsequently retired from the film industry to focus on various business interests. In the early 2000s, Cheung made a comeback in acting with The Two Individual Package Women (2003), a modern urban drama about women facing difficult romantic choices. She also turned to television and portrayed Diao Chan, one of the Four Beauties of ancient China in Diao Chan (2002), opposite Ray Lui. She subsequently starred in such TV shows as Legend of the Book's Tower (2005) alongside Nicky Wu, and Fan fu da yuan (2006) along with Honglei Sun.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0156522","name":"Sharla Cheung","idIMDB":"nm0156522"},"actorId":"nm0156522","character":"Mandy Tan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Chi-Shing Chan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3288001","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Chi-Shing Chan is an actor and assistant director, known for City on Fire (1987), The God of Cookery (1996) and Shanghai Express (1986).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3288001","name":"Chi-Shing Chan","idIMDB":"nm3288001"},"actorId":"nm3288001","character":"Wedding Guest","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Joe Cheng","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155577","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Joe Cheng is an actor, known for Too Many Ways to Be No. 1 (1997), Sixty Million Dollar Man (1995) and Wu Yen (2001).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155577","name":"Joe Cheng","idIMDB":"nm0155577"},"actorId":"nm0155577","character":"God of Cars","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lawrence Cheng","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155593","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 December 1954","placeOfBirth":" Hong Kong","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Lawrence Cheng was born on December 28, 1954 in Hong Kong.
