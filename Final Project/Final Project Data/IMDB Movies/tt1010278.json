Anna moved to her mother's native country when she was four years old. Her first acting job ever was at age nine in the film La leçon de piano (1993), which she ended up being cast in because it was shot in New Zealand. At age 16, she relocated to Los Angeles where she completed her last two years of high school (graduating in 2000). She then moved to New York where she attended Columbia University for one year. Between 2001 and 2004 she worked almost exclusively on stage in both New York and London.

Her mother, Beverly (Bushfield), was a homemaker, and her father, Thad Harold Harden, was in the military. The family relocated often -- she first became interested in the theater when the family was living in Greece, and she had attended plays in Athens. Harden began her college education at American universities in Europe and returned to the US to complete her studies at the University of Texas in 1983; went on to earn an MFA at NYU, and, thereafter, embarked on her acting career. Although she had acted in a movie as early as 1986, in the little-known The Imagemaker (1986), her first mainstream role, coming alongside some TV movie work, was as a sultry femme fatale in the Coen Brothers' cleverly offbeat homage to the gangster movie, Miller's Crossing (1990). Harden received good reviews for her sultry performance as Verna, a seductive, trouble-making moll. Harden thereafter worked steadily in supporting roles, including the portrayal of Ava Gardner in Sinatra (1992), a television biopic about Frank Sinatra. Harden also worked in the theater and, in 1993, was part of the Broadway cast of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America\", playing Harper, the alienated wife of a closeted gay man. It was a demanding dramatic role, and Harden won acclaim for her work, including a Tony award nomination. She returned to movie making in the mid-1990s, continuing to turn in superb supporting performances in films and television. Harden's road to success was a long one, her work generally being overlooked because the productions were either critically panned or ignored by audiences. However, it was just a matter of time before Harden got a chance to truly show her quality on-screen, and that time came in 2000, with Ed Harris's Pollock (2000), in which she played Lee Krasner, artist and long-suffering wife of Jackson Pollock. Harden's performance was deeply moving and unforgettable and earned her the Oscar and New York Film Critic's Circle awards for best supporting actress. Continuing to work prolifically in features and television, she earned another Oscar nomination in 2003 for her supporting role in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), Harden having earlier worked with Eastwood in 2000's Space Cowboys (2000). Harden's work often makes otherwise mediocre productions worth watching, fully inhabiting any character she portrays. She married Thaddaeus Scheel, with whom she worked on The Spitfire Grill (1996), in 1996 and the couple have three children, a daughter Eulala Scheel and twins Julitta and Hudson.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5Njg2ODgyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkzMjQ3OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001315","name":"Marcia Gay Harden","idIMDB":"nm0001315"},"actorId":"nm0001315","character":"Janina Krzyzanowska","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Goran Visnjic","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0899681","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk1ODI0Nzc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQzNDczNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 September 1972","placeOfBirth":" Sibenik, Croatia, Yugoslavia","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"Goran Visnjic is a Croatian American actor and producer, born in Sibenik, Croatia, Yugoslavia.

The son of Sir Peter Parker and Dr. Jill Parker, he decided at the age of nine that acting would be his career of choice. His first public performances were with the National Youth Theatre, a breeding ground for many British actors. After attending The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA), Nathaniel became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). Before exiting the stage for the screen, Nathaniel portrayed \"Bassanio\" in The Merchant Of Venice, participating in both the London and Broadway productions. The production was directed by the critically acclaimed Sir Peter Hall and starred Dustin Hoffman. His first feature film, War Requiem (1989), was directed by the highly acclaimed British maverick Derek Jarman, and starred Tilda Swinton and Lord Laurence Olivier. Nathaniel is perhaps best known for his participation in period dramas such as the part of \"Laertes\" in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990), \"Rochester\" in Wide Sargasso Sea (1993) and \"Cassio\" in his brother Oliver Parker's version of Othello (1995), starring Laurence Fishburne. He also appeared in the Chris Farley comedy Beverly Hills Ninja (1997) and the Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston box office hit, The Bodyguard (1992). Parts in projects such as Into Thin Air: Death on Everest (1997) and David (1997) helped Nathaniel gain momentum in the world of television, but it was roles like \"Rawdon Crawley\" in Vanity Fair (1998) and \"Gabriel Oak\" in Far from the Madding Crowd (1998) that thrust him into the spotlight and solidified his career on the small screen. Currently, Nathaniel portrays \"Detective Thomas Lynley\" in the BBC series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries (2001). Now in its third season, the show has become an international success, earning rave reviews the world over. Returning to Hollywood in 2003, Nathaniel can be seen in cinemas soon, portraying \"Master Edward Gracey\" in Walt Disney Pictures The Haunted Mansion (2003), starring Eddie Murphy.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5ODMyMDEyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkwMTcyMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662511","name":"Nathaniel Parker","nicknames":["Nat"],"idIMDB":"nm0662511"},"actorId":"nm0662511","character":"Dr. Majkowski","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Steve Speirs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0818648","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NDc4NjEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU1NjA3MDE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"22 February 1965","placeOfBirth":" Troedyrhiw, near Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, UK","birthName":"Steven Roberts","bio":"Steve Speirs was born on February 22, 1965 in Troedyrhiw, near Merthyr Tydfil, Wales as Steven Roberts.

He originally worked first in advertising and then he trained as a teacher, while he participated in amateur dramatics as a pastime. As a professional actor he gained extensive experience performing in repertory in England and Scotland and landed small roles at the Royal Court Theatre. He is also a founding member of the Joint Stock Theatre Company. He acted at the National Theatre and began to get roles on British television. Films included The Long Good Friday (1980) (starring Bob Hoskins) and The Dogs of War (1980) (starring Christopher Walken). His work was noticed by American director Steven Spielberg, who cast Freeman as French archaeologist Rene Belloq, Harrison Ford's charismatic but utterly selfish rival in the blockbuster Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). He had expected to appear in the next Indiana Jones movie, but Spielberg and George Lucas decided on a different story. Nevertheless, his portrayal of Belloq guaranteed him good work in the following years, during which he continued to showcase his command of dialects and chameleonlike ability to disappear into roles, such as the deliciously evil Professor Moriarty in the Michael Caine comedy, Without a Clue (1988). His notable television appearances have included Will Shakespeare (1978), Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), Falcon Crest (1981), Inspector Morse (1987), and ER (1994). He has also continued to work as a stage actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4Mzc2NjU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYzMDAxMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293550","name":"Paul Freeman","idIMDB":"nm0293550"},"actorId":"nm0293550","character":"Monsignor Godlewski","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michelle Dockery","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1890784","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5ODEwMTk0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzI5NTcxMDI@._V1_UY44_CR8,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 December 1981","placeOfBirth":" Barking, Essex, England, UK","birthName":"Michelle Suzanne Dockery","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Michelle Suzanne Dockery born 15 December 1981 is an English actress and singer.
