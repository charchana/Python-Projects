After graduating from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida in 1986, Cornell had a small guest appearance in a 1988 episode of Thirtysomething (1987). The same year, she played an assertive reporter in the Oscar-nominated comedy movie Married to the Mob (1988). Cornell's best-known role also came about in 1988 when she auditioned for parts in two horror films: lead girl Alice Johnson in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988) and Rachel Carruthers, foster sister of Jamie Lloyd, in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988), winning the latter. Halloween 4 grossed over three times its budget and Cornell reprised her role as Rachel in its sequel, Halloween 5 (1989). After appearing in episodes of TV shows ABC Afterschool Specials (1972) and Gabriel's Fire (1990), as well as the made-for-television movie Chips, the War Dog (1990), Cornell was set to appear in the comedy A League of Their Own (1992), but had to drop out after finding out she was pregnant. After an eight-year break from the film industry, Cornell returned to executive produce and act in Free Enterprise (1998) and The Specials (2000). She played tough cop Jordan Casper in the critically-panned, video game-based zombie movie House of the Dead (2003) and its sequel, House of the Dead 2 (2005), and appeared in five more horror films in 2005 and 2006. Moreover, Cornell was in the pilot episode of The Event (2010) and played a detective in four episodes of the short-lived Femme Fatales (2011); she also tried a hand at directing Prank (2008) with Halloween 4 and 5 co-star Danielle Harris and horror actress Heather Langenkamp, which fell through, and was interviewed in the documentary Halloween: 25 Years of Terror (2006).

He is of German and Irish descent. Richard attended the University of Notre Dame, where he became heavily involved with the University Theatre. Appearing in such productions as \"Luther\", \"Antigone\", \"Rhinoceros\", \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\", he also took on the task of stage manager on many of these productions, and it was not unusual to find him helping to build the sets or manage the costumes during this period. Graduating with a B.A. (cum laude) in 1970, Richard traveled to Salzburg and Innsbruck to study German, a language in which he is fluent. Progressing to Academy of Dramatic Art in Rochester, Michigan, Richard has had extensive experience as a stage actor, as well as teaching acting, and made his Broadway debut in 1986 with \"Execution of Justice\". One of his major triumphs in the theatre has been alongside Kevin Spacey in the acclaimed 1999 revival of O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\", in which he played the drunken, corrupt ex-cop Pat McGloin. Brief appearances in Rooster Cogburn, The Duchess and Dirtwater Fox, Joy Ride, and Twice in a Lifetime, as well as in such TV fare as Escape From Hell (1977), Joe Kennedy: The Forgotten Kennedy (1977), and the NBC series \"Hot Pursuit\" (1984) have disguised an expanding repertory theatre portfolio. Richard has also contributed to such diverse undertakings as Bay Area Radio's Eugene O'Neill Project (playing Smithers to Joe Morton's Brutis Jones in \"The Emperor Jones\") and the Adams-Jefferson Project of Carleton College, participating in a series of recordings of the correspondence between the two US Presidents. To this day, Richard has maintained his involvement in theatre workshops and encouraging the dramatic arts under the auspices of the Mark Taper Forum and A.S.K. However, since his scene-stealing cameo as the Quartermaster in 1989's Glory, with his trademark bushy mustache and heavyset frame, Richard has acquitted himself as one of the best, and busiest, character players on TV and in the movies.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNDgyMDcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkwNjY0MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0726223","name":"Richard Riehle","idIMDB":"nm0726223"},"actorId":"nm0726223","character":"Emilio","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cristin Michele","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1789262","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3ODk4MzAwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc2NzU2MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Cristin Michele is an actress, known for 2001 Maniacs (2005), Night of the Living Dead 3D (2006) and House of the Dead 2 (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3ODk4MzAwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc2NzU2MjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1789262","name":"Cristin Michele","idIMDB":"nm1789262"},"actorId":"nm1789262","character":"Janet","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Julian Berlin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1139554","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE3MDEyMjAyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU3MzEzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 February 1979","placeOfBirth":"","birthName":"Julie Ann Nagle","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"She is a violinist, electric and classical, and played with the St. Cloud Symphony for 3 years.
