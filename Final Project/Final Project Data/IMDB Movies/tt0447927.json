He and his sister, actress Tori Spelling, grew up in Beverly Hills, CA where he attended Montclair College Prep. Randy made his television debut in 1992 on the Fox prime time series Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990) and later held a recurring role on the popular program. Randy went on to star in the NBC series Malibu Shores (1996) and NBC's hit soap opera Sunset Beach (1997). He also guest-starred on the WB series 7th Heaven (1996). After starring for three and a half years on Sunset Beach (1997), Randy transitioned into the record business and formed his own record label called Spellbound/Vocab Records. As CEO, he oversaw operations of A&R as well as the production, promotion, marketing and distribution departments. Spellbound/Vocab Records released albums for a number of platinum artists. While continuing his work in the music business, Randy made his feature film debut in the thriller Held for Ransom (2000) (Emmet/Furla Films) opposite Dennis Hopper and Zachery Ty Bryan.

Equally skilled at comedy and drama, she has worked continuously for several decades, in critically-acclaimed projects. She was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to parents Dennis and Marie, and is the sister of actresses Vanessa Zima and Yvonne Zima. \"Zima\", a Polish surname, is her mother's maiden name; Madeline's maternal grandfather was of Polish descent, while her other ancestry is Italian, German, and Irish. She grew up in Pennsylvania and, early on, had a New York agent for modeling and commercials. She and her sister Vanessa were discovered by Woody Allen for his movie, Alice (1990). She actually quit show business, the week when she was urged to come in for her sixth call back for The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992). She came back for one more audition and booked the role of \"Emma\". She booked the movie and has never stopped working since. It was both Madeline and Julianne Moore's first film and was directed by Academy Award-winning director and writer, Curtis Hanson. Madeline won critical notice for her first film role. Madeline followed that dramatic thriller with a short film that Daryl Hannah directed. It was a Sundance favorite called The Last Supper (1995), where Madeline, as a tiny wily child, scared away her mother's abusive boyfriend by convincing him that she and her mother were cannibals. She followed that with the comedies, Mr. Nanny (1993), Our Song, a pilot with George Hamilton, and finally The Nanny (1993). On The Nanny (1993), where writing changed daily, Madeline honed her comic timing on the six-year CBS comic hit that is now a linchpin of the Lifetime daily programming. By this time, the pilot of The Nanny (1993) was picked up and Madeline moved from New York to L.A., when The Nanny (1993) became a hit show. She has starred in TV films: The Secret Path (1999). Her sister, Yvonne Zima played the seven-year-old counterpart to her characters. She played the daughter of the late John Ritter and Marg Helgenberger on Lethal Vows (1999). The Sandy Bottom Orchestra (2000) was a starring role where she learned virtuoso violin pieces, which were so impressively played, even the music consultant on the movie, thought Madeline was a professional violinist. After a worldwide search in all English-speaking countries, Madeline was the choice to play Lucille Ball as a teenager, in the CBS mini-series, Lucy (2003) (aka \"Redhead\"). She followed that up playing the wicked stepsister of Hilary Duff in A Cinderella Story (2004). Madeline took up sketch comedy-writing with hopes of one day being on SNL. In the pilot, 3 lbs. (2006), produced by Peter Ocko, she plays a violinist again, this time with a brain tumor. Reviews in Entertainment Weekly said her performance was the only reason to watch the show. In a return to television, she agreed to play the mysterious and destructive character \"Mia\" on the hit Showtime series, Californication (2007). When not working on movies, Madeline sings and plays guitar, writes songs, screenplays. She loves to snowboard, paint, dance and spends lots of time with her sisters, who are also actresses and writers, Vanessa Zima and Yvonne Zima.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MzQ0NzMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA1NzI1NTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0956526","name":"Madeline Zima","nicknames":["Mad, Maddie, Madsters"],"idIMDB":"nm0956526"},"actorId":"nm0956526","character":"Frances","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Gabrielle Carteris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0142000","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NzkxOTk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyNjY5MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 January 1961","placeOfBirth":" Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","birthName":"Gabrielle Anne Carteris","height":"5' 1\" (1.55 m)","bio":"Gabrielle Carteris was born on January 2, 1961 in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA as Gabrielle Anne Carteris.
