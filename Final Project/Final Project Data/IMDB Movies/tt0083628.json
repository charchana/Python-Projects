Blee was born on June 8, 1958 in Orange County, California and grew up in the San Francisco bay area. Debra started out as a member of the Berkeley Repertory Group, where she acted in stage productions of such plays as \"Wait Until Dark,\" \"The Tavern,\" and \"Room Service.\" She moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to pursue a full-time acting career. Debra gave a charming and vibrant performance in her film debut as the naive, uptight and virginal Sarah in the delightfully raucous and raunchy \"The Beach Girls.\" Blee went on to portray street gang member Rachel in the terrifically trashy \"Savage Streets,\" the gutsy Cynthia in the dopey martial arts romp \"Sloane,\" the sweet Mia Vunk in the hilariously stupid \"Hamburger: The Motion Picture,\" and spoiled rich girl Jane in the entertainingly silly \"The Malibu Bikini Shop.\" Outside of her regrettably sparse movie credits, Debra made a guest appearance on the \"Hooker's War\" episode of \"T.J. Hooker.\" Alas, after tackling a small part in the comedy \"Beach Fever\" Debra Blee called it a day as an actress and dropped out of the film business.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088147","name":"Debra Blee","idIMDB":"nm0088147"},"actorId":"nm0088147","character":"Sarah","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Val Kline","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0459677","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Val Kline is an actor, known for The Beach Girls (1982).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0459677","name":"Val Kline","idIMDB":"nm0459677"},"actorId":"nm0459677","character":"Ginger","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jeana Keough","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0866460","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUwNDA1MTAwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ5NDg3MjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 September 1955","placeOfBirth":" Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","birthName":"Jean Myers","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Jeana Keough was born on September 18, 1955 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA as Jean Myers.

Nine of his more than 30 films would be in motorcycle movies, sometimes at odds with young rebel Jack Nicholson before his 'Easy Rider' fame. The former Richard Jordan Gerler was destined to become some type of entertainer as his dad was a vaudeville comic and his mom a chorus girl. His parents met while performing in the Ziegfeld Follies. A former gang member living on the streets of New York, he eventually straightened up by enlisting in the Army. Following this he studied acting at the Beverly Hills Playhouse and earned a Universal contract to boot. Adam appeared on TV in all the \"hip\" 60s shows at the time such as \"The Mod Squad\" and \"Star Trek.\" His cult films include Hells Angels on Wheels (1967) with Nicholson, The Savage Seven (1968), Psych-Out (1968) again with Nicholson, Hell's Belles (1969) and Platinum Pussycat (1968) In addition, he appeared on horseback in John Wayne's western El Dorado (1967), and co-starred with Anthony Perkins in Play It As It Lays (1972), Peter Fonda in Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (1974), and Peter O'Toole in The Stunt Man (1980). Parts grew scarce in the early 80s and Adam decided to focus his attentions on teaching. In 1982 he opened the Film Actor's Lab in Dallas, Texas and settled. One of his students would be Lou Diamond Phillips of the movie La Bamba fame. Ironically, Adam's last film was a featured role in the low-budget film Sioux City (1994) starring and directed by former protégé Phillips. Adam died two years later of a heart attack in his sleep in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Euless, Texas. The 60s 'leader of the pack' prototype was survived by wife Carla.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjEzNTUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc0NDYzOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0730126","name":"Adam Roarke","idIMDB":"nm0730126"},"actorId":"nm0730126","character":"Carl Purdue","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Beans Morocco","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057885","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 June 1934","placeOfBirth":" Ohio, USA","birthName":"Daniel Ernest Barrows","bio":"Beans Morocco is a survivor of the '60s in San Francisco, where, for many years, he was a member of the improv group \"The Committee\".

She was born on September 2, 1938 in Denver, Colorado, the daughter of Robert and Cornelia (Callaghan) Catlett. A graduate of Loretto Heights College in Denver, she was drawn to acting quite young -- musical comedy, in particular. While she made her off-Broadway debut in a 1963 melodrama, \"Along Came a Spider\", which opened at the Mermaid Theatre, the following year Mary Jo was right back in her tuneful element scoring as Ernestina in the original Broadway production of \"Hello, Dolly!\" starring Carol Channing. She toured with the production when Ginger Rogers took the show on tour. Eventually building up her resume in regional theater, she served as a replacement in the 1969 musical \"Promenade\", then returned to Broadway at the end of that year where her broad, burlesque style well suited the bawdy musical takeoff of Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", which lasted about four months. Other New York-based productions came her way but most were short-lived, including \"Greenwillow\" (1970), \"Different Times\" (1972), \"Lysistrata\" (1972) and \"Fashion\" (1973). However, she did enjoy a scene-stealing role as Mabel in the New York revival of \"The Pajama Game\" in 1973. While Mary Jo has a propensity for humor and laughter, she has also demonstrated an award-winning dramatic side. Her role as Lola Delaney in \"Come Back, Little Sheba\" earned her the Los Angeles Drama Critics Award in 1976. Four years later, she won the award again in a production of \"Philadelphia, Here I Come\". Over the years, she has flitted about not only in musicals (\"Annie Get Your Gun\" (as Annie), \"How to Succeed in Business...\"), but has tackled Shakespeare (\"Twelfth Night\", \"Romeo and Juliet\") and other serious stage roles (\"27 Wagons Full of Cotton\", \"Naomi Court\", \"Our Town\"). With her plaintive and matronly features, ample size, wallflower demeanor and instincts for broad levity, Mary Jo has proven to be a natural for small screen comedy. In the late 1960s, she began to apply her trade on-camera. One of her earliest mid-career appearances included a role in the television fantasy The Littlest Angel (1969) where she and fellow comedienne Lu Leonard played plus-sized scribes, but it was not until the mid-1970s that she began making the normal rounds with dozens of appearances on the sitcom circuit, including roles on \"The Bob Newhart Show\", \"M*A*S*H\", \"Mr. Belvedere\", \"Night Court\", Gimme a Break\", \"Saved By the Bell\", \"Maude\" and \"Welcome Back, Kotter\". In 1982, she joined the cast as a housekeeping regular for television kids Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges and Dana Plato on Diff'rent Strokes (1978) and found plentiful work on lightweight dramatic series too such as \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Matlock\" and \"Fantasy Island\". In daytime, she was nominated for an Emmy Award during the 1989-1990 season of General Hospital (1972). She also became a television face in households with over 30 national commercials to her credit. Sparingly used on film, she made her debut in an unbilled part in Woody Allen's Bananas (1971). Other supporting work include roles in High Anxiety (1977), Semi-Tough (1977), The Champ (1979), The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982) and, more notably, Serial Mom (1994). She has had a slight upsurge of late in movie parts with roles in the gay-themed Surprise, Surprise (2010) and Anderson's Cross (2010), and the comedy How to Be a Serial Killer (2008). On stage, Mary Jo has continued to put her best foot forward on the musical stage in such productions as \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Big River\" and \"The Full Monty\", not to mention several variations of \"Nunsense\" and its offshoots. Her most popular and enduring voice work of late has been that of Mrs. Poppy Puff in the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants (1999). She can also be heard in its animated feature-length movie film. Over the years, Mary Jo has shown that her heart is as big as her talent as a consistently reliable and fun-filled novelty song performer at charity fund raisers and musical benefits, most notably for various AIDS and the Broadway-oriented \"Help Is on the Way\" organizations.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MDc3MDUzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg4MDYxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0146181","name":"Mary Jo Catlett","idIMDB":"nm0146181"},"actorId":"nm0146181","character":"Mrs. Brinker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Fern Fitzgerald","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0280235","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI4OTI4MDMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjA5ODEyMjE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"7 January 1947","placeOfBirth":" Valley Stream, New York, USA","bio":"Fern Fitzgerald was born on January 7, 1947 in Valley Stream, New York, USA.
