The youngest of three boys, including famous older brother (by five years) John Turturro, Nicholas Turturro was born on January 29, 1962, in Queens, New York, and grew up in its Rosedale section. He is the son of Italian-American parents, Katherine, a jazz singer, and Nicholas Turturro, a construction worker and carpenter. After attending various Catholic schools, he graduated and majored in theater at Adelphi University for two years, but left to marry Jami Biunno and help raise their child, Erica. The couple later divorced. While working as a doorman at the St. Moritz Hotel in New York City, Nick managed to find a job as both an extra and voice-over artist in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing (1989) after brother John introduced Nick to Spike. Spike took an immediate interest in the rough-edged Nick and wrote a featured role for him in his next film Mo' Better Blues (1990) in which John and Nick played repugnant Jewish brothers and co-owners of a club. Both the brothers went on to appear together again in Lee's Jungle Fever (1991) and Nick also appeared in Lee's Malcolm X (1992). Nick branched out on his own after this and earned parts in the movies Federal Hill (1994) and Excess Baggage (1997), and garnered serious TV attention as rookie detective \"James Martinez\" on NYPD Blue (1993). His character was originally created as a foil to David Caruso star character, but he lost momentum after Caruso's early departure from the show. Still, he managed to hang around for seven seasons. Very dark in tone and complexion, the compact-framed Nick certainly has had a wealth of experience in mob drama, playing a young Al Capone in one guest appearance, and assorted mobster types in other TV-movies. Plenty of guest-starring roles have also come his way with episodes of Law & Order (1990), L.A. Law (1986) and The Twilight Zone (1985) and a recurring role on Third Watch (1999). He has lightened up on a rare occasion in such comedies as The Drew Carey Show (1995) and in a couple of failed pilots. On stage, Nick has appeared in \"Wild Goose\", \"The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui\" (with John) \"Lusting After Popino's Wife\" and \"Siddown: Conversations With the Mob\". Nick's never strayed too far from the family fold. He's appeared in a number of John's projects over the years that have also occasionally featured cousin Aida Turturro (from The Sopranos (1999) fame). His mother has also appeared in a few films, as has John's wife and sons. Nick remarried a number of years ago.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNDM3NjQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYyMjc1MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878155","name":"Nicholas Turturro","idIMDB":"nm0878155"},"actorId":"nm0878155","character":"Mike Garret","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dan Lauria","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491357","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTIxOTUyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE4NTkzMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 April 1947","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York, USA","height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Dan Lauria was born on April 12, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York, USA.

Born in Sarasota, Root majored in acting and broadcasting at the University of Florida and remains a die-hard Gator fan. After three years of touring the U.S. and Canada with the National Shakespeare Company, Root settled in New York, honing his craft in many regional theaters and starring off-Broadway in 'Journey's End' and 'The Au Pair Man'. His Broadway debut came in 'So Long On Lonely Street', which was followed by the Tony award-winning production of 'All My Sons', with Richard Kiley. A starring role as 'Boolie', in the Broadway national touring company of 'Driving Miss Daisy' with Julie Harris, brought Root to Los Angeles where he now resides. Back on the boards, he recently starred with Helen Hunt and Lyle Lovett in ;Much Ado About Nothing', an LA Shakespeare Production. His first acting role on screen came in George A. Romero's cult horror classic Monkey Shines (1988). After that, many more under-the-radar supporting roles came his way until he found some moderate fame in the acclaimed series NewsRadio (1995), where he played the somewhat eccentric owner of a radio station, Jimmy James, with Dave Foley as the station manager. The show ran from 1995 to 1999. Root has played more eccentric characters in recent years, voicing several characters in the hit animated TV series King of the Hill (1997), a show created by and starring Mike Judge. Judge would later cast Root in another cult classic film, 1999's 35 heures, c'est déjà trop (1999), where Root played the squirrelly and unforgettable Milton Waddams, a man who is pushed around at work and has a fetish for Swingline staplers. More recently Root has worked with such directors as the Coen brothers and Kevin Smith creating more oddball characters as well as making guest appearances on numerous TV shows.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MDA3OTA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ4MDU0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0740535","name":"Stephen Root","idIMDB":"nm0740535"},"actorId":"nm0740535","character":"Jaan Laaman","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Dean Norris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0606487","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzOTQ2NDIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE0OTYwOQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 April 1963","placeOfBirth":" South Bend, Indiana, USA","birthName":"Dean Joseph Norris","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Dean Norris was born on April 8, 1963 in South Bend, Indiana, USA as Dean Joseph Norris.

It was there John found a passion for acting and became a Denver Broncos fan. He graduated in the mid-80s with a B.F.A. in theatre from the The Catholic University of America / Hartke Theatre Acting program. From then, he continued to work in theatre around the country, but concentrated mostly on his work at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, acting in many plays from Shakespeare to Shaw to Chekhov. In the early nineties, John was able to find time away from the theatre to work in film, as productions came through Minnesota. In 1996, he received critical acclaim for his role as Marge Gunderson's simple husband Norm Gunderson in Fargo (1996). He went on to make two more films that year, both of which were conveniently set in Minnesota, the acclaimed Beautiful Girls (1996) and Feeling Minnesota (1996). Since then, John's film career has been on an amazing climb. Much like other well respected actors from the theatre, such as John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, he chooses to play very interesting and diverse roles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODAxNjYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE1OTg5NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002253","name":"John Carroll Lynch","idIMDB":"nm0002253"},"actorId":"nm0002253","character":"The Major","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0113407","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113407","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["1 hr 30 min (90 min)"],"soundMix":["Stereo"],"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":["1.33 : 1"],"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":["35 mm"],"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":["35 mm"]},"rating":"6.0","filmingLocations":[{"location":"Minnesota, USA"}],"rated":"NOT RATED","awards":[],"votes":"135","type":"TV Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0060569","name":"Patchett Kaufman Entertainment"},{"idCompany":"co0063285","name":"World International Network (WIN)"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["fbi"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/14 07:01:58"}}
