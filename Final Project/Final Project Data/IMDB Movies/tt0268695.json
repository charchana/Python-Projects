In 1985, just two days after his final high school exam, Guy started a four-year stint as \"Mike Young\" on the popular Aussie soap Les voisins (1985).

He is the son of Barbara Anne Brereton (Sharpe) and Paul Dugan Irons, an accountant. Young Jeremy didn't prove very fond of figures. A typical islander, he used to go to mainland England only once a year. He wound up being grounded when his family settled down in Hertfordshire. At the age of 13 he enrolled in Sherborne School, Dorset, where he was happy as he could practise his favorite sport, horse-riding. Before becoming an actor, he had considered a veterinarian surgeon's career. He trained at the Bristol Old Vic School for two years, then joined Bristol Old Vic repertory company where he gained much experience working in everything from Shakespeare to contemporary dramas. He moved to London in 1971 and had a number of odd jobs before landing the role of \"John the Baptist\" in the hit musical \"Godspell\". He went on to a successful early career in the West End theatre and on TV, and debuted on-screen in Nijinsky (1980). In the early 80s, he gained international attention with his starring role in the Granada Television serial adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel Brideshead Revisited (1981), after which he was much in demand as a romantic leading man. He went on to a steady film career. In 1984, he debuted on Broadway opposite: Glenn Close in Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\" and, in the mid-80s, he appeared in three lead roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Once described as 'the thinking woman's pin up', he has made his name in thought provoking films such as David Cronenberg's Faux-semblants (1988), for which he won the New York Critics Best Actor Award. He gained a Golden Globe Award in addition to an Oscar for Best Actor in 1990 for his role as Claus von Bulow in Reversal of Fortune (1990) alongside Glenn Close. Among his many achievements, his role as Professor Higgins in Loewe-Lerner's famous musical \"My Fair Lady\" mustn't be forgotten. It was in London, back in 1987. He is married to actress Sinéad Cusack, with whom he appeared in Waterland (1992) and in the Royal Shakespeare Company plays. He appeared with his son Samuel Irons and his father-in-law Cyril Cusack in the film Roald Dahl's Danny the Champion of the World (1989). His son Max Irons is also an actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Mzg2NDY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwNzA0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000460","name":"Jeremy Irons","idIMDB":"nm0000460"},"actorId":"nm0000460","character":"Über-Morlock","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Alan Young","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949241","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MTU1NDE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQwODk1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 November 1919","placeOfBirth":" Tynemouth, Northumberland, England, UK","birthName":"Angus Young","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Alan Young was born in Northern England in 1919, but his Scots father moved the family to Edinburgh, Scotland, when Young was a toddler and then to Canada when Young was about 6 years old. As a boy, he suffered from severe asthma, which kept him bedridden for long periods of time but encouraged his love of radio. By age 13, Young had become a radio performer, and by age 17, he was writing and performing in his own radio show for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The show was broadcast in the U.S. and led to an invitation to New York, initiating Young's career as an \"All-American boy,\" despite his non-American origins and a vestigial Scots accent. He became popular on American radio from 1944 to 1949 with his \"Alan Young Radio Show,\" but when radio began to lose its popularity and his show was canceled, Young decided to put together a comedy act and tour the U.S. theater circuit. After this experience, he wrote a television pilot for CBS in 1950, which resulted in The Alan Young Show (1950). The show was a well-received live revue that ran for 3 years, earned a couple of Emmy Awards, and garnered Young a star on the \"Walk of Fame.\" However, the strain of writing and performing a weekly show got to Young, and the quality of the show declined, leading to his departure from the show and its cancellation. In the meantime, based on his popularity on radio and television, Young had established a film career, starting with his debut in Margie (1946) followed by Chicken Every Sunday (1949), Mr. Belvedere Goes to College (1949), Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick (1952), Androcles and the Lion (1952), Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), Tom Thumb (1958), and The Time Machine (1960). In the early 1960s, Young landed his best-known role, Wilbur Post, in the popular television series Mister Ed (1958), which ran for 5 years. Since then, Young has made a number of television and film appearances but is known primarily for his voice characterizations in cartoons, especially as Scrooge McDuck in DuckTales (1987).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2MTU1NDE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQwODk1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949241","name":"Alan Young","nicknames":["Al Young"],"idIMDB":"nm0949241"},"actorId":"nm0949241","character":"Flower Store Worker","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0262158","main":true},{"actorName":"Myndy Crist","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0188041","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5OTE0NjcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM0MzExMDI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 February 1975","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Myndy Zeno","height":"5' 6\" (1.68 m)","bio":"Grew up in Marin County, California.
