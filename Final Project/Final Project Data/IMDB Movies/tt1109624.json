She is of English and Irish descent. Hawkins was brought up in Greenwich, in southeast London. She attended James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich. She graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1998. Hawkins' theatre appearances include Much Ado About Nothing (2000), A Midsummer Night's Dream (2000), Misconceptions (2001), Country Music (2004), and David Hare's adaptation of Federico García Lorca's play The House of Bernarda Alba in 2005. Hawkins made her first notable screen performance as Samantha in the 2002 Mike Leigh film All or Nothing (2002). She also appeared as Slasher in the 2004 film Layer Cake (2004). She played the role of Zena Blake in the BBC adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel, Tipping the Velvet (2002) in 2002. Her first major television role came in 2005, when she played Susan Trinder in the BAFTA-nominated BBC drama Fingersmith (2005), an adaptation of Sarah Waters' novel of the same name, in which she co-starred with Imelda Staunton, as she had in Vera Drake (2004). Since then she has gone on to star in another BBC adaptation, Patrick Hamilton's Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky. Hawkins appeared in three episodes of the BBC comedy series Little Britain (2003), in addition to Ed Reardon's Week on BBC Radio 4. She has also contributed to the BBC Radio 4 series Concrete Cow. In 2006, Hawkins returned to the stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre in Jez Butterworth's The Winterling. In 2007, she played the lead in a new film of Jane Austen's Persuasion, and followed this with her critically acclaimed performance in Happy-Go-Lucky (2008). Questions and a minor controversy arose when Hawkins was not nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Poppy. It was the first year since 2000-01 that the winner of the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy was not nominated for an Academy Award, and the first year since 1995-96 that no one from the category was nominated. During 2006 she also made uncredited appearances in Richard Ayoade's Man to Man with Dean Learner where she played various uncredited roles from Personal Assistant to Wife of Steve Pising in various deleted scenes included on the DVD. Hawkins' 2009-10 films included Desert Flower (2009), Never Let Me Go (2010), and Happy Ever Afters (2009). In November 2010, she appeared on Broadway as Vivie in Mrs. Warren's Profession. In 2011, Hawkins appeared in Submarine (2010) and had a supporting role in the film adaptation of Jane Eyre (2011).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE4MDE0MDEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI1NTU5MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1020089","name":"Sally Hawkins","idIMDB":"nm1020089"},"actorId":"nm1020089","character":"Mary Brown","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0416646","main":true},{"actorName":"Madeleine Harris","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4189049","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"4' 10\" (1.47 m)","bio":"Madeleine Harris is an actress, known for Paddington (2014), Man Down (2013) and The Psychopath Next Door (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4189049","name":"Madeleine Harris","idIMDB":"nm4189049"},"actorId":"nm4189049","character":"Judy Brown","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0416648","main":true},{"actorName":"Samuel Joslin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4575328","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA2NTM4NTMzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAxMzYwNjE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"4' 7\" (1.4 m)","bio":"Samuel Joslin is an actor, known for The Impossible (2012), Paddington (2014) and The Nostalgist (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA2NTM4NTMzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAxMzYwNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4575328","name":"Samuel Joslin","idIMDB":"nm4575328"},"actorId":"nm4575328","character":"Jonathan Brown","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0416649","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Bond","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1286491","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 January 1926","placeOfBirth":" Newbury, Berkshire, England, UK","birthName":"Thomas Michael Bond","bio":"Michael Bond was born on January 13, 1926 in Newbury, Berkshire, England as Thomas Michael Bond.

A bona fide talent, her infectious spirit and self-deprecating sense of humor eventually captured the hearts of international audiences. The small and slender actress with the prominent cheekbones has yet to give an uninteresting performance. She was born Julia Mary Walters on February 22, 1950 in Smethwick, West Midlands, England, the youngest of three children and only daughter of Mary Bridget (O'Brien), an Irish-born postal clerk from County Mayo, and Thomas Walters, an English-born builder, from Birmingham. Convent schooled in Birmingham, she expressed an early desire to act. Her iron-willed mother had other ideas, however, and geared her towards a nursing career. Dutifully applying at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, Julie eventually gave up nursing when the pull to be an actress proved too strong. Studying English and Drama at Manchester Polytechnic, she subsequently joined a theatre company in Liverpool and apprenticed as a stand-up comic. A one-time company member of the Vanload improv troupe, she made her London stage debut in the aptly-titled comedy \"Funny Peculiar\" in 1975, and went on to develop a successfully bawdy act on the cabaret circuit. While at Manchester, Julie befriended aspiring writer/comedienne Victoria Wood and the twosome appeared together in sketch comedy. A couple of their works, \"Talent\" and \"Nearly a Happy Ending,\" transferred to TV and were accompanied by rave reviews. Eventually they were handed their own TV series, Wood and Walters (1981). In 1980, Julie scored a huge solo success under the theatre lights when she made her London debut in Willy Russell's \"Educating Rita.\" For her superlative performance she won both the Variety Critic's and London Critic's Circle Awards as the young hairdresser who vows to up her station in life by enrolling in a university. She conquered film as well when Educating Rita (1983) transferred to the big screen opposite Michael Caine as her Henry Higgins-like college professor, collecting a Golden Globe Award and Oscar nomination. Reuniting with Victoria Wood in 1984, the pair continue to appear together frequently on TV, most recently with the award-winning series Dinnerladies (1998). On stage Julie has impressed in a variety of roles ranging from the contemporary (\"Fool for Love,\" \"Frankie and Johnny at the Clair de Lune\") to the classics (\"Macbeth,\" \"The Rose Tattoo\" and \"All My Sons\"), winning the Olivier Award for the last-mentioned play. Following her success as Rita, she immediately rolled out a sterling succession of film femmes including her seedy waitress-turned-successful brothel-owner in Personal Services (1987); the unsophisticated, small-town wife of Phil Collins in Buster (1988); a boozy, man-chasing mum in Killing Dad or How to Love Your Mother (1990); and Liza Minnelli's abrasive tap student in Stepping Out (1991). Playing a wide variety of ages, she also mustered up a very convincing role as the mother of Joe Orton in the critically-acclaimed Prick Up Your Ears (1987). She capped her career in films as the abrasively stern but encouraging dance teacher in Billy Elliot (2000) which earned her a second Oscar nod and a healthy helping of quirky character parts, including her charming, charity-driven widow who poses à la natural in Calendar Girls (2003), and the maternal witch-wife Molly Weasley in the J.K. Rowling \"Harry Potter\" series. For her work on film and TV, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts has honored Julie five times, including four awards in a row (2001-2004). Married to Grant Roffey since 1997 after a 12-year relationship, the couple tend to a 70-acre organic farm they bought in Sussex. They have one child. Julie was honored with an OBE for her services to drama in 1999. A biography was published in 2003 entitled \"Julie Walters: Seriously Funny.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NDA2NjE0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk2ODIyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0910278","name":"Julie
