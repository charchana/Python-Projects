Described as part musical nonconformist, part piano virtuoso, he is considered by many to be a complete perfectionist in the art of merging musical styles. The young, talented, classically trained concert pianist and composer has been surprising people with his artful capacity since age twelve. Reuel's classical instruction was under the direction of highly regarded Dr. Julia Kruger and included master-classes with Professor Victor Bunin at The Tchaikovsky Conservatory. After his high school classical studies, Reuel was offered the unusual opportunity to score a foreign feature film. That film IJE, which was screened at The Warner Brothers Burbank Studios in LA, has gone on to win numerous awards from film festivals around the world. Many more films and music video collaborations have followed since then. Reuel's ability to mix classical piano styling and improvisation has helped him to win numerous national piano competitions. He has performed his classical and original compositions across the United States and occasionally in Europe. This dedication has afforded him the distinct honor of performing at the prestigious Carnegie Hall in New York City after winning first place in the Bradshaw and Buono International Piano Competition. The ability to combine his uniquely classical styling with his love of popular music has helped to coax a new and younger audience to appreciate sophisticated compositions. That accomplishment has earned him the praise of many of his contemporaries. His natural talent and flair for the spectacular has created a demand for his musical presentations. Defined by his fans as a \"musical nonconformist,\" Reuel combines popular music styles with classical training and composition and production abilities to create the innovative \"Modclass\" style. His compositions aim to synthesize audience appreciation for various musical styles while exploring new frontiers of musical expression. Over the past two years Reuel has frequently been asked to play for large private functions and charity events. Some of his favorite appearances include a commissioned composition performance for Red Cross of Texas, a show at Riverbend Centre, and finally a performance of original piano and cello music at Austin's prestigious hall The Long Center for the show titled \"Voices of Innocence.\" A member of The National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (GRAMMYS), Reuel was one of only a few pianists who took part in The 2006 GRAMMY Hilton Harmony Tour. Reuel has released four albums of original compositions. The release of his newest collection of \"Modclass infused material will coincide with his upcoming national and international performances in 2015.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3308037","name":"Reuel","idIMDB":"nm3308037"},"actorId":"nm3308037","character":"Billy Everybody","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Blake Beene","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2579920","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Blake Beene is an actor, known for Compose (2006), Doctor S Battles the Sex Crazed Reefer Zombies: The Movie (2009) and Beyond the Ring (2008).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2579920","name":"James Blake Beene","idIMDB":"nm2579920"},"actorId":"nm2579920","character":"Weak Doctor S","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Evan Boston","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3239256","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Evan Boston is a writer and actor, known for Sanitarium (2013), Doctor S Battles the Sex Crazed Reefer Zombies: The Movie (2009) and Spiral (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3239256","name":"Evan Boston","idIMDB":"nm3239256"},"actorId":"nm3239256","character":"Scientist 2","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Hartz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3309846","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"James Hartz is a writer and actor, known for Sanitarium (2013) and Doctor S Battles the Sex Crazed Reefer Zombies: The Movie (2009).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3309846","name":"James Hartz","idIMDB":"nm3309846"},"actorId":"nm3309846","character":"Scientist 1","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bryan Ortiz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2624159","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Bryan Ortiz is a director and writer, known for Sanitarium (2013), Doctor S Battles the Sex Crazed Reefer Zombies: The Movie (2009) and Goodbye Digital or The 5 Stages of Grief in Digital Dating (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2624159","name":"Bryan Ortiz","idIMDB":"nm2624159"},"actorId":"nm2624159","character":"Scientist 3","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elizabeth Ingalls","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2394773","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NDI5OTU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQxOTk3._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"birthName":"Elizabeth Rachele Ingalls","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Elizabeth Ingalls was born in a small town in Texas (New Braunfels) and raised in an even smaller town in Texas (Elgin).

Fortunately for audiences and filmmakers alike, the phase hasn't passed, as since that time, Cambell has had the pleasure of working with such acclaimed directors as Richard Linklater (on Boyhood), Kimberly Peirce (on Stop Loss), and Robert Rodriguez (on Shorts), as well as emerging filmmakers like Bryan Ortiz (on The Big Scary German and DR.
