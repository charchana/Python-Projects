She is of Han Chinese (Hokkien) descent, and spoke English and Malay before Chinese. A ballet dancer since age 4, she moved to London, England to study at the Royal Academy as a teenager. After a brief dance career, she won the Miss Malaysia beauty pageant title in her native country and the Miss Moomba beauty pageant title in Melbourne, Australia in the early 1980s. Her first on camera work was a 1984 commercial with martial arts star Jackie Chan. In 1985, she began making action movies with D&B Films of Hong Kong. She was first billed as Michelle Khan, then later, Michelle Yeoh. Never a trained martial artist, she relied on her dance discipline and her on-set trainers to prepare for her martial arts action scenes. She uses many dance moves in her films. She still does most of her own stunts and has been injured many times. Ironically, she still cannot read Chinese and she has to have Chinese script read to her. In 1988, she married wealthy D&B Films executive Dickson Poon and retired from acting. Even though they divorced in 1992, she is close to Poon's second wife and a godmother to Poon's daughter. When she returned to acting, she became very popular to Chinese audiences and she became known to western audiences through her co-starring roles in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and in the phenomenally successful Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) aka Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' directed by Ang Lee. She turned down a role in a sequel to The Matrix (1999). She has her own production company, Mythical Films and has trained with the Shen Yang Acrobatic team for her role in Le talisman (2002), an English language film she is both starring in and producing. She hopes to use her company to discover and nurture new film-making talent. She also wants to act in roles that combine both action and deeper spiritual themes.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NTI0NDkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYwMTIwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000706","name":"Michelle Yeoh","idIMDB":"nm0000706"},"actorId":"nm0000706","character":"Inspector Ng","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Cynthia Rothrock","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001686","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMzgyNTYxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3MTA5NTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 March 1957","placeOfBirth":" Wilmington, Delaware, USA","birthName":"Cynthia Ann Christine Rothrock","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Cynthia Rothrock was born on March 8, 1957 in Wilmington, Delaware, USA as Cynthia Ann Christine Rothrock.

An internationally acclaimed visionary director, Hark started making experimental movies with 8mm film when he was only 13. After graduating from the University of Texas in Austin, majoring in film, he returned to Hong Kong in 1977 and landed a job working in television. In 1979 he directed his film debut, The Butterfly Murders (1979). It raised a lot of attention, and was hailed by many as the start of a new wave in Hong Kong cinema. After making numerous critically and successful films, he co-founded his own production house, Film Workshop, with his wife, Nansun Shi, in 1984. Although the company was intended to be contemporary, it went on to become one of the most successful production companies in Hong Kong, having produced such classics of Hong Kong cinema as _Sinnui yauwan (1987)_ and A Better Tomorrow (1986), which was directed by John Woo and starred the amazing Yun-Fat Chow. Considered the master of kung-fu action films, Tsui Hark's The Swordsman (1990), _Xiao ao jiang hu zhi dong fang bu bai (1991)_, L'auberge du dragon (1992) and Once Upon a Time in China (1991) created a new era and standard for the \"wuxia\" genre that has now become a trend in filmmaking.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzMzg0OTc3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI4OTI4OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007139","name":"Hark Tsui","idIMDB":"nm0007139"},"actorId":"nm0007139","character":"Panadol","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Tien","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862875","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"birthName":"James Tien Chun","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"James Tien was born in Hong Kong, China as James Tien Chun.
