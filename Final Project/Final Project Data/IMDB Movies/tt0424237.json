When the shy Chimo meets the gorgeous and sexy new-arrival in the ghetto Lila, who lives with a deranged aunt, his gross friend Mouloud falls for her. However, Chimo becomes close to Lila, who seduces him with her sexual games, telling him about her perverted sexual experience. The inexperienced Chimo falls in love for her, but he does not know how to declare his love for the girl. When Mouloud sneaks and listens to a private conversation between Lila and Chimo, he concludes that the girl is a whore, with tragic consequences.","simplePlot":"Two inner-city teenagers engage in an obsessive, innocent flirtation fueled by Lila's sexually explicit overtures.","actors":[{"actorName":"Vahina Giocante","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320209","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMjc0OTE0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk0MDUyNQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 June 1981","placeOfBirth":" Orléans, Loiret, France","bio":"Vahina Giocante was born on June 30, 1981 in Orléans, Loiret, France.
