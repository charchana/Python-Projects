His father had English and some German, ancestry, while his mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. Ron Howard was working on Splash (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation. In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay. Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy _That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwNDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2NDY3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158","name":"Tom Hanks","idIMDB":"nm0000158"},"actorId":"nm0000158","character":"Thomas Schell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0281165","main":true},{"actorName":"Thomas Horn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4223385","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk5NTc4NDcyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc5OTMxNw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Thomas Horn won on \"Jeopardy!\" during Kids Week with an earning of 31,000 after wagering 12,000 during Final Jeopardy.

Her mother, Helga Bullock (née Helga Mathilde Meyer), was a German opera singer. Her father, John W. Bullock, was an American voice teacher, who was born in Alabama, of Irish, English, French, and German descent. Sandra grew up on the road with her parents and younger sister, chef Gesine Bullock-Prado, and spent much of her childhood in Nuremberg, Germany. She often performed in the children's chorus of whatever production her mother was in. That singing talent later came in handy for her role as an aspiring country singer in The Thing Called Love (1993). Her family moved back to the Washington area when she was adolescent. She later enrolled in East Carolina University in North Carolina, where she studied acting. Shortly afterward she moved to New York to pursue a career on the stage. This led to acting in television programs and then feature films. She gave memorable performances in Demolition Man (1993) and Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993), but did not achieve the stardom that seemed inevitable for her until her work in the smash hit Speed (1994). She now ranks as one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. For her role in The Blind Side (2009) she won the Oscar, and her blockbusters The Proposal (2009), The Heat (2013) and Gravity (2013) made her a bankable star. With $56,000,000, she was listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the highest-paid actress in the world.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NDY5NjU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ0MTMyMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113","name":"Sandra Bullock","nicknames":["Sandy","America's Sweetheart","The Girl Next Door"],"idIMDB":"nm0000113"},"actorId":"nm0000113","character":"Linda Schell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0278253","main":true},{"actorName":"Zoe Caldwell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0129807","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1ODc5NDg3ODVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA1MjQ0MTc@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 September 1933","placeOfBirth":" Melbourne, Australia","bio":"As a testament to her remarkable talent, Broadway has honored esteemed stage actress Zoe Caldwell four times with Tony Awards: for \"Slapstick Tragedy\" (1966), for her title role in \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" (1968), for her searing performance as \"Medea\" (1982), and as opera diva Maria Callas in \"Master Class\" (1995). The Australian-born actress began her professional career at the tender age of 9 in a production of \"Peter Pan\" and went on to find radio work in her teens. Her parents provided her with the necessary foundation long ago with lessons in dance, elocution and music. She left school at age 15 and made her living teaching speech and performing on a children's radio program. Years of repertory work accumulated a formidable resume. She was one of the original members of Melbourne's Union Theatre Repertory Company (1954-1957) and appeared for two seasons with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in productions of \"Pericles\" and \"Much Ado About Nothing.\" She also toured Russia with the latter company in \"Hamlet,\" \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Romeo and Juliet.\" In 1963 she helped launch the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre. Broadway finally opened its curtains for her in 1965 when she briefly replaced Anne Bancroft in \"The Devils.\", and has since continued her routine of standing ovations with extraordinary performances as Eve in \"The Creation of the World and Other Business\" (1972: produced by the renown Robert Whitehead, her husband from 1968) and as Lillian Hellman in \"Lillian\" (1986). To the dismay of film audiences, Ms. Caldwell has managed to avoid the silver screen, appearing briefly in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) and scoring a larger role in Birth (2004). She took her resounding stage triumph \"Medea\" to TV and also performed magnificently as Lady Macbeth and Sarah Bernhardt on the small screen. As a now-prestigious stage director, she made her Broadway bow in 1977 with \"An Almost Perfect Person,\" and later helmed productions of \"Richard II,\" \"Othello,\" \"Macbeth\" and, more recently, \"Vita and Virginia\" starring Eileen Atkins and Vanessa Redgrave. She and husband Whitehead have maintained a long and successful private and professional partnership, first working together on \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" and later with \"Medea.\" Their son, Charles Whitehead, was the producer of \"The Play What I Wrote\" which briefly featured Ms. Caldwell in New York in 2003.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1ODc5NDg3ODVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA1MjQ0MTc@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0129807","name":"Zoe Caldwell","idIMDB":"nm0129807"},"actorId":"nm0129807","character":"Oskar's Grandmother","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0303757","main":true},{"actorName":"Dennis Hearn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3594647","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Dennis Hearn is an actor, known for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), Howl (2010) and Violet Tendencies (2010).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3594647","name":"Dennis Hearn","idIMDB":"nm3594647"},"actorId":"nm3594647","character":"Minister","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0303760","main":true},{"actorName":"Paul Klementowicz","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0459217","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAyNjM1NjM1NjReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDExODY2MTMx._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 August 1959","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Paul Klementowicz was born on August 10, 1959 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA.

He is the son of Baroness Maria Margareta (Rappe), a teacher, and Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, an ethnologist and folklore professor. His surname traces back to his father's partial German ancestry. When he was in high school, he and a few fellow students, including Yvonne Lombard, started a theatre club which encouraged his interest in acting. After conscription, he began to study at the Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school (1948-1951), together with Lars Ekborg, Margaretha Krook and Ingrid Thulin. His first role was as Nils the crofter in Alf Sjöberg's Only a Mother (1949). After graduation, he worked at the city theatres in Norrköping and Malmö. His work in the movies by Ingmar Bergman (especially The Seventh Seal (1957), that includes the iconic scenes in which he plays chess with Death) made him well-known internationally, and he started to get offers from abroad. His career abroad began with him playing Jesus in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965); Hawaii (1966) and The Quiller Memorandum (1966). Since then, his career includes very different kind of characters, like Karl Oskar Nilsson in The Emigrants (1971); Father Lankester Merrin in The Exorcist (1973); Joubert the assassin in Three Days of the Condor (1975), Emperor Ming in Flash Gordon (1980); the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the Never Say Never Again (1983); Liet-Kynes in Dune (1984) the artist Frederick in Hannah and Her Sisters (1986); Lassefar in Pelle the Conqueror (1987), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination; Dr. Peter Ingham in Awakenings (1990); Lamar Burgess in Minority Report (2002) and The Renter in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), which earned him his second Academy Award nomination. He has become one of Sweden's most admired and professional actors and is the only male Swedish actor to receive an Oscar nomination. Max has been nominated twice: for Pelle the Conqueror (1987) in 1988 and for Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) in 2012. He received the Guldbagge Award for Best Director in his directing debut, the drama film Katinka (1988).

Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990's Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright's harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright's skill has been proven over and over again.
