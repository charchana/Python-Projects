He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (The X-Files (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\". Henriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien: Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra. James Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981), then used him again in The Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Mort ou vif (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998). In addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkwOTMyMDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4NTUyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000448","name":"Lance Henriksen","idIMDB":"nm0000448"},"actorId":"nm0000448","character":"Devlin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"James Earl Jones","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000469","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwNTg1MzMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQyMDgyMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 January 1931","placeOfBirth":" Arkabutla, Mississippi, USA","height":"6' 1½\" (1.87 m)","bio":"James Earl Jones was born on January 17, 1931 in Arkabutla, Mississippi, USA.

He is probably best known for his role as Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy (for the voice only, as the man in the Darth Vader suit was David Prowse, whose voice was dubbed because of his British West Country accent). He has appeared on the animated series The Simpsons (1989) three times and played Mufasa in The Lion King (1994).

Born in Washington, D.C., Todd spent two years on a scholarship at the University of Connecticut, which, in turn, led to a scholarship from the renowned Eugene O'Neill National Theatre Institute. It proved to be the foundation for intense stints at the Hartman Conservatory in Stamford, Connecticut and the Trinity Square Repertory Theatre Conservatory in Providence, Rhode Island. Todd appeared in dozens of classical and many experimental plays, yet still managed to find time to teach playwriting to high school students in the Hartford public school system. Todd's extensive credits exemplify his versatility. They include such film classics as The Rock (1996), The Crow (1994), Lean on Me (1989), Bird (1988), Night of the Living Dead (1990), Destination finale (2000), the multiple Academy Award winning Oliver Stone film Platoon (1986) and Le secret (2000), which was nominated and screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Todd's recent films include the independent film Silence (2002) and Final Destination 2 (2003). He has had prominent guest starring roles in numerous critically-acclaimed television series, including recurring on Boston Public (2000), For the People (2002) and The District (2000), as well as NYPD Blue (1993), Smallville (2001), Law & Order (1990), Crossing Jordan (2001), Homicide: Life on the Street (1993) and The X-Files (1993). Todd recurred on three incarnations of \"Star Trek\" and guest starred on Xena: Warrior Princess (1995) and episodes of CSI: Miami (2002) and Andromeda (2000). His television movies include starring roles in True Women (1997), Black Fox (1995), Butter (1998), Ivory Hunters (1990), Babylon 5: A Call to Arms (1999) and Control Factor (2003). Todd's considerable theatre credits include the world premiere of award-winning playwright August Wilson's \"King Hedley II\", where he originated the title role in Pittsburgh, Seattle and Boston. Variety commented: \"Todd's King Hedley dominates the stage. A sour-faced mix of rage and resolve, anger and vulnerability. Todd's Hedley was a memorable tour-de-force even on opening.\" He also received a coveted Helen Hayes nomination for his performance in Athol Fugard's \"The Captain's Tiger at La Jolla, the Manhattan Theatre Club and the Kennedy Center. Other theatre credits include \"Les Blancs\", \"Playboy of the West Indies\", \"Othello\", \"Zooman and the Sign\", award-winning playwright Keith Glover's \"Dark Paradise\", \"Aida\" (on Broadway), and most recently, \"Levee James\" for the prestigious Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference and The New Dramatist Guild.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNTI1Njc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4NzcyNg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865302","name":"Tony Todd","idIMDB":"nm0865302"},"actorId":"nm0865302","character":"Frankie Hawkins","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0098545","main":true},{"actorName":"Burt Young","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949350","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMDYzNjU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0OTI5MDE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 April 1940","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Richard Morea","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Burly, talented character actor who has remained consistently busy playing \"rough at the edge\" type characters, often on the wrong side of the law.

Young received his dramatic arts training under legendary acting coach Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Young first gathered notice playing tough thugs in such films as The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight (1971), Across 110th Street (1972), Chinatown (1974) and The Gambler (1974). Fiery director Sam Peckinpah cast Young as the getaway driver / assassin, \"Mac\", in The Killer Elite (1975), and Young came to the attention of newcomer Sylvester Stallone, who cast him as future brother-in-law 'Paulie' in the 1976 sleeper hit Rocky (1976). The talented Young was nominated for an Oscar, and has gone on to reprise the role in all five \"Rocky\" sequels to date! Peckinpah re-hired him to play renegade trucker \"Pigpen\" in the moderately successful Convoy (1978) (watch for \"Pigpen's\" Mack truck where the writing on the door states \"Paulie Hauling\"!). Young has also appeared in numerous other major productions, including Il était une fois en Amérique (1984), The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984), Last Exit to Brooklyn (1989), Mickey Blue Eyes (1999) and The Adventures of Pluto Nash (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMDYzNjU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk0OTI5MDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949350","name":"Burt Young","idIMDB":"nm0949350"},"actorId":"nm0949350","character":"Sal DiMarco","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Antoni Corone","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139175","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4OTYyNzIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI3NDkyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR9,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"When character actor Antoni Corone launched his screen career in the mid-'80s, producers immediately foresaw a perfect niche for him, and started casting him as rugged, slightly imposing and domineering types -- including club bouncers, security personnel, military men and officers of the law.
