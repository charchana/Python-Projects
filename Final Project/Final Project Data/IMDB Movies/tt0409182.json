Lucas' film career began by accident in 1979 when a small Canadian film production shot on the tiny coastal South Carolina Island, Sullivan's Island, where Lucas and his family lived. Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, 8 year old Lucas was hiding in the sand dunes watching filming during the climatic scene where teenage lovers engage in a lovesick fight. It was during this experience that Lucas decided to pursue a career in film which he has now done for nearly 3 decades. Born to young radical politically active parents in Arkansas in 1971, Lucas spent his early childhood nomadically moving around the southern U.S. The family finally settled in Gig Harbor, Washington, where Lucas attended high school. The school had an award winning drama/debate program and Lucas won the State Championship in Dramatic Interpretation and competed at the 1989 National Championship. Brief stints in professional theater in Seattle followed before Lucas moved to Los Angeles. After receiving breaks playing a young George Armstrong Custer in the Steven Spielberg produced Class of '61 (1993) and Frank Marshall's film Alive (1993), Lucas' career toiled in minor TV appearances. Frustrated, he decided to start over and relocated to New York City. In NYC, Lucas studied acting for years under Suzanne Shepherd and worked in smaller theater productions like Shakespeare in the Parking Lot before receiving another break in 1997 when he was cast as Judas in Terrence McNally's controversial off-Broadway production Corpus Christi. The play led to his being cast in the films You Can Count on Me (2000) and American Psycho (2000). These films were followed by interesting performances in the Oscar-winning A Beautiful Mind (2001) and the box office hit Sweet Home Alabama (2002). Lucas has since worked with many of the film community's greatest talents. He starred alongside Jon Voight in Jerry Bruckheimer's Glory Road (2006), for which Lucas added 40 pounds to transform himself into legendary basketball coach Don Haskins. Lucas also starred with Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss in Wolfgang Petersen's Poseidon (2006). He starred with Morgan Freeman and Robert Redford in Lasse Hallström's An Unfinished Life (2005). He also starred opposite Jamie Bell in David Gordon Green's Undertow (2004), which was also produced by Terrence Malick. Additionally, Lucas worked alongside Christopher Walken in Around the Bend (2004). He performed with Jennifer Connelly and Eric Bana in Ang Lee's Hulk (2003). Other credits include Wonderland (2003), The Deep End (2001), American Psycho (2000), Session 9 (2001) and You Can Count on Me (2000). Lucas' theater credits include the off-Broadway run of \"Spalding Gray: Stories Left to Tell\"; Tennessee Williams' \"The Glass Menagerie\", which appeared on Broadway in 2005; Terrence McNally's \"Corpus Christi\" at the Manhattan Theater Club; Christopher Shinn's \"What Didn't Happen\"; and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". Lucas has always been fascinated by documentaries and performed voice work with film legend Ken Burns on the documentary The War (2007), and also provided voice-over work for Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience (2007), Trumbo (2007) and Resolved (2007). Lucas' first venture into production was Stolen (2009), in which he played the single father of a mentally challenged boy. The film was the first project to be produced through Lucas' production company, \"Two Bridges\". In the past few years, Lucas' films include The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), Daydream Nation (2010), Peacock (2010), as Charles Lindbergh in Clint Eastwood's film J. Edgar (2011), and the massive Australian box office and critical success Red Dog (2011), for which Lucas won Australia's best actor award (The I.F. Award). He also played Beat generation legend Neal Cassady in Big Sur (2013). He can be seen in Kevin Connolly's Dear Eleanor (2016), the upcoming Sundance festival film Little Accidents and the NY indie film The Mend.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzkzOTAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE3Mjc4NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524197","name":"Josh Lucas","idIMDB":"nm0524197"},"actorId":"nm0524197","character":"Dylan Johns","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009096","main":true},{"actorName":"Kurt Russell","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MjkxNzQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDk4ODM1._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 March 1951","placeOfBirth":" Springfield, Massachusetts, USA","birthName":"Kurt Vogel Russell","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Kurt Russell was born Kurt Vogel Russell in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Louise Julia (Crone), a dancer, and actor Bing Russell (Neil Oliver Russell). He is of English, German, Scottish, and Irish descent. His first roles were as a child in television series, including a lead role in the Western series The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (1963). Russell landed a part in the Elvis Presley movie, It Happened at the World's Fair (1963), when he was ten years old. Walt Disney himself signed Russell to a 10-year contract, and, according to Robert Osborne, he became the studio's top star of the 1970s. Having voiced adult Copper in the animated Disney film The Fox and the Hound (1981), Russell is one of the few famous child stars in Hollywood who has been able to continue his acting career past his teen years. Kurt spent the early 1970s playing minor league baseball. In 1979, he gave a classic performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's ABC TV movie Elvis (1979), and married the actress who played Priscilla Presley in the film, Season Hubley. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for the role. He followed with roles in a string of well-received films, including Used Cars (1980) and Silkwood (1983), for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. During the 1980s, he starred in several films by director Carpenter; they created some of his best-known roles, including anti-hero army-turned-robber Snake Plissken in the futuristic action film Escape from New York (1981) (and later in its 1996 sequel Escape from L.A. (1996)), Antarctic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady in the horror film The Thing (1982), and Jack Burton in the fantasy film Big Trouble in Little China (1986), all of which have since become cult classics. The Thing was based on the short story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell, Jr., which had been interpreted on film before, albeit loosely, in 1951's The Thing from Another World (1951). In Big Trouble in Little China, Russell played a truck driver caught in an ancient Chinese war. In 1983, he became reacquainted with Goldie Hawn (who appeared with him in The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968)) when they worked together on Swing Shift (1984). The two have lived together ever since. They made another film together, Garry Marshall's comedy Overboard (1987). His other 1980s titles include The Best of Times (1986), Winter People (1989), and the hit Tango & Cash (1989). In 1991, he headlined the firefighter drama Backdraft (1991), in 1993, he starred as Wyatt Earp in the western film Tombstone (1993), and in 1994, had a starring role in the military science fiction film Stargate - La porte des étoiles (1994). In the mid-2000s, his portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach Herb Brooks in Miracle (2004) won the praise of critics. In 2006, he appeared in the disaster-thriller Poseidon (2006), and in 2007, in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof (2007) segment from the film Grindhouse (2007). Russell appeared in The Battered Bastards of Baseball (2014), a documentary about his father and the Portland Mavericks, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. He co-starred in the action thriller Furious 7 (2015). In 2015, Russell starred in the western films Bone Tomahawk (2015) and The Hateful Eight (2015), and in 2016, he had a leading role in the dramatization Deepwater (2016). Russell and Goldie Hawn live on a 72-acre retreat, Home Run Ranch, outside of Aspen. He has two sons, Boston Russell (from his marriage to Hubley) and Wyatt Russell (with Hawn). He also raised Hawn's children, actors Oliver Hudson and Kate Hudson, who just call him dad.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MjkxNzQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDk4ODM1._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621","name":"Kurt Russell","idIMDB":"nm0000621"},"actorId":"nm0000621","character":"Robert Ramsey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009095","main":true},{"actorName":"Jacinda Barrett","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057150","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NjE2NzA4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3NzUxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 August 1972","placeOfBirth":" Brisbane, Queensland, Australia","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Jacinda Barrett was born in Australia. Her convincing accent has paved the way for numerous acting roles in the USA. Barrett was first introduced to American audiences via MTV's Real World (1992), during its fourth season, which was set in London. Jacinda Barrett received her first break on the big screen in La couleur du mensonge (2003), directed by Oscar winner Robert Benton, alongside Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman, for which she received critical praise. Soon after, she starred in Ladder 49 (2004), a movie that honored her firefighter father, where she worked with Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. The movie spanned 10 years in the life of a Baltimore firefighting family. Soon after, she was in love with Renée Zellweger's \"Bridget\" in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (2004). She also starred in the action disaster movie, Poseidon (2006), directed by Wolfgang Petersen, and the comedy, School for Scoundrels (2006), with Billy Bob Thornton. She again received critical praise for her challenging role in The Last Kiss (2006). A.O. Scott said of her performance, \"Ms. Barrett is a glowing, lovely presence, giving full voice to the rage, humiliation and hurt\". Shauna Lyon in the New Yorker writes, \"Jacinda Barrett steals the show as Michael's beautiful, reasonable life partner, offering a volatile, realistic portrayal of a woman scorned\". Jacinda was directed by Mira Nair in the adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \"The Namesake\", and starred alongside her husband, Gabriel Macht, in Middle Men (2009), a tale of the founding of the Internet porn industry. She has starred in multiple TV series, most recently, alongside Anthony Edwards, in Zero Hour (2013), a show that is no longer on the air. Even though Jacinda grew up in Brisbane, her first Australian role was headlining Matching Jack (2010), as she left home at 17 to work and travel the world. She is married to Gabriel Macht and they have one daughter and one son, together. She has been named one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NjE2NzA4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3NzUxNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0057150","name":"Jacinda Barrett","idIMDB":"nm0057150"},"actorId":"nm0057150","character":"Maggie James","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009102","main":true},{"actorName":"Richard Dreyfuss","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000377","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMjIzMjM2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAxMDY0Mg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 October 1947","placeOfBirth":" Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Richard Stephen Dreyfus","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Richard Dreyfuss is an American leading man, who has played his fair share of irritating pests and brash, ambitious hustlers. He was born Richard Stephen Dreyfus in Brooklyn, New York, to Geraldine (Robbins), an activist, and Norman Dreyfus, a restaurateur and attorney. His paternal grandparents were Austro-Hungarian Jewish immigrants, and his mother's family was Russian Jewish. Richard Dreyfuss worked his way up through bit parts (The Graduate (1967), for one) and TV before gaining attention with his portrayal of Baby Face Nelson in John Milius' Dillinger (1973). He gained prominence as a college-bound young man in American Graffiti (1973) and as a nervy Jewish kid with high hopes in L'apprentissage de Duddy Kravitz (1974). By the latter part of the 1970s Dreyfuss was established as a major star, playing leads (and alter-egos) for Steven Spielberg in two of the top-grossing films of the that decade: Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). He won a Best Actor Oscar in his first romantic lead as an out-of-work actor in The Goodbye Girl (1977). Dreyfuss also produced and starred in the entertaining private eye movie The Big Fix (1978). After a brief lull in the early 1980s, a well-publicized drug problem and a string of box-office disappointments (The Competition (1980), Whose Life Is It Anyway? (1981), The Buddy System (1984)), a clean and sober Dreyfuss re-established himself in the mid-'80s as one of Hollywood's more engaging leads. He co-starred with Bette Midler and Nick Nolte in Paul Mazursky's popular Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986). That same year he provided the narration and appeared in the opening and closing \"bookends\" of Rob Reiner's nostalgic Stand by Me (1986). He quickly followed that with Nuts (1987) opposite Barbra Streisand, Barry Levinson's Tin Men (1987) in a memorable teaming with Danny DeVito and Stakeout (1987) with Emilio Estevez. Dreyfuss continued working steadily through the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s, most notably in Mazursky's farce Moon Over Parador (1988), Spielberg's Always (1989), Postcards from the Edge (1990) and Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990). He appeared as a member of an ensemble that included Holly Hunter, Gena Rowlands and Danny Aiello in the romantic comedy Once Around (1991) and as a pop psychiatrist, the author of several successful self-help books, who is driven to the edge by nutcase Bill Murray in the popular comedy What About Bob? (1991). Dreyfuss has also remained active in the theater (\"Death and Maiden\", 1992) and on TV. He returned to features in the adaptation of Neil Simon's play Lost in Yonkers (1993) and followed with a supporting turn as the querulous political opponent in The American President (1995). Dreyfuss received some of the best notices of his career as a determined, inspiring music teacher coping with a deaf son and the demands of his career in Mr. Holland's Opus (1995).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMjIzMjM2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAxMDY0Mg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000377","name":"Richard Dreyfuss","idIMDB":"nm0000377"},"actorId":"nm0000377","character":"Richard Nelson","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009105","main":true},{"actorName":"Emmy Rossum","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002536","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwODE0NjU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAyMDYzMw@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 September 1986","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Emmanuelle Grey Rossum","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"It would seem that 2004, the year of her 18th birthday, will be remembered as pivotal for Emmy Rossum due to her appearance in two very different films, The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and The Phantom of the Opera (2004). Emmy's performance in the latter film gained her a Golden Globe nomination. Emmanuelle Grey Rossum was born in New York City, where she was raised by her single mother, Cheryl Rossum, a corporate photographer (she has only met her father a few times). Her mother is of Russian Jewish descent and her father has English and Dutch ancestry. After passing an audition at the Metropolitan Opera when she was 7 years old, Rossum performed in more than 20 operas in six different languages at Lincoln Center, alongside such figures as Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. She was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in \"Carmen.\" She left the opera when she entered her teenage years, as she had grown too tall to perform as a child. Emmy also appeared in a Carnegie Hall presentation of \"The Damnation of Faust.\" She graduated from the Spence School, a private institution in Manhattan, in 1996 and then earned a high school diploma when 15 years old by taking online extension courses offered by Stanford University (Education Program for Gifted Youth). She later enrolled at Columbia University and studied art history and French. In a change of venue, Emmy created the role of Abigail Williams in the daytime soap opera As the World Turns (1956) in 1997 and branched out in performances in the made-for-television movies Genius (1999) and The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), in which she played the title character as a young teenager. Other television work included Snoops (1999), Law & Order (1990), and The Practice (1997). Emmy made her theatrical feature debut in the indie film Songcatcher (2000), with her good friend Rhoda Griffis, which won the Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000. Rossum received an Independent Spirit Award nomination in the category of Best Debut Performance for her performance as an Appalachian orphan. She played an aspiring songwriter (the title character) in the romantic comedy Nola (2003). Cast as the ill-fated daughter of a small-business owner in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), she projected an aura of innocence that made her character's tragic death memorable and heartbreaking. This was her first major studio film. After six months of filming her role as the fresh-faced but highly intelligent teenage damsel in distress The Day After Tomorrow (2004) in Montreal, she returned to New York and screen-tested for the role of Christine in The Phantom of the Opera (2004) in full costume and makeup, and was finally selected for the part by Andrew Lloyd Webber after singing for him at his home. Although she was surprised to be chosen ahead of many better-known and older actresses considered for the part, the combination of her vulnerable, fragile beauty and fine, classically trained singing voice ultimately proved that she was perfectly cast. In preparation for the role, she took ballet classes for two months and started polishing her singing. Emmy has commented that, in her approach to acting, she draws heavily upon her own experiences, so she visited locations in Paris and conjured up what she terms \"past memories\" to draw upon in making her performance emotionally realistic. She stood on the roof of the Opéra Garnier, where Christine sings \"All I Ask of You,\" and went underneath the opera house, where there is actually a gloomy, dark lake. She studied Degas's paintings of ballerinas in the Musée d'Orsay to learn how to stand like one. Her next project Poseidon (2006) was a mainstream effort, but since its release, she has been more true to advice she obtained from Sean Penn when making Mystic River (2003), that she should be picky and only accept roles that are fun to do, such as Dragonball: Evolution (2009).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwODE0NjU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAyMDYzMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002536","name":"Emmy Rossum","nicknames":["Em","Emmy Grey"],"idIMDB":"nm0002536"},"actorId":"nm0002536","character":"Jennifer Ramsey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009098","main":true},{"actorName":"Mía Maestro","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0535502","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDMxNTg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NjIxMDI@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 June 1978","placeOfBirth":" Buenos Aires, Federal District, Argentina","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Beautiful and talented actress Mia Maestro was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

This was followed by four other films: The Venice Project (1999), Timecode (2000), Picking Up the Pieces (2000) and El astillero (2000). Maestro made her television debut in 2000, when she starred in the television movie For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story (2000).

She also appeared in the film Poseidon. In 2004, Maestro was cast in the spy drama Alias. She originally met with the show's producer, J.J. Abrams, intending to get a role on another one of his projects, Lost. Introduced late into the third season, she plays Nadia Santos, the daughter resulting from the affair between Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) and Irina Derevko (Lena Olin); thus, she is the half-sister of Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner). She later works as an Argentinean intelligence agent as well as a special agent for the CIA, which marked her character being turned into a regular one starting from the fourth season. She won an Imagen Award-given out to honor Latino members of the entertainment industry-for Best Supporting Actress in 2004.

As a child actress, she appeared on the television program Kids Incorporated (1984) for several years with Renee Sands. Later, Ferguson was a member of the female trio Wild Orchid, which she fronted with fellow Kids Incorporated (1984) star Renee Sands and Stefanie Ridel. Wild Orchid released two albums, but after completing a third album, their record label declined to release it. This prompted an emotional crisis, and Ferguson sought therapy. She left the group shortly thereafter. In 2003, she was invited for a part in The Black Eyed Peas' song \"Hey Mama.\" The members of the group were so impressed by her performance that she became the fourth member of the band. Since then, she's mostly known as \"Fergie.\" In September 2004, Fergie met an American actor, Josh Duhamel, who she married in 2009. She took part in a Hollywood blockbuster, Poseidon (2006). Fergie is a favorite singer of Quentin Tarantino, who invited her to co-star in his movie Grindhouse (2007).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNzExMTU1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkyMjIzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004914","name":"Fergie","nicknames":["Stace","Fergie","The Dutchess","Fergalicious"],"idIMDB":"nm0004914"},"actorId":"nm0004914","character":"Gloria","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0009099","main":true},{"actorName":"Andre Braugher","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0105672","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyNTIwOTY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE2NzU3MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 July 1962","placeOfBirth":" Chicago, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Andre K.
