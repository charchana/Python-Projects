Not only are gays being threatened by Thatcher but the miners are on strike in response to her pit closures and Northern Irish activist Mark Ashton believes gays and miners should show solidarity. Almost by accident a mini-bus full of gays find themselves in the Welsh village of Onllwyn in the Dulais valley and through their sincere fund raising and Jonathan's nifty disco moves persuade most of the community that they are on the same side. When a bigot tries to sabotage the partnership with a tabloid smear Mark turns it back on her with a hugely successful benefit concert to which most of the villagers, now thoroughly in tune with their gay friends, turn up.

His father is Australian. At the age of ten, George was scouted to audition for a role in the family feature, Peter Pan. He quickly landed the part of Curly, one of the Lost Boys, and went on to have several minor roles on TV, including an episode of Rose & Maloney and Footprints in the Snow. At thirteen, George landed the part of Riccio in the film adaptation of Cornelia Funke's best-selling children's novel, The Theif Lord and was also cast in lead role for BBC adaptation of Terry Pratchett's, Johnny and the Bomb. George worked with Tim Roth, Chiwetel Ejiofer and Sophie Okonedo for the HBO Movie Tsunami - The Aftermath and later took a part in the Dikensian drama, The Old Curiosity Shop. Soon after, George co-starred with Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber on Defiance. In 2009, George took on the role of Harry, in The Boys are Back alongside Clive Owen, for which he received 2 award nominations. His career took another step forward with Hunky Dory. Since, George has featured in several shorts which have been popular on the festival circuit and played the part of Tommo Peaceful with counterpart Jack O'Connell in the adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's Private Peaceful. 2013 was George's breakthrough year, and was recognised for his parts as Aaron in For Those in Peril, Davy in the musical Sunshine on Leith, Jake Whittam in Breakfast with Johnny Wilkinson and the dark horse Eddie in How I Live Now. George received several nominations and for such features and later bought home a total of 5 awards. George had a stint in the West End in 2014 in The Cement Garden. He portrayed Joe in the well-received Pride and Duane Hopkins' Bypass premiered at the BFI London Film Festival in October. Both Captain Fantastic and Sadie Jones' The Outcast are in post-production and George will be returning to theatre for Eugene O'Neill's 'Ah,Wilderness!' this April. In 2016, George starred in the film Captain Fantastic (2016), opposite Viggo Mortensen, and the mini-series 11.22.63 (2016), with James Franco and Sarah Gadon.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MjAwNTU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ3NjgzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1126657","name":"George MacKay","idIMDB":"nm1126657"},"actorId":"nm1126657","character":"Joe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0511523","main":true},{"actorName":"Monica Dolan","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230826","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA3NTk3MzkxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE1NzkyMg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"15 March 1969","placeOfBirth":" Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, England, UK","bio":"Monica was born in March 1969 into an Irish family and has a sister Gabrielle. She studied drama at the Guildhall School in London, graduating in 1991 and soon afterwards went into television. A supremely versatile character actress she has tended to specialize in stunning portrayals of the darker side of life, as real-life stalker Maria Marchese in 'U Be Dead', demure but deadly Miss Gilchrist in the superior Poirot adaptation 'After the Funeral' and, particularly, as serial killer Rosemary West in 'Appropriate Adult' for which she, along with fellow Guildhall graduate Dominic West, deservedly received a BAFTA award. Therefore it was rather a surprise when she was not the killer in an episode of 'Midsomer Murders' though she sort of made up for it playing twin sisters, one nice, one less so, in 'Call the Midwife'. On stage she has not let the villainous side down as Regan in 'King Lear' with Ian McKellen and an unusual version of 'Macbeth', set in Africa, with her Lady Macbeth the only white protagonist. In 2014 despite a lighter role in the TV sitcom ' W1A' she was back to being enjoyably horrid as George Mackay's bigoted mother in the film 'Pride'.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA3NTk3MzkxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE1NzkyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0230826","name":"Monica Dolan","idIMDB":"nm0230826"},"actorId":"nm0230826","character":"Marion","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew Flynn","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1766456","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDM0Mzk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzODU1OTE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Matthew Flynn is an actor, known for Pride (2014), Sahara (2005) and Dark World (2008).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDM0Mzk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzODU1OTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1766456","name":"Matthew Flynn","idIMDB":"nm1766456"},"actorId":"nm1766456","character":"Tony","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrew Scott","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0778831","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjI2NTc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM5NjY4Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"21 October 1976","placeOfBirth":" Dublin, Ireland","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Andrew Scott grew up in Dublin, Ireland with an older and a younger sister, Sarah and Hannah. His father, Jim, worked in the Fas government employment agency, and his mother, Nora, taught art at a secondary school. Andrew attended Gonzaga, a Jesuit school for boys on the south side of Dublin. From the age of 8 he took drama classes for children on Saturdays at the Anne Kavanagh school, and then in his early twenties he helped tutor younger students. He made two commercials for Irish television, for Flahavan's Porridge and Disney/Fanta. At 17 Andrew starred in his first professional role in the 1994 Irish drama \"Korea.\" Later that year, he matriculated into Trinity College in Dublin to begin a degree in drama, but left after six months. He went on to perform at the Abbey Theatre, the national theater of Ireland, in four plays. In early 2000 Scott moved to London for a supporting role in \"Longitude,\" a multi-part television movie starring Michael Gambon. Scott played many roles on the stage and received two Olivier awards. In 2006, Scott made his Broadway debut in David Hare's \"The Vertical Hour\" starring with Bill Nighy and Julianne Moore. He was nominated for a Drama League award for his role. Occasional film and television work in Britain, Ireland and America interspersed his stage career. Most notable of these was \"Band of Brothers,\" \"John Adams,\" and the television comedy series, \"My Life in Film.\" \"Sherlock,\" a modern-day revamp of the classic stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for BBC Television proved to be a turning point in Scott's career in 2010 when he gained notice as Moriarty, the fictional detective's nemesis. Scott starred in the play, \"Birdland\" by Simon Stephens, in the spring of 2014, where he played the role of a jaded rock star contemplating the meaning of fame. His film work stepped up considerably with roles in several important movies including 20th Century Fox's James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe starrer, \"Frankenstein\" released in 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjI2NTc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM5NjY4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0778831","name":"Andrew Scott","idIMDB":"nm0778831"},"actorId":"nm0778831","character":"Gethin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0402498","main":true},{"actorName":"Joseph Gilgun","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0318543","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE0OTM4ODIxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ4MDYxNw@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 March 1984","placeOfBirth":" Chorley, Lancashire, England, UK","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Joseph Gilgun was born on March 9, 1984 in Chorley, Lancashire, England.
