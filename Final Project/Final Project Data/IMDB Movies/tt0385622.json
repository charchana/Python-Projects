Starring in one of the most highly-anticipated new dramas with History Channel's military series; Six (2017), is an ambitious drama that follows Navy SEAL Team Six, the best of the best whose mission to eliminate a Taliban leader in Afghanistan goes awry when they uncover a U.S. citizen working as a jihadist fighter with the terrorists. Brianne jumps off the screen as \"Lena\", a teacher and wife of lead SEAL Team Six commander \"Joe Graves\" (Sloane). As the pillar of her family and heart of the series, \"Lena\" leads her family with strength and dignity, as her husband leaves for weeks at a time to complete the world's most dangerous military operations, while she is never quite sure if he will return to her alive. Brianne was first discovered, at the young age of 12, by an agency that hooked her up with modeling jobs and, soon after, began booking commercial work. Her first taste of acting was after she booked a small speaking role in the widely successful movie, Remember the Titans (2000), starring an all-star cast that included Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Hayden Panettiere, Ryan Gosling and Kate Bosworth, just to name a few. From there, Brianne went on to star in the hit television show, CW's Dawson's Creek (1998), and once graduating from high school, she made the decision to move to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career. Once in LA, Brianne began booking roles in many hit shows, including FX's Nip/Tuck (2003), CBS' CSI: Miami (2002), ABC's Desperate Housewives (2004) and HBO's True Blood (2008). Davis has also proved her talent as a big screen actress. Her first lead role came in 2005 with the blockbuster hit Jarhead (2005), a drama centered on the life of U.S. marine sniper Anthony Swofford, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, during the Gulf War who struggles to cope with being away from home and fears that his girlfriend, played by Brianne, was cheating on him while he was away. She also starred in the horror film, Prom Night (2008), alongside Brittany Snow, Kellan Lutz and Idris Elba, as the flick's somewhat comedic relief. Not only is an actor, Brianne also an accomplished director and producer. Thriving behind the camera, as much as in front, she has produced five films with her production company \"Give & Take Productions\", and has directed three features: The Night Visitor 2: Heather's Story (2016), Psychophonia (2016) and Transfer. When not in front of the camera, or in the director's chair, Brianne's undeniable passion is in supporting our troops. She can often be found traveling the world on various USO tours and so far has visited 15 bases. While on tour, she has stayed in such places as Iraq and Afghanistan. Stateside, Brianne champions on behalf of veteran programs, especially in getting the necessary post traumatic stress relief that many soldiers desperately need. This is absolutely something she holds near and dear to her heart. Brianne also helps support the homeless, animal shelters, and volunteering around Los Angeles.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDVlMDI3MmYtMTYyNi00ZGUxLTlkNWUtMTFlMDQ4MDk3ZWY2L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc2MDkzNzg@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1732403","name":"Brianne Davis","idIMDB":"nm1732403"},"actorId":"nm1732403","character":"Rochelle Davis","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kevin Dobson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004878","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMjk2MDg2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NjkzOTE@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 March 1943","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Kevin Patrick Dobson","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Kevin Dobson was born on March 18, 1943 in New York City, New York, USA as Kevin Patrick Dobson.

Born in the state of New Jersey on October 15, 1973, Paul Logan attended SUNY Purchase (State University of New York) completing a degree study in bio-chemistry before moving to Los Angeles to study Chiropratic at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic. Logan's career in acting began after deciding to pursue it full-time. In 1996, Paul Logan embarked on his new career path. After a few small parts on a few early films and television episodes, Logan gained better screen time with the movie Killers (1997). He notched several other credits to his performing belt through the course of the 1990s and into the 21st century. In the mid 2000s, Paul Logan worked in several fantasy, Sci-Fi and/or creature films. The first of these was The Curse of the Komodo (2004) followed by the supernatural horror film Way of the Vampire (2005) in which he starred as Dracula. Next he appeared in the creature/horror film Komodo vs. Cobra (2005). From 2001-2005, Logan appeared on Days of Our Lives (1965) as a recurring character. Between 2009 and 2010, Logan worked with small-budget TV/direct-to-video production company The Asylum. His first project with that company was the 2009 disaster thriller MegaFault (2009) (starring the late Brittany Murphy ). Logan's second project that same year was in the Sci-Fi \"man vs machine\" film The Terminators (2009). His third film with The Asylum saw him in a leading role as the US commando sent to South America to stop mutating killer-fish in the SyFy original Mega Piranha (2010). His athletic background came in handy for the martial art-styled action film Ballistica (2009), again with a leading role as a top-notch CIA agent trained in the title art of Ballistica (hand-to-hand combat with firearms). As a highly-versatile athlete, Logan is experienced in most sports, including football, baseball, swimming and boxing.
