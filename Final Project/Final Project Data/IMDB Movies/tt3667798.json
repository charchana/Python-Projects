With both of her parents' family names Yang, she was named Mi which means the mathematical term 'power' in Chinese. Her audiences are usually attracted by her waterish huge eyes and pale alabaster skin. While she is still young in moviedom, she began her career at the age of 4. In 1990, historical drama director Jialin Chen found Yang's talent in acting and offered her a role in the TV series Tang Ming Emperor as the little princess. Then, in the same year, she showed her face in the comedy superstar Stephen Chow's movie Wu zhuangyuan Su Qi-er as Chow's daughter. In the next few years, she accepted some roles in certain TV series and quit performance for about 10 years. However, she had little memories about her performing experiences in childhood. Yang had an innocent time in her teens and developed hobbies of drawing and writing poems. At 17, when still in high school, she came back to moviedom as a professional. In 2004, she played the role of 'Guo Xiang' (also as the little devil from the east), a girl of simplicity, in the TV series Return of the Condor Heroes (also as Shen Diao Xia Lu) adapted from a famous Chinese swordsmen novel. This role left a very deep impression on audiences and established her career in TV. Without much sensationalization, Yang likes living in a natural way, talking straightforward and hiding no emotions, which leaves her few scandals in her tracks. She entered Performance Institute of Beijing Film Academy in the next year. In 2007, Yang re-cooperated with director Jialin Chen and acted as Zhaojun Wang, entitled as one of the ancient China's 'Four Beauties' involved in political struggles legendarily, in the TV that has a homonym. Her turning point in performing career was the radiant role as a naughty and spoiled noble girl in the TV Chinese Paladin III (2009) (also as Xian Jian Qi Xia Zhuan III), which has won her a positive public reputation. In another blockbuster TV Hong Lou Meng (2009) (also as A Dream of the Red mansions) which was adapted from the homonymous novel that symbolizes the highest achievement in Chinese novel literature, Yang acted as a servant girl, Qingwen, who dares to fight against fate and feudal rules, which is a significant role in the book.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MTc2MzE4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM5MDMwMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2468729","name":"Mi Yang","nicknames":["Xiaomi","Mimi","Little fox"],"idIMDB":"nm2468729"},"actorId":"nm2468729","character":"XiaoChun Ye","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Zihan Ji","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6505678","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 October 2007","placeOfBirth":" Beijing, China","bio":"Zihan Ji was born on October 19, 2007 in Beijing, China.
