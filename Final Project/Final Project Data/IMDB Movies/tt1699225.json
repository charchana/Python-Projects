By the time she had reached her preteens Nicki was performing Beethoven for audiences all around Oklahoma, until her family had a huge financial setback and was forced to sell her piano. Nicki has said that this sad circumstance played a major role in her shift to the theater. Like a lot of kids her age she began performing in her high school theater, and also in drama competitions. She won state titles in different categories, and became very comfortable with being in front of an audience. She once said that she was on stage long before she ever actually sat in an audience. After high school graduation she attended the University of Oklahoma and began serious academic study. Soon, however, she found herself driving to California to enroll in the theater department at Long Beach State. While working two jobs and participating in the theater department, Nicki found little time to study and take a full class load. In her second year at Long Beach State Nicki was able to sign with a small agency in Hollywood, and thus began her career as a professional performer - a career which began relatively quickly compared to most. She was working small bit parts on several popular networks and shows within a year of making the move from Oklahoma to Los Angeles. In the beginning of her career Nicki acted opposite actor Stephen Rae in an HBO film called \"Double Tap\", as well as appearing in shows like \"Third Rock from the Sun\", NBC's \"Providence\", David Kelley's \"Ally McBeal\", and in the X-Files episode \"Rush\" in 1999. That role from the TV show lead to a role in the second \"X-Files\" film \"I Want to Believe\" in 2008. In a time when an unspoken difference between \"film\" actors and \"television\" actors existed, Aycox did not allow this rule to apply to her. Her work during these early years has included guest spots on \"CSI\", and \"Dark Angel\", a recurring role n NBC's \"ED\" playing the wild and crazy sister of Julie Bowen. At some points Nicki would be pulling double duty playing roles on different shows. She played the sister of Katherine Morris on CBS's \"Cold Case\", while shooting the series \"LAX\" with Heather Locklear. By 2005, Aycox was made a series regular on shows such as FX's \"Over There\" created by Steven Bochco and Chris Gerolmo. She moved on from there to play a very memorable role as a psychotic serial killer in an episode of \"Criminal Minds\" titled \"The Perfect Switch\". The following year Nicki appeared in the Halle Berry film \"Perfect Stranger\". One of her most widely known roles has been that of Meg Masters in \"Supernatural\". In the years 2009-2013 Aycox enjoyed success as a series regular as Jamie Allen in the Bruckheimer series \"Dark Blue\". Next she was cast as Lisa Matthews in the Indie film \"Lifted\", directed by Oscar nominated director Lexi Alexander. Around this time she also awarded a best actress award by the Buffalo Niagara film festival for her portrayal as a German woman fighting to save her sanity in the World War II film \"Christina\". Her co-star, Stephen Lang, was also awarded for his role as Inspector Reinheart. Today Aycox has reclaimed her love of music, playing the guitar and singing for audiences, as well as continuing her acting career. She lives on both the East and West coasts.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA2NTk2MDAzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE5OTUwOTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0043704","name":"Nicki Aycox","idIMDB":"nm0043704"},"actorId":"nm0043704","character":"Candy","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kiersten Warren","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0912916","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwOTY5ODExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjExMDAz._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 November 1965","placeOfBirth":" Iowa, USA","birthName":"Kiersten Nicolla Dale Warren","bio":"Kiersten Nicolla Dale Warren was born on November 4, 1965 in Iowa.

After modeling for four years in Tokyo for the likes of Kanebo Cosmetics, Fuji Film and Mr. Donut (formerly Happy Fun Sunshine Donut), Kiersten set her sights on acting. Starting with her on-screen debut in 1987, opposite Tom Selleck, in the Magnum, P.I.

In 2006, her fragile/ferocious portrayal as Nora Huntington, the homewrecking, pot-stirring single mother on Desperate Housewives (2004), who saw the business end of a tragedy in the episode \"Bang\", helped bring in the highest ratings in the series' history since its premiere.

Educated at prep-school, he first made a serious commitment to his craft during his days at Pennsylvania's Franklin and Marshall College. Working summers with the nearby Fulton Repertory Theatre at Lancaster in the heart of Amish country, Williams performed the classics as well as contemporary dramas and musicals. After graduating, Williams--whose first name, incidentally, is a family surname on his mother's side--headed for Manhattan where he understudied the Danny Zuko role in \"Grease.\" After working in the The Andrews Sisters musical \"Over Here,\" he made his film debut as a cop in Deadly Hero (1975), then returned to \"Grease,\" this time in the starring role. While he took leaves for two small film roles, in The Ritz (1976) and The Eagle Has Landed (1976), it was his stage work in \"Grease\" that led to his cinematic breakthrough in Hair (1979). Spotted by director Milos Forman, Williams was asked to read for the role of Berger, the hippie. It took 13 auditions to land the part, but the film's release catapulted Williams into stardom. He then portrayed a GI on the make in Steven Spielberg's 1941 (1979) and starred in the romantic comedy Why Would I Lie? (1980) before tackling the role of Danny Ciello, the disillusioned New York City cop who blew the whistle on his corrupt colleagues in Sidney Lumet's Prince of the City (1981). He followed that with The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper (1981), in which he played the legendary plane hijacker who successfully eluded capture (by Robert Duvall); Flashpoint (1984), in which he and Kris Kristofferson starred as a pair of maverick border patrolmen who come upon a large cache of stolen money; Sergio Leone's Il était une fois en Amérique (1984), in which he played a Jimmy Hoffa-like labor organizer; and Smooth Talk (1985), a screen adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates' short story, \"Where Are You Going?\" Television viewers have seen Williams in a prestigious pair of dramas, Dempsey (1983), a three-hour story of the hard-living heavyweight champ, and John Erman's adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" which pitted Williams' Stanley Kowalski against Ann-Margret's Blanche Dubois. Williams has also returned to Broadway sporadically -- first to appear in \"Once in a Lifetime\" while filming \"Hair,\" and in 1981 to play the role of the pirate king in \"The Pirates of Penzance.\"","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MzcwOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc3NTA3MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001852","name":"Treat Williams","idIMDB":"nm0001852"},"actorId":"nm0001852","character":"Dr. Warren","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Liam McKanna","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4030791","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Liam McKanna is an actor, known for Beyond the Blackboard (2011), Between the Forest and the Field (2012) and Duke (2013).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4030791","name":"Liam McKanna","idIMDB":"nm4030791"},"actorId":"nm4030791","character":"Danny","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Paola Andino","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4005194","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNhY2JjM2MtN2EwYy00ZTVhLWEzOGItODNkMzY0NzY0NmJmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM2NDkxNDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 3½\" (1.61 m)","bio":"Paola Andino was born in Bayamón, Puerto Rico and moved to Dallas, Texas a few months shy of her 3rd birthday.
