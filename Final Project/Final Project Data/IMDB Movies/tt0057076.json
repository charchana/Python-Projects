In 1988, Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Untouchables (1987). His film career also includes such films as Marnie (1964), The Name of the Rose (1986), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Highlander (1986), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), DragonHeart (1996) and The Rock (1996). Connery has been polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted \"Sexiest Man of the Century\". Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Euphemia McBain (née McLean), was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He has a brother, Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves. No Road Back (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it followed by several Tv-movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) and guest appearances on TV-series, and also films such as Hell Drivers (1957), Another Time, Another Place (1958), Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), The Frightened City (1961). In 1962 he appeared in The Longest Day (1962) with a host of other stars. Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. He played the character in the first five Bond films: Dr. No (1962), From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), and You Only Live Twice (1967) - then appeared again as Bond in Diamonds Are Forever (1971) and Never Say Never Again (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, \"He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks\", and \"I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man,\" adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2\", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming's girlfriend told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful Dr. No (1962) premiere. He was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels. Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film. During the filming of Thunderball (1965), Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately. Connery was forced to wear a toupee during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 17. This didn't prevent Connery from being cast in roles, although it became more noticeable in his later years. In 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled From Russia with Love (2005), which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast. After and during the success of the Bond-films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964), The Hill (1965), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), The Wind and the Lion (1975), Time Bandits (1981), Highlander (1986), The Name of the Rose (1986), The Untouchables (1987) (which earned him an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Rising Sun (1993), The Rock (1996), Finding Forrester (2000), and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963, he followed in his father's footsteps and also became an actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, they have no children together. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and his ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Quinn Connery, in 1997.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcwNTM4MzctYjQzMi00NTA2LTljYWItNTYzNmE1MTYxN2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125","name":"Sean Connery","nicknames":["Big Tam"],"idIMDB":"nm0000125"},"actorId":"nm0000125","character":"James Bond","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000007","main":true},{"actorName":"Daniela Bianchi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000938","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMTI2NzkyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI4MDgzNA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"31 January 1942","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Daniela Bianchi is an Italian actress, best known for her role of Bond girl Tatiana Romanova in From Russia with Love (1963).

His uncle Francisco took charge of his education, and young Pedro went to the Polytechnic Institute of San Luis Obispo, California. There, he studied business and journalism. He graduated in 1931 and returned to Mexico City where he found work as a railroad employee, insurance salesman and tourist guide. He was discovered by director Miguel Zacarías when Armendáriz was reciting Hamlet's monologue (to be or not to be) to an American tourist in a cafeteria. After that, Armendáriz began a brilliant career in Mexico, the United States and Europe. Together with Dolores del Rio and Emilio Fernández, Armendáriz made many of the greatest films in the so-called Mexican Cinema Golden Era: L'ouragan (1943), Bugambilla (1945), Maria Candelaria (1944), among others. He was considered a prototype of masculinity and male beauty. His green eyes and almost perfect features made him perfectly cast in any role he made. But it was his passion, force and acting abilities, combined with his quality of a gentleman what made him an instant favorite of great directors like John Ford, international costars like María Félix, Sean Connery or Susan Hayward, and his fans in Mexico and other countries.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwMjE2MjA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA0MjYwOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000784","name":"Pedro Armendáriz","nicknames":["Pete","The Clark Gable of Mexico"],"idIMDB":"nm0000784"},"actorId":"nm0000784","character":"Kerim Bey","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000388","main":true},{"actorName":"Lotte Lenya","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0502322","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNTQwMzg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4MDgzNA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 October 1898","placeOfBirth":" Vienna-Penzing, Austria-Hungary [now Austria]","birthName":"Karoline Wilhelmine Charlotte Blamauer","bio":"Lotte Lenya was a Tony Award-winning and Academy award-nominated actress and singer who is best remembered for her supporting role as Rosa Klebb in the classic Bond film From Russia with Love (1963). She was born Karoline Wilhelmine Charlotte Blaumauer on October 18, 1898, in Vienna, Austria (at that time Austro-Hungarian Empire), into a working class family. Young Lenya was fond of dancing. In 1914 she moved to Zurich, Switzerland. There she began using her stage name, Lotte Lenya. In Swizerland she studied classical dance, singing and acting and made her stage debut at the Schauspielhaus. In 1921 she moved to Berlin and blended in the city's cosmopolitan cultural milieu. In 1924 she met composer Kurt Weill, and they married in 1926. Lotte Lenya was the inspiration behind Weill's most popular hit 'Mack the Knife'. She performed in several productions of 'The Threepenny Opera', which became an important step in her acting career. In 1933, with the rise of Nazism in Germany, Lotte Lenya escaped from the country. At the same time, being stressed by the circumstances of life, she divorced from Kurt Weil, to be reunited with him two years later. In 1935 both emigrated to the United States and remarried in 1937. After Kurt Weill's death, she dedicated her efforts to keeping Weill's music played in numerous productions worldwide. In 1957 she won a Tony award for her role as Jenny, performed in English, in a Broadway production of 'The Threepenny Opera'. Lotte Lenya shot to international fame with her portrayal of Contessa Magda Terbilli-Gozales, Vivien Leigh's friend in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1961). The role brought Lenya an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress. She gained additional fame after she appeared as Rosa Klebb, former head of operations for SMERSH/KGB, and now a sadistic Spectre agent with poisonous knife in her shoe, in From Russia with Love (1963). She died of cancer on November 27, 1981, in New York. She is entombed with Kurt Weill in a mausoleum, in Mount Repose Cemetery, in Haverstraw, New York, USA.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNTQwMzg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4MDgzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0502322","name":"Lotte Lenya","idIMDB":"nm0502322"},"actorId":"nm0502322","character":"Rosa Klebb","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000398","main":true},{"actorName":"Robert Shaw","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001727","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NzI3NTU2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUzMjkyOA@@._V1_UY44_CR4,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 August 1927","placeOfBirth":" Westhoughton, Lancashire, England, UK","birthName":"Robert Archibald Shaw","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Robert Archibald Shaw was born on August 9, 1927 in Westhoughton, Lancashire, England, the eldest son of Doreen Nora (Avery), a nurse, and Thomas Archibald Shaw, a doctor. His paternal grandfather was Scottish, from Argyll. Shaw's mother, who was born in Piggs Peak, Swaziland, met his father while she was a nurse at a hospital in Truro, Cornwall. His father was an alcoholic and a manic depressive; he committed suicide when Robert was only 12. He had three sisters, Elisabeth, Joanna and Wendy and one brother, Alexander. As a boy, he attended school in Truro and was quite an athlete, competing in rugby, squash and track events but turned down an offer for a scholarship at 17 to go to London with furthering education in Cambridge as he did not want a career in medicine but luckily for the rest of us, in acting. He was also inspired by one of the schoolmasters, Cyril Wilkes who got him to read just about everything, including all of the classics. He would take three or four of the boys to London to see plays. The first play Robert would ever see was \"Hamlet\" in 1944 with Sir John Gielgud at the Haymarket. Robert went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts with a £1,000 inheritance from his grandmother. He went on from the Academy, after two years (1946-1948) to Stratford-on-Avon, where he was directed by Gielgud who said to Shaw, \"I do admire you and think you've got a lot of ability, and I'd like to help you, but you make me so nervous.\" He then went on to make his professional stage debut in 1949 and tour Australia in the same year with the Old Vic. He had joined the Old Vic at the invitation of Tyrone Guthrie, who had directed him as the Duke of Suffolk in \"Henry VIII\" at Stratford. He played nothing but lesser Shakespearean roles, Cassio in \"Othello\" and Lysander in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and toured Europe and South Africa with the company. Shaw was sold on Shakespeare and thought that it would be his theatrical life at that stage. He was discovered whilst performing in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" in 1950 at Stratford by Sir Alec Guinness who suggested he come to London to do Hamlet with him. He then went on to his first film role, a very small part in the classic The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) with Guinness but a start nonetheless. It was also at this time that he married his first wife, Jennifer Bourne, an actress he had met while working at the Old Vic and married her in Sallsbury, South Rhodesia on August 1, 1952. Together, they would have four daughters, Deborah, Penny, Rachel and Katherine. He would also appear briefly in The Dam Busters (1955) and did the London production of \"Tiger at the Gates\" in June of 1955 as Topman. He would also make \"Hill in Korea\" around this time and then, after taking on several jobs as a struggling actor and to support his growing family, he would be cast as Dan Tempest in The Buccaneers (1956). Shaw did not take his role seriously but made £10,000 for eight months work. It was around this time that he wrote his first novel, \"The Hiding Place.\" It was a success, selling twelve thousand copies in England and about the same in France and in the United States. He also wrote a dramatization of it that was produced on commercial television in England and Playhouse 90 (1956) aired a different dramatization in America. Around 1959, he became involved with the well-known actress Mary Ure, who was married to the actor John Osborne at the time. He slipped her his telephone number one night at 3:00 a.m. while visiting the couple and she called him the next day. It was around this time, in 1960, that Robert Shaw became a reporter for England's Queen magazine and covered the Olympics in Rome. Shaw and Ure acted together in Middleton's The Changeling at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 1961. He was playing the part of an ugly servant in love with the mistress of the house who persuades him to murder her fiance. Shaw and Ure had a child on August 31st, even though they were still married to their other spouses. His wife Jennifer and Ure had children to him only weeks apart from each other. Mary divorced Osborne and married Shaw in April 1963. The couple was often quoted by the press as being, \"very much in love\" and together, they would have four children together; Colin, Elizabeth, Hannah and Ian. That same year, after making the next two films, Alerte sur le Vaillant (1962) and The Guest (1963), he made From Russia with Love (1963) and was unforgettable as the blonde assassin, Donald 'Red' Grant. He also made Tomorrow at Ten (1963), as well as TV version of Hamlet as Claudius. He would then film The Luck of Ginger Coffey (1964) with Ure and then star in Battle of the Bulge (1965) as the German Panzer commander Hessler. He wrote \"The Flag\" on the set of the film . He was nominated for his next role, as Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons (1966), an outstanding, unequal led performance. He would write his fourth novel \"The Man in the Glass Booth\", which was later made into a play with Donald Pleasence and later into a film with Maximilian Schell. In 1967, he again starred with his wife in Custer of the West (1967), then on to The Birthday Party (1969) and Battle of Britain (1969). One of his best performances of this decade was also as the Spanish conqueror Pizarro in The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1969). His last published novel, \"A Card from Morocco\" was also a big success and he went on to make Figures in a Landscape (1970) with Malcolm McDowell as two escaped convicts in a Latin American country. As the father of Churchill in Young Winston (1972) he was once again his brilliant self, and stole the scene from John Mills, Patrick Magee, Anthony Hopkins and Ian Holm. After his portrayal of Lord Randolph Churchill, he made A Reflection of Fear (1972), a horror movie with Ure, Sondra Locke and Sally Kellerman. As the chauffeur Steven Ledbetter in The Hireling (1973) he falls in love with Sarah Miles, an aristocratic widow he helps recover from a nervous breakdown. It took the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and was quite a thought provoking film. It was his performances in the following two films, the USA produced The Sting (1973) and The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) that Shaw became familiar once again to American audiences but it is his portrayal as a grizzled Irish shark hunter, named Quint, in Jaws (1975) that everyone remembers, even to this day. Hard to believe that Shaw wasn't that impressed with the script and even confided to a friend, Hector Elizondo, \"They want me to do a movie about this big fish. I don't know if I should do it or not.\" When Elizondo asked why Shaw had reservations he mentioned that he'd never heard of the director and didn't like the title, \"JAWS.\" It is also incredible that as the biggest box office film, which was the first movie to gross more than $100 million worldwide, he had ever been part of, he didn't make a cent from it because of the taxes he had to pay from working in the United States, Canada and Ireland. It was also during this time that he became a depressed recluse following the death of his wife who took an accidental overdose of barbiturates and alcohol. Some have speculated throughout the years that her death was suicidal but there was no reason for it and this is mere sensationalism. Following Diamonds (1975) he made End of the Game (1975), then another brilliant performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin and Marian (1976). During the same year, he also made Swashbuckler (1976) with Geneviève Bujold and James Earl Jones, a very light-hearted pirate adventure. His next film Black Sunday (1977), with Shaw playing an Israeli counter-terrorist agent trying to stop a terrorist organization, called Black September, which is plotting an attack at the Super Bowl, was a big success both with critics and at the box office. I wasn't surprised considering the depth that he was also involved in writing the script although he didn't receive billing for it. Shaw was very happy with the success of his acting career, but he remained a depressed recluse in his personal life until he finished Black Sunday (1977) when he found himself in love with his secretary of 15 years, Virginia Dewitt Jansen (Jay). They were wed on July 29, 1976 in Hamilton, Bermuda. He adopted her son Charles and the couple also had one son, Thomas. During his stay in Bermuda, Shaw began work on his next movie, The Deep (1977) which teamed him and writer Peter Benchley once again and maybe that was a mistake, in that everyone expected another Jaws (1975). At one point, discussing how bad the film was going, Shaw could be quoted as saying to Nick Nolte, \"It's a treasure picture Nick, it's a treasure picture\". It did well at the box office but not with critics, although they did hail Shaw as the saving grace. He had done it for the money, as he was to do with his next film, for he had decided when Ure had died that life was short and that he needed to provide for his ten children. In 1977, Shaw traveled to Yugoslavia where he starred in Force 10 from Navarone (1978), a sequel to The Guns of Navarone (1961), he revived the lead role of the British MI6 agent Mallory originally played by Gregory Peck. He was a big box office draw and some producers were willing to pay top wages for his work, but he felt restricted by the parts he was being offered. \"I have it in mind to stop making these big-budget extravaganzas, to change my pattern of life. I wanted to prove, I think, that I could be an international movie star. Now that I've done it, I see the valuelessness of it.\" In early 1978, Shaw appeared in Avalanche Express (1979) which was to become his last film in which he played General Marenkov, a senior Russian official who decides to defect to the west and reveals to a CIA agent, played by Lee Marvin, that the Russians are trying to develop biological weapons. An alcoholic most of his life, Shaw died, before the film was completed, of a heart attack at the age of 51 on August 28, 1978. In poor health due to alcoholism during most of the filming, he in fact completed over 90% of his scenes before the death of director Mark Robson two months earlier in June 1978 brought production to a halt. While living in Ireland and taking a hiatus from working, Shaw was driving from Castlebar to his home in Tourmakeady, Ireland with wife, Virginia, and young son, Thomas, after spending the day playing golf with friends on a local course as well as shopping with her in the town. As they approached their cottage, he felt chest pains which he claimed to Virginia that they had started earlier that day while he was playing golf but the pains subsided. He pulled the car over a few hundred yards from his cottage and told her he would get out and walk them off. After taking four or five steps from the parked car, he collapsed by the side of the road in which his wife ran to the cottage to phone for help. An ambulance arrived 15 minutes later where Shaw was taken to Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar where he was pronounced dead on arrival.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NzI3NTU2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUzMjkyOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001727","name":"Robert Shaw","idIMDB":"nm0001727"},"actorId":"nm0001727","character":"Grant","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000322","main":true},{"actorName":"Bernard Lee","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496866","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NTc3MTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM5NjU2._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 January 1908","placeOfBirth":" Brentford, Middlesex, England, UK","birthName":"John Bernard Lee","height":"6' 0½\" (1.84 m)","bio":"Best remembered as 'M' in the James Bond films, Bernard Lee was a popular character player in British films throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Born into a theatrical family, he made his stage debut at age six and later attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He first appeared on the West End stage in London in 1928, and continued to work in the theatre during the 1930s, taking only occasional film roles. It was only after World War II that he concentrated his efforts on the cinema, and was much in demand in British films of the 1950s as friendly authority figures, including army sergeants, police detectives or navy officers. Detectives became a particular specialty, and he played this role in more than a dozen films, including The Blue Lamp (1950), Beat the Devil (1953) and The Detective (1954). In the early 1960s, he also made regular appearances as police detectives in the The Edgar Wallace Mystery Theatre (1960) second feature series, usually as \"Inspector Meredith\". He also made memorable appearances in The Third Man (1949), Operation Disaster (1950), Glory at Sea (1952), Pursuit of the Graf Spee (1956), Dunkirk (1958) and Whistle Down the Wind (1961). He was effectively cast against type in only two films, as the union agitator in The Angry Silence (1960), and as a disgruntled civil servant who becomes a spy for the Russians in Ring of Treason (1964). In 1962, he made his first appearance as the head of the British secret service in the first James Bond film, Dr. No (1962). He went on to be featured in the next ten films in the series, appearing with Sean Connery, George Lazenby and, later, Roger Moore as Bond, and will probably be considered the definitive \"M\" by more than one generation of Bond fans.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NTc3MTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM5NjU2._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496866","name":"Bernard Lee","idIMDB":"nm0496866"},"actorId":"nm0496866","character":"'M'","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000295","main":true},{"actorName":"Eunice Gayson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0311013","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MzIxMTA0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY3MzkwOA@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 March 1931","placeOfBirth":" Purley, Surrey, England, UK","birthName":"Eunice Elizabeth Sargaison","height":"5' 4\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Eunice Gayson was born on March 17, 1931 in Purley, Surrey, England as Eunice Elizabeth Sargaison.

Although Greek, he was often cast by Hammer Film Productions as Eastern characters such as Mehemet Bey in The Mummy (1959); the High Priest of Kali in The Stranglers of Bombay (1960); and Hashmi Bey in The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb (1964).

As well as these film roles he could also be seen as the villain in numerous television series of the sixties including Danger Man; The Avengers; Doctor Who; The Champions; The Saint; and Department S. Pastellides was most prolific, however, in his voice-over work, replacing hundreds of other actors' voices (some of them very famous) in films as disparate as El Cid (1961) as \"Fañez\"; You Only Live Twice (1967) as \"Tiger Tanaka; and Doctor Zhivago (1965) as \"The Girl\"'s (the character played by Rita Tushingham) boyfriend, earning him the sobriquet \"the 'Paul Frees (I)' of Britain.\"","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0664965","name":"George Pastell","idIMDB":"nm0664965"},"actorId":"nm0664965","character":"Train Conductor","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0219414","main":true},{"actorName":"Nadja Regin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716605","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQxMzIzMDYxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU3NzAyNzE@._V1_UY44_CR21,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 December 1931","placeOfBirth":" Nis, Serbia, Yugoslavia","birthName":"Nadezda Poderegin","bio":"Nadja Regin was born on December 2, 1931 in Nis, Serbia, Yugoslavia as Nadezda Poderegin.

She allegedly once won a \"Miss Autoville\" contest and won a car only to sell it in order to move to and study acting in London. A minor break for her occurred in the James Bond film series. Director Terence Young cast her twice: she first played a gypsy girl Zora in From Russia with Love (1963) and then as the doomed spy Paula in Thunderball (1965). After playing in the well-tanned minority ranks for years, Martine finally got noticed after catfighting with Raquel Welch in One Million Years B.C. (1966), which also starred John Richardson. In 1967, she married Richardson but divorced him six years later, although she would always him the love of her life.

However, this part of his life played out for real. A member of the Polish underground, he was twice captured and interred in concentration camps. Both times he escaped. After the war, he was undecided about whether to become a doctor or an actor. His father, a painter and professor of Fine Arts, put pressure on him to become an architect. Acting won out, of course, and Vladek spent six months at the prestigious Stanislavsky School of Acting and a further four years to complete his training at the Drama Director's School. By the time he shared a dressing room with Roman Polanski on stage at the National Theatre in Warsaw, he had become one of Poland's leading actors. He was first acclaimed on screen in Andrzej Wajda's story of the Polish Resistance during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, Kanal (1957). Ironically, by his own admission, Vladek had 'not a drop of Polish blood' in him, his ethnic background being a mixture of Armenian, Scottish and Austrian. He spoke fluent French, Italian and German before ever learning English. Taking advantage of a scholarship to perfect his craft, Vladek went to England in the early 1960's and decided to stay. His limited command of English and a lack of connections forced him to take on a number of menial jobs. With his last ten pounds in his pocket, he went to Oxford to study English literature. As his English improved, he began to teach drama. Before long, his successful staging of a Russian play at the Oxford University Opera Club led to a job with the BBC as actor/director. Prompted by Sean Connery (whose then-girlfriend Diane Cilento Vladek had directed on stage), he reluctantly took the part of chess grandmaster and SPECTRE agent Kronsteen in From Russia with Love (1963), emerging as one of the most memorable of the early James Bond villains. With his cultured voice, sharp nose and piercing, hypnotic eyes, Vladek's became one of the most recognisable faces on screen in the 60's and 70's. For the most part, he was typecast in sardonic, sinister or eccentric roles, tailor-made as Central European or Soviet spies, in both episodic television (eg The Saint (1962), Secret Agent (1964)) and motion pictures (eg S*P*Y*S (1974)). Perfecting his trademark screen personae was partly down to advice from actress Bette Davis, who, according to a 1992 interview in FAB magazine, instructed him to 'narrow his eyes, lower his voice to a whisper and make long pauses'. Affecting these mannerisms served him well, even when he was not playing the bad guy. On several occasions, he appeared in films by Ken Russell, notably as the decadent sculptor Loerke, in Women in Love (1969), and as the Cecil B. DeMille caricature De Thrill, in The Boy Friend (1971). He was also the arcane, enigmatic psychiatrist Dr. Doug Jackson, in Gerry Anderson's cult sci-fi series UFO (1970) (a part he secured after having previously played a similar character in the movie Journey to the Far Side of the Sun (1969) for the same production team). In 1977, he was presented by The Dracula Society with the Hamilton Deane Award for his performance as a creepy innkeeper in an episode of the short-lived anthology series Supernatural (1977). The prize was presented to him by none other than Christopher Lee. During the latter stages of his career, Vladek revisited the stage, appearing in fringe venues in London in the title role of \"Mahler\" (1973), as Shylock in \"Variations on The Merchant of Venice\" (1977) and as Friedrich Nietzsche in \"The Eagle and the Serpent\" (1988). He also taught acting classes at the London Academy of TV and made several forays into French cinema as middle-aged men obsessed with younger women. A consummate perfectionist at his craft and one of the great European character actors, Vladek died unexpectedly in October 1992 at his home in London, aged 69.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhiMjU4MTQtZGI0MS00NDk5LWI4NGItNWQ4ODY2MjkwMjE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc4MzI2NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0792996","name":"Vladek
