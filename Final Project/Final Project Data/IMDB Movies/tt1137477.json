From there he auditioned and was selected to be part of a summer program at the University of Toronto, in conjunction with Theatre Ontario. Following the end of that program, Russell went to Los Angeles for 1 year and did some private studying and theatre performance. Once back in Toronto, Russell spent another three years at a private acting studio where he was mentored in classical studies varying from Italian Comedia, Comedy Francais to British Farce and Drama. After a short period of performing, he again returned to studying at the world renowned \"Second City\" and completed their six level program in improvisation. In 2004, Russell was one of three male actors selected from across Canada to participate in the prestigious private program, \"Women in the Directors Chair\", at the Banff Arts Centre. Russell's career has allowed him to work with various directing/acting luminaries such as; James Cameron, Paul W.S. Anderson, Peter Deluise, Sturla Gunnarson, Mario Azzopardi, James Franco, Jason Statham, Richard Dean Anderson, Henry Winkler, Lance Henriksen, Jessica Alba and many more. Russell now makes his home in Toronto.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0274819","name":"Russell Ferrier","idIMDB":"nm0274819"},"actorId":"nm0274819","character":"Sheriff Durst","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0456268","main":true},{"actorName":"Robyn Ledoux","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2826907","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Robyn Ledoux is an actress, known for Scourge (2008) and Kaya (2007).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2826907","name":"Robyn Ledoux","idIMDB":"nm2826907"},"actorId":"nm2826907","character":"Jesse","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0456267","main":true},{"actorName":"Nic Rhind","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2829048","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NDY5MTQxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk1MTcwOTE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"A native of Toronto, Nic has appeared in varied film, TV, and stage projects across Canada and as far afield as China and South Africa.
