After a chance encounter, they embark on an explosive journey of sex and murder. Perhaps as a revenge against men, perhaps as a revolt against bourgeois society, but certainly in a negation - almost joyful in its senseless violence - of all the codes of a society which has excluded, raped and humiliated them. Controversial for its violence and real sex scenes: a vividly nihilist road movie set in France.","simplePlot":"Two young women, marginalised by society, go on a destructive tour of sex and violence. Breaking norms and killing men - and shattering the complacency of polite cinema audiences.","actors":[{"actorName":"Karen Lancaume","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484189","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"19 January 1973","placeOfBirth":" Lyon, Rhône, France","birthName":"Karine Bach","height":"5' 5¾\" (1.67 m)","bio":"Born Karen Bach outside of Lyons, France, Karen Lancaume came from a wealthy family. The bi-racial beauty (French father, Moroccan mother) married at 17 while she was attending college. Even though her husband was a disc jockey and she worked weekends at a nightclub to make ends meet, the couple was soon awash in debt. They saw an opportunity to make a good amount of money quickly by performing in porn films, and in 1996 they both entered the industry. Unfortunately, the marriage didn't last past their first film together, and while her ex-husband left the porn industry, she stayed in it. She soon divided her time between making porn films in Europe and the US. She appeared in a documentary about porn performers called Exhibition 99 (1998). It was while making this film that she began to have second thoughts about her chosen career, and after appearing in the controversial mainstream film Rape Me (2000)--in which she performed hardcore sex scenes--she began to ease out of the industry, finally quitting altogether in 2002. Karen Lancaume died in Paris, France, on January 28, 2005. She committed suicide by taking an overdose of prescription drugs in her boyfriend's apartment.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484189","name":"Karen Lancaume","idIMDB":"nm0484189"},"actorId":"nm0484189","character":"Nadine","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0060749","main":true},{"actorName":"Raffaëla Anderson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027303","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 January 1976","placeOfBirth":" Montfermeil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France","height":"5' 3\" (1.6 m)","bio":"Raffaëla Anderson was born on January 8, 1976 in Montfermeil, Seine-Saint-Denis, France.
