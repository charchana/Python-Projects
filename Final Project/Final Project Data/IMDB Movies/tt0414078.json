(Harmon) and Raymond Francis Reynolds, a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Her film career began at MGM after she won a beauty contest at age 16 impersonating Betty Hutton. Reynolds wasn't a dancer until she was selected to be Gene Kelly's partner in Singin' in the Rain (1952). Not yet twenty, she was a quick study. Twelve years later, it seemed like she had been around forever. Most of her early film work was in MGM musicals, as perky, wholesome young women. She continued to use her dancing skills with stage work. She was 31 when she gave an Academy Award-nominated performance in The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964). She survived losing first husband Eddie Fisher to Elizabeth Taylor following the tragic death of Michael Todd. Her second husband, shoe magnate Harry Karl, gambled away his fortune as well as hers. With her children as well as Karl's, she had to keep working and turned to the stage. She had her own casino in Las Vegas with a home for her collection of Hollywood memorabilia until its closure in 1997. She took the time to personally write a long letter that is on display in the Judy Garland museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota and to provide that museum with replicas of Garland's costumes. The originals are in her newly-opened museum in Hollywood. Nearly all the money she makes is spent toward her goal of creating a Hollywood museum. Her collection numbers more than 3000 costumes and 46,000 square-feet worth of props and equipment. With musician/actor Eddie Fisher, she was the mother of filmmaker Todd Fisher and actress Carrie Fisher. Debbie died of a stroke on December 28, 2016, one day after the death of her daughter Carrie. She was survived by her son and granddaughter, up-and-coming actress Billie Lourd.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NTAzNzM0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY4OTY2Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001666","name":"Debbie Reynolds","nicknames":["Princess Leia's Mom","Frannie","Aba Dabba"],"idIMDB":"nm0001666"},"actorId":"nm0001666","character":"Aggie Cromwell","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0038093","main":true},{"actorName":"Judith Hoag","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387432","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc4NTkyMzQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIxMDU3NzE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"29 June 1968","placeOfBirth":" Newburyport, Massachusetts, USA","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Judith Hoag was born on June 29, 1968 in Newburyport, Massachusetts, USA.

His career spans forty years. He is a minister and songwriter as well as an actor. He performed as a student at Pine Forge Academy in Pennsylvania (from which he graduated in 1963) as a singer and as an orator, and those performances accustomed him to appearing in front of an audience. He and a classmate composed the class song. At the age of twenty-one, while working as a video engineer at ABC Television, Davis saw his first-ever Broadway show--\"Apple Tree,\" which starred Alan Alda. Davis was astounded by its humor and realism and says that is when he knew he wanted to be a performer. Within a few months he had quit his full-time job and auditioned for and won a part in the Broadway production of \"Hello Dolly.\" He won a Tony nomination for his role in the Broadway show \"Two Gentleman of Verona.\" Renee Valente saw his performance in that show, and two years later cast Davis as the star of the show \"That's My Mama,\" launching his television career. Davis's songwriting was encouraged by Gloria Jones and Judd Walden. His song \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" proved to be a major hit for the Jackson Five. In the late 1970s, his career slowed and he dabbled in drugs before experiencing a spiritual rebirth. In 1981, he left Hollywood for approximately five years while he acquired a bachelor's degree in theology and a master's degree in divinity and became a licensed minister. Not long after completing his second degree, he won the part of the minister in the sitcom \"Amen.\" Since 1991, Clifton Davis has guest-starred on several sitcoms, hosted many award shows, appeared in several films and hosted a show on TBN. In 2011, Davis returned to his theater roots, appearing in \"What My Husband Doesn't Know\", the Broadway Tour of \"Wicked\" and appeared on Broadway as Sultan in Disney's \"Aladdin\". He is also a motivational speaker who enjoys helping others and bringing hope and prosperity into their lives.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM1Mjg4MzM0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc5MTczNjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204389","name":"Clifton Davis","idIMDB":"nm0204389"},"actorId":"nm0204389","character":"Principal Flannigan","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Eliana Reyes","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1736737","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Eliana Reyes is an actress, known for Happy Feet (2006), Halloweentown High (2004) and The Journey of Allen Strange (1997).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1736737","name":"Eliana Reyes","idIMDB":"nm1736737"},"actorId":"nm1736737","character":"Cassie the Witch","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Lucas Grabeel","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1727317","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTQxMTQzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk3OTUwOA@@._V1_UY44_CR14,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 November 1984","placeOfBirth":" Springfield, Missouri, USA","birthName":"Lucas Stephen Grabeel","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Lucas Grabeel was born on November 23, 1984 in Springfield, Missouri, USA as Lucas Stephen Grabeel.
