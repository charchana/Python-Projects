He has won many awards and accolades for his various works including a B.A.F.T.A nomination. John has starred in many cool British feature films, including '31 North 62 East', 'Forty Five' and 10 Dead Men', not to mention B.A.F.T.A nominated 'Winner Takes All' which he also wrote and produced. John has had the honour of training with excellent teachers on both sides of the Atlantic including Mike Bernardin, Bathsheba Garnett, Ivana Chubbuck, Margie Haber and accent expert Bob Corff. He is currently working with John Ruskin at the Ruskin theatre (one of Sandford Meisners own teachers from the neighborhood playhouse) who he is very proud to count as a friend. In the short time he has been in the US (holds a green card EB1) he has already enjoyed success in both film and television. He particularly enjoyed the movie 'L.A Paranormal' (he played an unlikely playboy psychic) as it was shot with no scripted dialogue in the style of 'This is Spinal Tap' and relied heavily on the skills of the lead actors. In TV he enjoyed hit-man comedy series 'Hit The Big Time' which was filmed in Hollywood, Las Vegas, London and Utah. Recently he has been playing more dramatic roles, he played a veteran militia captain in the exceptional period mini series 'Courage, New Hampshire' and a dark lawyer in the movie 'A Million Dead Presidents'. John has a natural flair for comedy and in his own words has \"a love of life and loves to laugh\". He lives with his wife Stephanie in Los Angeles, California and is involved in the development and production of several feature films and TV productions including Lunchbox, Girl Samuri and Artifact Red.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ2NDI3MzIxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU0OTA3NzE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1636787","name":"John Campbell-Mac","nicknames":["JC"],"idIMDB":"nm1636787"},"actorId":"nm1636787","character":"Danny Martin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Dudikoff","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001154","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI4ODQ0MzAtZWE3Yi00Y2E5LTk3OWQtZjRmN2ZkZGYxOWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU2MzMxNg@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"8 October 1954","placeOfBirth":" Redondo Beach, California, USA","birthName":"Michael Joseph Stephen Dudikoff","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Michael Dudikoff was born on October 8, 1954 in Redondo Beach, California, USA as Michael Joseph Stephen Dudikoff.
