Her breakthrough movie role tapped into all of those qualities failing singer Blanche \"Monica\" Moran in Steve Kloves' The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) opposite brothers Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges. A few years later, Jennifer earned an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of the aspiring but hopelessly untalented actress Olive Neal in Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994). She has become well-known to filmgoers for both major studio and independent films. In Tom Shadyac's blockbuster Liar Liar (1997), she kept pace with Jim Carrey. Her steamy performance opposite Gina Gershon helped make Lana Wachowski's and Lilly Wachowski's Bound (1996) a breakout indie success at the Sundance Film Festival and then in theatrical release. It also expanded Jennifer's already significant gay and lesbian following. She successfully cultivated another fan base with the revitalization of the \"Child's Play\" horror comedy franchise. For Ronny Yu's La fiancée de Chucky (1998), the filmmakers turned to Jennifer to create the character who would spark the series in a new direction. She met the challenge and established a new horror icon in Tiffany. This Halloween, in Rogue Pictures' all-new Le fils de Chucky (2004), written and directed by series creator Don Mancini, Jennifer again takes the popular series to the next level; she stars as Tiffany and as herself, the deadly doll's favorite actress, who soon becomes an unwitting hostess in more ways than one. Jennifer's pitch-perfect voiceover work as Tiffany is not the only instance of her being able to incarnate a character from the vocal chords out. Families know her distinctive cadences from the recent Disney hits Home on the Range (2004) (in which Jennifer voiced a new-age bovine), directed by Will Finn and John Sanford; The Haunted Mansion (2003) (in which Jennifer acted from the neck up only), directed by Rob Minkoff; and the Pixar blockbuster Monsters, Inc. (2001) (voicing Mike's love interest Celia), directed by Pete Docter, David Silverman and Lee Unkrich. She began her acting career as a teenager, putting herself through the theater program at Stephens College in Missouri by winning writing competitions. She then headed to Los Angeles, California. While she continued to act on the stage (earning a Dramalogue Award for her performance in \"Vanities\"), movies and television immediately came calling for the actress with the unique voice and visage. Over the years, Jennifer has made memorable appearances on some of television's best series, including Hill Street Blues (1981) (in a recurring dramatic role), Cheers (1982), Moonlighting (1985), It's Garry Shandling's Show. (1986) and Frasier (1993). In addition, she has been a favored guest on a number of talk shows, from The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) to The Arsenio Hall Show (1989) to (currently) The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992). Those interview segments have encouraged viewers to expect the unexpected from her interplay with the host and the studio audience. Her many films over a two-decade span include Neil Jordan's High Spirits (1988), Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991), Richard Benjamin's Made in America (1993), Roger Donaldson's The Getaway (1994), Joe Pytka's Let It Ride (1989), P.J. Castellaneta's Relax... It's Just Sex (1998), Michael Radford's Dancing at the Blue Iguana (2000), Peter Bogdanovich's The Cat's Meow (2001) (in which she played Louella Parsons). Jennifer Tilly has also continued to act on the stage. She won a Theater World Award for her performance in off-Broadway's \"One Shoe Off\" and starred on Broadway in the 2001 revival of \"The Women\" (which was later taped for, and broadcast on, PBS).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxNDI2MzA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTcxOTI0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000236","name":"Jennifer Tilly","nicknames":["The Unabombshell","Jenny"],"idIMDB":"nm0000236"},"actorId":"nm0000236","character":"Miss Perry","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Judd Nelson","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000555","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3ODUwODQ5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzNzQyMg@@._V1_UY44_CR6,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 November 1959","placeOfBirth":" Portland, Maine, USA","birthName":"Judd Asher Nelson","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Born in Portland, Maine to attorney Leonard Nelson and his wife, Merle Nelson, (attorney and state assemblywoman), Judd attended St. Paul's preparatory school in Concord, New Hampshire before majoring in philosophy at the prestigious Haverford College in Pennsylvania. The acting bug bit when he went to watch a friend's audition and was obliged to audition in order to stay. He won the role. After graduation, Judd headed for New York City and the Stella Adler Conservatory where he was believable in the role as the \"street-smart Eddie Keaton\" in the comedy Making the Grade (1984). Judd's next film role was as the stodgy ROTCer, Phil Hicks, in the ensemble comedy Fandango (1985). Important and diverse roles in the brat-pack films The Breakfast Club (1985) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985) quickly followed. With his privileged upbringing, Judd could have brought the right degree of preppy-smarmyness, (ala James Spader), to any number of vapid roles, but his intense stare and dark smoldering looks gave him a hint of danger which added to his credibility in films like the Billionaire Boys Club (1987), From the Hip (1987) and New Jack City (1991). While Judd's career has been peppered with under-promoted films and poorly-written TV appearances, critics have not been overly kind to this misunderstood actor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3ODUwODQ5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUzNzQyMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000555","name":"Judd Nelson","idIMDB":"nm0000555"},"actorId":"nm0000555","character":"Ella's Dad","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jonathan Breck","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0106534","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNDkyOTcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwNjE0MQ@@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 February 1965","placeOfBirth":" Houston, Texas, USA","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Jonathan Breck was born on February 17, 1965 in Houston, Texas, USA.
