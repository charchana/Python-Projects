She is of mostly Irish, German, and French-Canadian descent. Ellen worked a number of jobs before she became an actress. At 14, she was a short-order cook at a lunch counter. After graduating from Detroit's Cass Technical High School, she went to Texas to model and then to New York as a showgirl on The Jackie Gleason Show (1952). From there, it was to Montreal as a nightclub dancer and then Broadway with her debut in \"Fair Game (1957)\". By 1963, she appeared on the TV series The Doctors (1963), but she gained notice for her role in Goodbye Charlie (1964). Ellen then took time off to study acting with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Her big break came when she was cast as the female lead in The Last Picture Show (1971). For this role, she received nominations for the Golden Globe and Academy Award. Next, she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in The King of Marvin Gardens (1972), giving a chilling performance. Then came The Exorcist (1973). Ellen was again nominated for the Golden Globe and Academy Award. In 1974, she starred in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), playing a waitress, which is a job that she well knows. For this performance, she won the Oscar as Best Actress as well as the British award for the same category. For the Golden Globe, she was nominated but lost to Marsha Mason. The same year, Ellen made history by winning a Tony Award for the Broadway play \"Same Time, Next Year\". She won praise and award nominations for the movie version of Same Time, Next Year (1978) and Resurrection (1980). \"Resurrection\" was a another great film in which she played a woman with the power to heal. Even with all these successful movies and all the awards, Ellen found that she could barely get a job in the 80s. A succession of TV movies resulting in two Emmy nominations kept Ellen going as did the series The Ellen Burstyn Show (1986). The TV movies continued through the 90s. Also in the 90s, Ellen was cast in the supporting role in such movies as The Cemetery Club (1993), How to Make an American Quilt (1995), The Baby-Sitters Club (1995) and The Spitfire Grill (1996). In addition to her acting, Burstyn was the first woman president of Actor's Equity, the actors' union, from 1982 to 1985.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MjYxMDc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU3MDIz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000995","name":"Ellen Burstyn","idIMDB":"nm0000995"},"actorId":"nm0000995","character":"Murph","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0434665","main":true},{"actorName":"Matthew McConaughey","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MDc3ODUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk2NjY4Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 November 1969","placeOfBirth":" Uvalde, Texas, USA","birthName":"Matthew David McConaughey","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"American actor and producer Matthew David McConaughey was born in Uvalde, Texas. His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Scottish, Irish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father's oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film. He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Dazed and Confused (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger. Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham's novel A Time to Kill (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry's hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew's birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998). In 1999, he starred in the comedy Edtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine. In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as Un mariage trop parfait (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Reign of Fire (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Fool's Gold (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies. That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey's career certainly reached it's prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO's True Detective (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics' Choice Award for the role. Later in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MDc3ODUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk2NjY4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190","name":"Matthew McConaughey","idIMDB":"nm0000190"},"actorId":"nm0000190","character":"Cooper","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0380172","main":true},{"actorName":"Mackenzie Foy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3237775","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDg4MDctMTZiNy00MjU0LTkyMGItNzU2ZWU0OGU0YTVlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI3NzgyNjM@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 November 2000","placeOfBirth":" USA","birthName":"Mackenzie Christine Foy","height":"5' 2½\" (1.59 m)","bio":"Mackenzie Christine Foy was born 10 November, 2000.

He was born in Rochester, New York, to Sarah Jane (Price), an actress, and Arthur Washington Lithgow III, who was both a theatrical producer and director. John's father was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, where the Anglo-American Lithgow family had lived for several generations. John moved frequently as a child, while his father founded and managed local and college theaters and Shakespeare festivals throughout the Midwest of the United States. Not until he was 16, and his father became head of the McCarter Theater in Princeton New Jersey, did the family settle down. But for John, the theater was still not a career. He won a scholarship to Harvard University, where he finally caught the acting bug (as well as found a wife). Harvard was followed by a Fulbright scholarship to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Returning from London, his rigorous dramatic training stood him in good stead, and a distinguished career on Broadway gave him one Tony Award for \"The Changing Room\", a second nomination in 1985 for \"Requiem For a Heavyweight\", and a third in 1988 for \"M. Butterfly\". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion, and in the mid 1970s, he and his wife divorced. He entered therapy, and in 1982, his life started in a new direction, the movies - he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp (1982). A second Oscar nomination followed for Terms of Endearment (1983), and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife. As the decade of the 1990s came around, he found that he was spending too much time on location, and another career move brought him to television in the hugely successful series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996). This production also played a role in bringing him back together with the son from his first marriage, Ian Lithgow, who has a regular role in the series as a dimwitted student.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMzUyNDkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMwNTU5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001475","name":"John Lithgow","nicknames":["Jiggles"],"idIMDB":"nm0001475"},"actorId":"nm0001475","character":"Donald","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0434664","main":true},{"actorName":"Timothée Chalamet","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3154303","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4OTMyMjUzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI0MzQ3NDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"height":"5' 11½\" (1.82 m)","bio":"Timothée Chalamet is an actor, known for Interstellar (2014), Men, Women & Children (2014) and Love the Coopers (2015).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4OTMyMjUzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI0MzQ3NDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3154303","name":"Timothée Chalamet","nicknames":["Teemo"],"idIMDB":"nm3154303"},"actorId":"nm3154303","character":"Tom","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0443579","main":true},{"actorName":"David Oyelowo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654648","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdiMzljMWEtZjg0ZC00ZWUzLTkxNjktMmNiMDhlOGJmNjlkL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTkyMDQ2Mw@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 April 1976","placeOfBirth":" Oxford, England, UK","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"David Oyelowo (pronounced - \"oh-yellow-oh\"), is a classically trained stage actor who has quickly become one of Hollywood's most sought-after talents.

Hathaway, a lawyer, both originally from Philadelphia. She is of mostly Irish descent, along with English, German, and French. Her first major role came in the short-lived television series Get Real (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in The Princess Diaries (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she is a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo. She also had a notable role in Nicholas Nickleby (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Ella Enchanted (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of \"Christine\" in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn't take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum. Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her \"Princess Diaries\" image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn't mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ5MTAxMDc5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0OTE4OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266","name":"Anne Hathaway","nicknames":["Annie"],"idIMDB":"nm0004266"},"actorId":"nm0004266","character":"Brand","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0434663","main":true},{"actorName":"Andrew Borba","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095960","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEyODY4NjExMjVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ5MjA3Njk@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"bio":"Andrew Borba is an actor, known for Interstellar (2014), Straight Outta Compton (2015) and Taken 3 (2014).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEyODY4NjExMjVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ5MjA3Njk@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0095960","name":"Andrew Borba","idIMDB":"nm0095960"},"actorId":"nm0095960","character":"Smith","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wes Bentley","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004747","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyOTY5OTA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM1MjM1Nw@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 September 1978","placeOfBirth":" Jonesboro, Arkansas, USA","birthName":"Wesley Cook Bentley","height":"5' 11\" (1.8 m)","bio":"Wes Bentley is an American actor who first became well-known via his role in the Oscar-winning film American Beauty (1999), in which he played the soulful, artistic next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts. He also portrayed gamemaker Seneca Crane in The Hunger Games (2012), and co-stars in Lovelace (2013) as photographer Thomas. Wesley Cook Bentley was born September 4, 1978, in Jonesboro, Arkansas, to David and Cherie Bentley, two Methodist ministers. Wes joined older brothers Jamey and Philip, and was later joined by younger brother, Patrick. Wes attended Sylvan Hills High School in Sherwood, Arkansas, where he was in the drama club. Interest in acting came from Improv Comedy. He, his brother Patrick, his best friend Damien Bunting and other close friend Josh Cowdery developed an Improv group called B(3) + C. They regularly dominated competitions in Arkansas. He then placed First in the state of Arkansas in solo acting in 1996, his senior year of high school, Second in Duet, and also regularly won for Poetry and Prose Readings. Wes appeared on-stage quite a bit in Little Rock. At The Weekend Theater, Wes played the straight son of the gay couple in a production of La Cage aux Folles. At Murry's Dinner Playhouse, Wes' plays included Oliver. At his mother's urging, Wes attended Juilliard School in New York after high school graduation. He was there only a short time but appeared in stage work like Henry IV, Part 1 and The Weavers. Wes then worked at Blockbuster and was a waiter at TGI Friday's on Long Island. Wes has stated that his most prideful venture in life was starting a soccer team from scratch at his high school and subsequently putting together a full Conference, one of Arkansas's first. Wes had no real experience in soccer before doing this. Bentley made his onscreen debut in Jonathan Demme's Beloved (1998). Following his success in American Beauty, Bentley struggled with substance abuse, which cost him his first marriage, to actress Jennifer Quanz. Although he continued to land parts in films, including that of the primary antagonist in Ghost Rider (2007) and another major role in The Game of Their Lives (2005), Bentley has publicly admitted that during most of the 2000s he only took on acting roles to earn enough money to buy drugs. Bentley did not enter a 12-step program until 2009. He has stated that he considers his sobriety to be an ongoing process. Bentley is one of the main subjects featured in the documentary My Big Break (2009), which followed him and former roommates Chad Lindberg, Brad Rowe and Greg Fawcett as they struggle to find success within the film industry. In 2010, Bentley made his professional stage debut with Nina Arianda in David Ives's award-winning play \"Venus In Fur.\" Bentley has one child with his second wife, producer Jacqui Swedberg.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTgyOTY5OTA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM1MjM1Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004747","name":"Wes Bentley","idIMDB":"nm0004747"},"actorId":"nm0004747","character":"Doyle","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0443580","main":true},{"actorName":"William Devane","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001137","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwOTE2NDIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE1MTQ2NjE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"5 September 1939","placeOfBirth":" Albany, New York, USA","birthName":"William Joseph Devane","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"William Devane, the movie and television actor, was born in Albany, New York, the son of Joseph Devane, who served as Franklin D. Roosevelt's chauffeur when he was Governor of New York. After graduating from New York City's American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he appeared on-stage. He finally made his Broadway debut in \"The Watering Place\" with Shirley Knight, a flop that lasted but one performance. (He was more successful with \"The Chinese and Dr. Fish\" during the 1970 season, which lasted three weeks. His sole Broadway directorial effort, the Vietnam War drama \"G. R. Point,\" lasted for 32 performances in 1979 and brought Michael Jeter a 1979 Theatre World Award.) He made his movie debut as a revolutionary in the independently produced In the Country (1967) and began appearing on series TV. He had a small but memorable part as the lawyer committed to free-enterprise in Robert Altman's masterpiece McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971) in 1971, but what made his reputation was his turn as President John F. Kennedy in the The Missiles of October (1974), a 1973 telefilm about the Cuban Missile Crisis. He made a bid for stardom with major roles in Alfred Hitchcock's Family Plot (1976) and John Schlesinger's Marathon Man (1976) (both 1976) and The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (1977) (1977), as well as roles in Schlesinger's Yanks (1979) and the TV adaptation of James Jones' classic barracks drama From Here to Eternity (1979). However, any chances for a successful movie career essentially were doomed by the monumental failure of Schlesinger's comedy Honky Tonk Freeway (1981), one of the great flops its time, bringing in only $2 million at the box office against a $24 million budget. Devane moved over to nighttime series TV, playing the cad Greg Sumner on the night-time soap opera Knots Landing (1979) for 10 years. Because of his resemblance to President Kennedy and his ability to master a Kennedyesque Boston accent, Devane continues to be in demand as politicians, including presidents, in such shows as The West Wing (1999), 24 (2001), and Stargate SG-1 (1997).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkwOTE2NDIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE1MTQ2NjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001137","name":"William Devane","idIMDB":"nm0001137"},"actorId":"nm0001137","character":"Williams","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Michael Caine","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 March 1933","placeOfBirth":" Rotherhithe, London, England, UK","birthName":"Maurice Joseph Micklewhite","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen Frances Marie (Burchell), a charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish-market porter. He left school at 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the years that followed he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit, \"The Long and the Short and the Tall.\" Zulu (1964), the 1964 epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-'60s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), Play Dirty (1969), Battle of Britain (1969), Too Late the Hero (1970), The Last Valley (1971) and especially Get Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command. There were some gems amongst the dross, however. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Educating Rita (1983) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999) (his second Oscar) and Last Orders (2001) have been widely acclaimed.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000323","name":"Michael Caine","idIMDB":"nm0000323"},"actorId":"nm0000323","character":"Professor Brand","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0485024","main":true},{"actorName":"David Gyasi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1408543","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1MDQ5NDc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyNDA1NzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"2 January 1980","placeOfBirth":" Hammersmith, London, England, UK","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"David Gyasi was born on January 2, 1980 in Hammersmith, London, England.
