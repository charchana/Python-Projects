His father was of Russian Jewish descent, and his maternal grandparents were Austrian Jewish immigrants. As a young boy, he became intrigued with magic tricks and playing the clarinet, two hobbies that he continues today. Allen broke into show business at 15 years when he started writing jokes for a local paper, receiving $200 a week. He later moved on to write jokes for talk shows but felt that his jokes were being wasted. His agents, Charles Joffe and Jack Rollins, convinced him to start doing stand-up and telling his own jokes. Reluctantly he agreed and, although he initially performed with such fear of the audience that he would cover his ears when they applauded his jokes, he eventually became very successful at stand-up. After performing on stage for a few years, he was approached to write a script for Warren Beatty to star in: Quoi de neuf, Pussycat? (1965) and would also have a moderate role as a character in the film. During production, Woody gave himself more and better lines and left Beatty with less compelling dialogue. Beatty inevitably quit the project and was replaced by Peter Sellers, who demanded all the best lines and more screen-time. It was from this experience that Woody realized that he could not work on a film without complete control over its production. Woody's theoretical directorial debut was in What's Up, Tiger Lily? (1966); a Japanese spy flick that he dubbed over with his own comedic dialogue about spies searching for the secret recipe for egg salad. His real directorial debut came the next year in the mockumentary Take the Money and Run (1969). He has written, directed and, more often than not, starred in about a film a year ever since, while simultaneously writing more than a dozen plays and several books of comedy. While best known for his romantic comedies Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979), Woody has made many transitions in his films throughout the years, transitioning from his \"early, funny ones\" of Bananas (1971), Love and Death (1975) and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask (1972); to his more storied and romantic comedies of Annie Hall (1977), Manhattan (1979) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986); to the Bergmanesque films of Stardust Memories (1980) and Interiors (1978); and then on to the more recent, but varied works of Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), Husbands and Wives (1992), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), _Celebrity_ and Deconstructing Harry (1997); and finally to his films of the last decade, which vary from the light comedy of Scoop (2006), to the self-destructive darkness of Match Point (2005) and, most recently, to the cinematically beautiful tale of Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Although his stories and style have changed over the years, he is regarded as one of the best filmmakers of our time because of his views on art and his mastery of filmmaking.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MjU3MTI2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgxNTE4MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000095","name":"Woody Allen","idIMDB":"nm0000095"},"actorId":"nm0000095","character":"Danny Rose","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0022263","main":true},{"actorName":"Mia Farrow","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3NjgxMzQ5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDEzNTkzMQ@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 February 1945","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Maria de Lourdes Villiers-Farrow","height":"5' 4¼\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Mia Farrow was born in Los Angeles, California, to director John Farrow and actress and Tarzan-girl Maureen O'Sullivan.

Raised in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood, the young Sandy attended public schools and participated in accelerated classes. A graduate of Brooklyn College, he spent his early years working summers in the Catskill Mountain resorts that were the breeding grounds of many Jewish comedians. Baron made his Broadway debut in \"Tchin-Tchin\" on Oct 25, 1962. His next play, Bertolt Brecht's \"Arturo Ui\" with Christopher Plummer in the title role, was a flop, lasting but eight performances in November 1963. His next appearance on the Great White Way, in the comedy \"Generation,\" was more successful, playing for over half a year in the 1965-1966 season. In 1964, Sandy -- already a seasoned Catskill comic and nightclub performer -- released a 13-track album on Roulette Records, \"The Race! Race!\" The album jacket pronounced it a \"rollicking comedy album about hate, prejudice, bigotry and other such nonsense.\" He established a national reputation that year on the television comedy series That Was the Week That Was (1964), the American version of the hit British TV show, both of which starred David Frost. He followed it up with a lead role in the TV series Hey, Landlord (1966), playing a stand-up comedian. In the 1970s, he made regular appearances on the The Mike Douglas Show (1961) and the The Merv Griffin Show (1962). Baron played Lenny Bruce in the show \"Lenny\" at Hollywood's Aquarius Theater in 1972, and eventually replaced Cliff Gorman in New York in what would prove to be his last Broadway appearance. Baron appeared as himself in Woody Allen's Broadway Danny Rose (1984), the director's homage to borscht-belt comedy. In the 1990s, he appeared as Jack Klompus, the nemesis of Jerry Seinfeld's father on the hit TV series Seinfeld (1989). He replaced Al Lewis as Grandpa Munster in the TV movie The Munsters' Scary Little Christmas (1996). His last movie appearance was in Stephen Frears' The Hi-Lo Country (1998). Sandy Baron died of emphysema on January 21, 2001 in a nursing home in Van Nuys, California. A memorial celebration was held on July 22, 2001 at Hollywood's Ivar Theater.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MTI5OTU2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI2NDE0NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056310","name":"Sandy Baron","nicknames":["Bez"],"idIMDB":"nm0056310"},"actorId":"nm0056310","character":"Sandy Baron","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Corbett Monica","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0598093","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NDc1NjQ5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk4ODgwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR3,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 June 1930","placeOfBirth":" St. Louis, Missouri, USA","bio":"Corbett Monica was born on June 1, 1930 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.
