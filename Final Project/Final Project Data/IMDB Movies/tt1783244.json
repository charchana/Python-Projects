He was going to be an engineer, but then he understood that it wasn't his calling. Alexander decided to go to a prestigious Schepkin Theater School, and managed to enter it at the first try. He made his stage debut in the Maly State Academic Theater, known for its traditions. Alexander has played a variety of theatrical roles, including Macbeth (Bagatela Theater, Poland), Vaslav Nijinsky in 'Nijinsky, God's Crazy Clown'(a play by an American playwright Glenn Blamstein), Cyrano de Bergerac, and others. He has starred in more than 20 films and TV series in Russia and Europe. In 1996, he landed the part of a noble, handsome Count Bussy D'Ambois in the popular Russian TV series, Grafinya de Monsoro (1998), based on a novel by Alexandre Dumas. The part brought him all-Russian fame. A historical epic, With Fire and Sword (1999) filmed by a cult Polish director Jerzy Hoffman where Alexander portrays a dashing Cossack chieftain Bohun, won him international acclaim. In 2000 Alexander was invited to play in a Swedish thriller The Diver (2000) where he acted opposite Klaus Maria Brandauer and 'Isabella Scorupco'. Among his recent movies is 'One June Night' (2001), made by another famous Polish director, Andrzej Wajda.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTVjNTE1MmYtMDNlYi00ZGQxLWFiNGQtYjlmYjUyOTRhYjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwOTA1MDM@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0231677","name":"Aleksandr Domogarov","idIMDB":"nm0231677"},"actorId":"nm0231677","character":"Kryshkin","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Olga Kabo","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0434085","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 January 1968","placeOfBirth":"","birthName":"Olga Igorevna Kabo","bio":"Olga Kabo was born on January 28, 1968 as Olga Igorevna Kabo.
