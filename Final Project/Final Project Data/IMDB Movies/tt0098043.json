Ever-radiant TV and film resident Susan Blakely found success on several paths she chose for herself over the years -- first as a model, then as an award-winning actress on TV and, finally, as a jewelry designer. The trim and trendy blonde also enhanced a mild stream of popular films during the 1970s and 1980s. Born in Frankfurt, Germany, she is the daughter of U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Blakely. While growing up, she traveled extensively throughout the world with her family including Korea, Hawaii and, finally, Texas. Following a year of study at the University of Texas, Susan moved to New York and managed to secure a place for herself as a high-priced magazine and TV ad model. At the same time, she was encouraged to try her hand at acting and studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Married in 1969 to lawyer and screenwriting hopeful Todd Merer, she chanced a move to Hollywood to seek her fame and fortune. Billed initially as Susie Blakely, she was cast in small, capricious, deb-like turns in such films as Savages (1972) (her debut) and The Way We Were (1973). Her first popular movie role came about surrounded by a high-and-mighty all-star cast in Irwin Allen's epic disaster The Towering Inferno (1974), as the spoiled princess-like daughter of unscrupulous skyscraper builder William Holden and wife of callous, pretty-boy opportunist Richard Chamberlain. Lightweight as the role was, Susan willingly accepted the challenge of proving herself in Hollywood as more than just another starlet with a gorgeous face. She did...and more...by earning a Golden Globe and Emmy nomination for her exceptional work as \"Julie Prescott\" in the acclaimed TV mini-series epic Rich Man, Poor Man (1976) with Peter Strauss and Nick Nolte vying for her attention. It was star-making turns for all three leads. This monumental acting opportunity kicked off a highly rewarding career in TV mini-movies, playing an array of flawed but fascinating and newsworthy ladies, including Hitler mistress Eva Braun opposite Anthony Hopkins in Le bunker (1981); tormented actress Frances Farmer in Will There Really Be a Morning? (1983); political wife Joan Bennett Kennedy in The Ted Kennedy Jr. Story (1986); and crime attorney Leslie Abramson in Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders (1994). Challenging roles continued to pour in that belied her pretty-girl image -- ranging from drug addicts to a housewife who changes into a werewolf! Less in the acting limelight these days, Susan nevertheless accomplished an award-winning turn in the low-profile film Hungry Hearts (2002), then starred on stage in the 2006 world premiere of \"Diva!\" at the La Jolla Playhouse. In recent years, she has broadened her horizons once again as a semi-precious jewelry designer...and once again she has met with great success. Divorced from her first husband in the 1970s, Susan remarried in 1982. Her present husband, media consultant, litigation and political adviser Steve Jaffe, has also reaped rewards as a film and television producer. Many of his projects have included Susan -- the afore-mentioned Frances Farmer TV biography, the TV-movie A Cry for Love (1980), and the film Russian Holiday (1992) [aka Russian Roulette]. They reside in the Beverly Hills area.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTIzMjQzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk3MTQyMDE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0086806","name":"Susan Blakely","idIMDB":"nm0086806"},"actorId":"nm0086806","character":"Alice Lundgren","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Edward Albert","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001902","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MDk5NTIzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2NzgzMQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 February 1951","placeOfBirth":" Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Edward Laurence Heimberger","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"The only son of Green Acres (1965) star Eddie Albert and Mexican actress/dancer Margo, Edward Laurence Albert managed to come out from under his father's strong shadow and make a gallant showing of his own as a gifted thespian. Born in Los Angeles on February 20, 1951, Edward's multi-cultural heritage and talented gene pool allowed him to become a man of many talents: songwriter, drummer, singer, photographer and, most importantly, activist. Growing up, he inherited an early interest in music and the performing arts. He made an auspicious film debut at the age of 14 in Violent Journey (1965) co-starring as a young runaway who teams up with a tormented Civil War veteran (Anthony Perkins), a teaming that leads to murder. A strong, mature role for such a youngster, his next film appearance wouldn't come about until seven years later. In the meantime Edward attended Oxford University and was studying psychology at UCLA when offered the breakthrough of a lifetime. Signed up to play the difficult role of blind Don Baker--played on Broadway by Keir Dullea--who yearns for freedom away from his domineering mom (Oscar winner Eileen Heckart) and finds it in the arms of a liberated lass named Jill (Goldie Hawn) in Butterflies Are Free (1972), Edward easily captured the hearts of millions with his tender, life-affirming performance. Edward walked home with the cinema's Golden Globe Award as \"Male Newcomer of the Year.\" A confident, intelligent actor with a serene handsomeness and 1000-watt smile who just happened to possess the most magnetic pale eyes this side of Meg Foster, Edward was on a seemingly strong path to film stardom. Although he never found a comparable success to \"Butterfly,\" he did follow it up with another theater comedy favorite, 40 Carats (1973), in which he had a dalliance with older actress Liv Ullmann. He also played Charlton Heston's military son in Midway (1976), followed by highly visible roles in The Domino Killings (1977) and The Greek Tycoon (1978). When film stardom did not pan out, Edward saw TV as a welcoming medium and made up for his sudden lack of star power with wonderful turns in major TV minimovies, notably The Last Convertible (1979). By the 1980s he had started making the rounds in formula low-budget action films and usually fared best when his flashy villainous side came into view. While such obvious movie titles as The House Where Evil Dwells (1982), Fist Fighter (1989), Demon Keeper (1994) and Stageghost (2000) pointed out the lack of quality in his offerings, it did provide a steady income and visibility. He also made frequent guest appearances on such shows as Falcon Crest (1981), L.A. Law (1986), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (1993) that kept him in the public eye. A solid regular as both good guy and bad guy on series TV, he gave his life (and, it seems, his paycheck) to the Beast after three seasons on Beauty and the Beast (1987) and, in contrast, played the dastardly Dr. Bennett Devlin on the daytime soap Port Charles (1997) for its first three seasons. Edward also used his vocal talents in animation involving such superhero icons as The Fantastic Four (1978), Spider-Man (1994) and \"The Power Rangers\". From his father and mother Edward developed a deep love and appreciation for the land and the diversity of cultures. As such, he divided his time between acting work and activism just as his father had done. Having owned a ranch in Malibu for over 30 years, he was a strong, positive influence and passionate spokesperson when it came to environmental and cultural affairs. In recent years he served on the California Coastal Commission and California Native American Heritage Commission. Long married to lovely British-born actress Katherine Woodville, the couple's daughter, Thais, continued the family musical tradition as a singer/songwriter for the rock group Sugar in Wartime. Following his mother's passing from brain cancer in 1985, Edward became a selfless caregiver to his aging father, who began to develop early signs of Alzheimer's disease in the 1990s. His father lived for more than a decade in declining health, dying in May 2005. In early 2005, Edward discovered he too was seriously ill after being diagnosed with lung cancer. He died surrounded by family on September 22, 2006, at the relatively young age of 55.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MDk5NTIzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2NzgzMQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001902","name":"Edward Albert","idIMDB":"nm0001902"},"actorId":"nm0001902","character":"Kurt Williams","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Wings Hauser","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0369567","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4OTQ4Nzk4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM1MTE3NA@@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"12 December 1947","placeOfBirth":" Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA","birthName":"Gerald Dwight Hauser","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Wings Hauser married his young music and filmmaking partner, actress/filmmaker Cali Lili Hauser on June 12, 2012.

After a high-school career centered in sports (his name \"Wings\" is taken from the wing-back position he played in football), he chose to lean toward the arts - acting and music (including an album of his original music for RCA) - instead of pursuing professional sports. Having descended from an artistic and talented family, this choice was a heartfelt one. Wings is the son of writer/producer/actor Dwight Hauser, who worked on (amongst many other projects) the classic \"Whistler\" radio series. Son of the beautiful Geraldine Hauser, (who was the daughter of author Tom Thienes - \"Whimseys\" and others). He raised a child as a single father, having arrived in Hollywood \"with thirty dollars and a box of pampers\" - and actually earned his career accomplishments with hard work and dedication.
