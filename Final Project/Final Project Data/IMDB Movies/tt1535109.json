It is - through director Paul Greengrass's distinctive lens - simultaneously a pulse-pounding thriller, and a complex portrait of the myriad effects of globalization. The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips (two time Academy Award®-winner Tom Hanks), and the Somali pirate captain, Muse (Barkhad Abdi), who takes him hostage. Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control.","simplePlot":"The true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the U.S.-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.","actors":[{"actorName":"Tom Hanks","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwNDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2NDY3NQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 July 1956","placeOfBirth":" Concord, California, USA","birthName":"Thomas Jeffrey Hanks","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His father had English, and some German, ancestry, while his mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a lot after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no abuse, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He had no acting experience in college and, in fact, credits the fact that he couldn't get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. He met his second wife, actress Rita Wilson on the set of his television show Bosom Buddies (1980) - she appeared in one episode in the second season (1981), Bosom Buddies: All You Need Is Love (1981). They have two children, and Tom has another son and daughter by his first wife, Samantha Lewes. In 1996, he made his first step behind the camera, directing and writing as well as starring in the film, That Thing You Do! (1996).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwNDA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2NDY3NQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158","name":"Tom Hanks","idIMDB":"nm0000158"},"actorId":"nm0000158","character":"Captain Richard Phillips","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0153350","main":true},{"actorName":"Catherine Keener","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001416","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMzQ1Mzg1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE4MTU5MQ@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 March 1959","placeOfBirth":" Miami, Florida, USA","birthName":"Catherine Ann Keener","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"Catherine Keener is an American actress, Oscar-nominated for her roles in the independent films Being John Malkovich (1999) and Capote (2005). Acclaimed in her community for her quirky roles in independent film and mainstream such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005), Keener got her start as a casting director in New York City. Catherine Ann Keener was born in Miami, Florida, and was raised in Hialeah, FL. She is the daughter of Evelyn (Jamiel) and James Keener, who owned an auto shop. She is of Lebanese (mother) and English, Scottish, and German (father) descent. Keener attended Wheaton College in Massachusetts. She began taking acting classes when she was unable to sign up for a photography class. After graduating, Keener managed a McDonalds in New York City before becoming an assistant casting director and soon relocating to Los Angeles. Not long after, Keener told her superior of her aspirations for acting and she landed a one-worded role as a waitress in About Last Night... (1986). Two years later, she landed a role in a film called Survival Quest (1988), where she met her future husband, Dermot Mulroney. After struggling for years in the industry, Keener landed a role in an independent film, opposite the unknown Brad Pitt, in Johnny Suede (1991). Her ascent in independent film began as she starred in Living in Oblivion (1995) and Walking and Talking (1996) before her mainstream break with Being John Malkovich (1999) in 1999, which earned Keener her first Oscar nomination. Since then, Catherine Keener has starred in several critically acclaimed films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwMzQ1Mzg1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE4MTU5MQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001416","name":"Catherine Keener","idIMDB":"nm0001416"},"actorId":"nm0001416","character":"Andrea Phillips","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0407694","main":true},{"actorName":"Barkhad Abdi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5831542","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjU1OTgyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjgzNTU5MDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 April 1985","placeOfBirth":" Mogadishu, Somalia","birthName":"Barkhad Abdinasir Abdi","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Barkhad Abdi was born on April 10, 1985 in Mogadishu, Somalia as Barkhad Abdinasir Abdi.

He is a citizen of the United States, Canada, and Italy. His parents were involved in the arts and instilled in him an appreciation for all things creative. After moving around a bit as a child, he made his way back to New York City and began to study acting.

He then took a break from acting to focus on his early love of fine art, attending the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and receiving a BFA in painting and sculpture. After completing college, Martini began to work steadily in both film and television projects. His film roles were sharing the screen with Tom Hanks and Matt Damon in Saving Private Ryan (1998) as \"Cpl Fred Henderson\", Ryan's commanding officer who helped \"Captain Miller\" (Hanks) and his men in the brutal final shootout of the film; and also had roles in some smaller independent films, working with Calista Flockhart in Pictures of Baby Jane Doe (1995), Chris Penn and Jeffrey Wright in Cement (2000) and in the 2000 Sundance Film Festival favorite, Backroads (2000). He also took on a lead role in the Steven Spielberg Emmy-nominated 20 hour mini-series Taken (2002) and has a recurring role with Kiefer Sutherland as \"Agent Steve Goodrich\" on Fox's Emmy-nominated 2nd season of 24 (2001). Other television work includes series regular roles on John Sacret Young's Level 9 (2000), Chris Carter's Harsh Realm (1999) and recurring roles on Breaking News (2002), and the award-winning Canadian series, Da Vinci's Inquest (1998).
