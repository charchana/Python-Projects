At the University of Iowa, he was outstanding in swimming, basketball and football. When World War II broke out, he enlisted as a Marine fighter pilot and instructor. In Hollywood, he was a noted stunt man, doubling for Errol Flynn, John Wayne, and Gregory Peck. Gene Autry signed him for the lead in his 78-episode The Range Rider (1951) TV series. He tested to replace Johnny Weissmuller, as Tarzan but lost out to Lex Barker. In 1960, he played the heavy in Gordon Scott's Tarzan the Magnificent (1960), and his part there led Sy Weintraub to hire him as Scott's replacement. In his two Tarzan movies, he did all his own stunts. In Tarzan's Three Challenges (1963), he continued working in spite of dysentery, dengue fever and pneumonia. By this time, Weintraub was looking for a younger Tarzan, envisioning a future TV series. By mutual agreement, his contract with Mahoney was dissolved. After a couple of years regaining his strength and weight, Jock returned to making action films.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE2OTI5ODkyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAwOTU5Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0537146","name":"Jock Mahoney","nicknames":["Jocko"],"idIMDB":"nm0537146"},"actorId":"nm0537146","character":"Cmndr.

The handsome actor portrayed many authority figures, both in the movies and on television. He managed to display a wide emotional range, as evidenced by his tour-de-force performance as \"Lt. Fitzgerald\" in the 12 February 1960 episode of The Twilight Zone (1959), episode The Twilight Zone: The Purple Testament (1960). Reynolds also had a close relationship with Jack Webb. He had the lead role in Pete Kelly's Blues (1959), and had a memorable guest spot as \"Sgt. William Riddle\" on Dragnet 1967 (1967). His last role was on the Webb-produced series, Project U.F.O.

His parents emigrated to the US shortly after his birth. His early interest in acting led him to study at the acclaimed Pasadena Community Playhouse. He landed the lead villain role in the Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy film Babes in Toyland (1934), and rapidly became a familiar and reliable heavy in pictures both large and small. In 1936 he adopted the stage name Henry Brandon after several years of being billed as either Henry or Harry Kleinbach. He captivated thriller audiences as the sinister Dr. Fu Manchu in Drums of Fu Manchu (1943), yet balanced things by playing a sizable number of sympathetic roles as well, such as the skilled foreman Joe Dombrowski in Black Legion (1937). He continued to work on stage throughout his film career, playing the villain for many years in the record-length run of the melodrama \"The Drunkard\". His sharp features led him rather incongruously to be cast as Indian chiefs in two John Ford features, The Searchers (1956) and Two Rode Together (1961). He kept busy in films and occasional television roles, as well as reprising his role in \"The Drunkard\" onstage in the 1980s, until the end of his life. Brandon was a confirmed bachelor.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMTYzMzgyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgyODUxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0104770","name":"Henry Brandon","idIMDB":"nm0104770"},"actorId":"nm0104770","character":"Dr. Carl Hunter","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Douglas Kennedy","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448004","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWIzODMzNWMtYzlhZS00MTcwLTgzOGMtYjdiNTJmN2U4ZGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 September 1915","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Douglas Richards Kennedy","height":"6' 4\" (1.93 m)","bio":"A tall, powerfully built man, Douglas Kennedy entered films after graduating from Amherst. Making his debut in 1940, he appeared in many westerns and detective thrillers, often as a villain. World War II interrupted his career, and he spent the war years as a Signal Corps officer and an operative in the OSS and US Army Intelligence. After the war he returned to Hollywood, where he began playing supporting roles in larger films and an occasional lead in a lower-budget film. He is most fondly remembered, though, by audiences of the 1950s for two roles: his western TV series Steve Donovan, Western Marshal (1955), and as one of the policemen taken over by the Martians in the sci-fi classic Invaders from Mars (1953).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWIzODMzNWMtYzlhZS00MTcwLTgzOGMtYjdiNTJmN2U4ZGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0448004","name":"Douglas Kennedy","idIMDB":"nm0448004"},"actorId":"nm0448004","character":"Capt.
