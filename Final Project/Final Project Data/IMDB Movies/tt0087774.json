Ferrell originally had been tipped for stardom with her turn as the prostitute \"April\" in the Norman Lear-produced series Hot L Baltimore (1975), in which she recreated her role in Lanford Wilson's off-Broadway hit. However, what was a hit play in New York turned out to be a flop on national TV and, though she worked steadily ever since, it took her role in support of stars Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer in \"Men\" to get her the attention her talent richly deserved. For her role as \"Berta\", Conchata was nominated for an Emmy Award as Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in both 2005 and 2007. She has three Emmy nominations in total, having previously gotten a nod in 1992 for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for L.A. Law (1986). Conchata Galen Ferrell was born on March 28, 1943 in Charleston, West Virginia, to Mescal Loraine (George) and Luther Martin Ferrell. She attended West Virginia University and Marshall University. Conchata graduated from Marshall with a degree in social studies in education. Eventually, she sought a life in the theater, and achieved success off-Broadway as a member of the Circle in the Square theatrical company in Wilson's \"Hot L Baltimore\". For her next off-Broadway appearance, as \"Gertrude Blum\" in Edward J. Moore's \"The Sea Horse\", Ferrell won Drama Desk, Theatre World and Obie Awards as best actress in 1974. She has worked steadily in television and films ever since. Ferrell is married to Arnie Anderson, and has one daughter.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjUzMDk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU3OTU3._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004916","name":"Conchata Ferrell","idIMDB":"nm0004916"},"actorId":"nm0004916","character":"Mili Simonescu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Carrie Snodgress","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811202","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDMwNTgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM4MzcxOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"27 October 1945","placeOfBirth":" Park Ridge, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Caroline Louise Snodgress","height":"5' 5¾\" (1.67 m)","bio":"A student of Northern Illinois University, Carrie switched to drama at Chicago's Goodman Theatre School where she won the Sarah Siddons Award as outstanding graduate. After graduating, Carrie worked in Television and also appeared in Television movies. She made her big screen debut in Rabbit, Run (1970), working with James Caan. Her next movie was Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970) for which her role as Tina Balser gave her an Academy Award nomination. With similar Golden Globe nominations, Carrie was on the brink of stardom when she left it all to live with rock musician Neil Young, the father of her son, Zeke. It would be almost 8 years before she returned to the screen as a supporting actor in Brian De Palma's The Fury (1978). After a few more films, Carrie debuted on Broadway in the 1981 play \"A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking.\" She continued making movies in the 1980s, some of which were good; others that were not. In the '90s, most of Carrie's supporting actor roles are being filmed for Television. One of the big screen films that she made was the critically acclaimed Blue Sky (1994), which was released years after being made and gave Jessica Lange an Oscar. Carrie has also turned up on series Television in The X-Files (1993) and Murder, She Wrote (1984).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDMwNTgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM4MzcxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0811202","name":"Carrie Snodgress","idIMDB":"nm0811202"},"actorId":"nm0811202","character":"Stefania Comaneci","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Carl Strano","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833424","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Carl Strano is an actor, known for Dreamscape (1984), Terror Tract (2000) and Infinity (1996).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0833424","name":"Carl Strano","idIMDB":"nm0833424"},"actorId":"nm0833424","character":"Nicholae Vieru","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Karrie Ullman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1115477","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Karrie Ullman is an actress, known for Nadia (1984) and Happily Ever After (1985).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1115477","name":"Karrie Ullman","idIMDB":"nm1115477"},"actorId":"nm1115477","character":"Young Teodora Ungureanu","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Leslie Weiner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0918249","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Leslie Weiner is an actress, known for Nadia (1984) and The Children's Story (1982).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0918249","name":"Leslie Weiner","idIMDB":"nm0918249"},"actorId":"nm0918249","character":"Younger Nadia Comaneci","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0068343","main":true},{"actorName":"Simon Adams","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0011360","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Simon Adams is an actor, known for The Bounty (1984), The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe (1979) and Prick Up Your Ears (1987).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0011360","name":"Simon Adams","idIMDB":"nm0011360"},"actorId":"nm0011360","character":"Kurt Stilier","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Bozidar Alic","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0019562","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 December 1954","placeOfBirth":" Zagreb, Croatia, Yugoslavia [now Croatia]","bio":"Bozidar Alic was born on December 24, 1954 in Zagreb, Croatia, Yugoslavia.
