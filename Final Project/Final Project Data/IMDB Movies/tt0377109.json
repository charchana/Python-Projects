Her maternal grandfather was Welsh. Her father died when Naomi was seven and she began to follow her mother and her brother around England, until she was fourteen, when they settled in Australia, where her maternal grandmother was from. She coaxed her mother into letting her take acting class when they arrived. After bit parts in commercials, she landed her first role in For Love Alone (1986). Naomi met her best friend, Nicole Kidman, when they both auditioned for a bikini commercial and they shared a taxi ride home. In 1991, Naomi starred along Kidman in the sleeper-hit Flirting (1991) directed by John Duigan. Naomi continued her career by starring in the Australian Brides of Christ (1991) co-starring Oscar-winners Russell Crowe and Brenda Fricker. In 1993, she worked with John Duigan again in Wide Sargasso Sea (1993) and director George Miller in Gross Misconduct (1993). Tank Girl (1995), in 1995, an adaptation of the comic book was a cult hit, starred Naomi as \"Jet Girl\", but it didn't fare well at the box-office and didn't do much for her career as a whole. Watts continued to take insignificant parts in movies including the much forgotten film Children of the Corn: The Gathering (1996). It wasn't until David Lynch cast her in the critically acclaimed film Mulholland Drive (2001) that she began to become noticed. Her part as an aspiring actress showed her strong acting ability and wide range and earned her much respect, as much as to say by some that she was overlooked for a Oscar nomination that year. Stardom finally came to Naomi in the surprise hit The Ring (2002), which grossed over $100,000,000 at the box-office and starred Watts as a investigative reporter hunting down the truth behind several mysterious deaths seemingly caused by a video tape. While the movie did not fare well with the critics, it launched her into the spotlight. In 2003, she starred in Alejandro González Iñárritu's 21 Grams (2003) which earned her - what some say is a much overdue Oscar nomination and brought others to call her one of the best in her generation of actors. The same year, she was nominated for 21 Grams (2003), Naomi was chosen to play \"Ann Darrow\" in director Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) which took her to New Zealand for a five month shoot. Watts completed her first comedy in I Heart Huckabees (2004) for director David O. Russell, playing a superficial spokes model - a break from her usual intense and dramatic roles she is known for. In 2005, she reprized her role as the protective-mother-reporter \"Rachel Keller\" in The Ring Two (2005). The movie, released in March, opened to $35,000,000 at the box office in the first weekend and established her as a box-office draw. Also in 2005, it was decided that her independent movie Ellie Parker (2001) would be re-released in late 2005 after its success at resurfacing at the Sundance Film Festival. The movie, which Naomi also produced, features her in the title role and is a bit biographical, but yet exaggerated take of the life of a struggling actress as she comes to Hollywood and encounters nightmares of the profession (it also features Watts' own beat-up Honda which she travels around in). In 2006, she starred with Edward Norton in Le voile des illusions (2006). In July of 2007, Naomi gave birth to a boy, Alexander Pete (Sasha Schreiber) in Los Angeles with Liev Schreiber. Since then her career choices have gathered even more critical acclaim with starring roles roles in German director Michael Haneke's American remake of his thriller Funny Games (2007), David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises (2007), and the action-thriller, The International (2009), released in February 2009. In mid-2008, Watts announced she was expecting her second child with Schreiber and gave birth to another boy, Samuel Kai Schreiber, in New York on December 13.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY1NTA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk3MDYwOQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915208","name":"Naomi Watts","nicknames":["Queen of Remakes"],"idIMDB":"nm0915208"},"actorId":"nm0915208","character":"Rachel","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003584","main":true},{"actorName":"Simon Baker","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0048932","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MzQzOTAzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5OTEzMDE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 July 1969","placeOfBirth":" Launceston, Tasmania, Australia","birthName":"Simon Baker-Denny","height":"5' 9\" (1.75 m)","bio":"Simon Baker was first recognized in 1992, when he received Australia's prestigious Logie award for Most Popular New Talent.

Her mother, Jo Williams, was a concert pianist and drug treatment counselor, and her father, James Perkins, was a businessman, farmer, and writer. She is of Greek and English descent. Perkins studied acting at Chicago's Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University for three years, then launched her professional career with a co-starring gig in the touring company of Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs (1986). Seasoned, she returned to New York in the spring of 1984 to make her Broadway debut as a replacement in the Simon play. As a stage actress, she has trod the boards with Playwrights Horizon, the Ensemble Studio, The New York Shakespeare Festival, and, back in Chcago, with the Steppenwolf Theater. She found time out to marry the Chicago actor Terry Kinney. Her first major film role was in the underwhelming screen adaptation of David Mamet's \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\" which was turned into a Rob Lowe/Demi Moore star vehicle retitled About Last Night... (1986). Perkins sparkled as the grown woman interested in Tom Hanks in Big (1988), but her career was spotty and she never gained the traction to bring her the stardom that seemed to be within her grasp. In 1991, Perkins starred with Kevin Bacon in He Said, She Said (1991) (thus giving her a Bacon Factor of exactly 1) but, sadly, for such a talented actress, her biggest box-office hit has proven to be The Flintstones (1994), in which she portrayed Wilma. Perkins made her television debut in For Their Own Good (1993), a 1993 TV movie based on the true story of a woman who underwent mandatory sterilization to work in a chemical plant. She starred in the NBC comedy series Battery Park (2000) produced by Gary David Goldberg (who recently directed her in Must Love Dogs (2005) in a supporting role to her good friend Diane Lane), and HBO's If These Walls Could Talk 2 (2000). Her other TV work includes Babilônia 2000 (1999), Rescuers: Stories of Courage: Two Women (1997), and From the Earth to the Moon (1998) in an episode directed by Sally Field. Perkins divorced Kinney and now is married to the cinematographer Julio Macat. Recently, she starred in John Patrick Shanley's black comedy \"Four Dogs and a Bone\" at Los Angeles' Geffen Playhouse. She also has a starring role in the series Weeds (2005) for Showtime. Her talent, personality, and good looks keep her steadily employed, and it wouldn't be surprising if now, on the other side of 40, she makes a breakthrough and does some major work commensurate with her early promise.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MjQ3MDY5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI2MjgzNA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001610","name":"Elizabeth Perkins","idIMDB":"nm0001610"},"actorId":"nm0001610","character":"Dr. Emma Temple","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003586","main":true},{"actorName":"Gary Cole","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0170550","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwODU5MTU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk2NzMzMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"20 September 1956","placeOfBirth":" Park Ridge, Illinois, USA","birthName":"Gary Michael Cole","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Gary Cole was born on September 20, 1956 in Park Ridge, Illinois, USA as Gary Michael Cole.

She was born Mary Elizabeth Spacek on December 25, 1949, in Quitman, Texas, to Virginia Frances (Spilman) and Edwin Arnold Spacek, Sr., a county agricultural agent. Her father's family was of Czech and German origin. Sissy attended Quitman High School and was homecoming queen. After graduating, she embarked on an acting career, gaining interest in the profession through her cousin, actor Rip Torn. Sissy relocated to New York, and through him, enrolled in the New York branch of the Actors Studio. She studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Institute while also pursuing work as a model and singer, appearing in West Village showcases such as the Bitter End for $10 a night. Sissy eventually broke into film and one of her first roles was as Holly in the classic Badlands (1973). The art director on that film was Jack Fisk, with whom she would marry in 1974 and ultimately collaborate on eight films. Sissy followed this landmark film with a star-making and Oscar nominated performance in Carrie (1976), in which she played a humiliated prom queen who goes postal with her telekinesis. Sissy has had an enduring and award winning career in movies and television, which includes an Oscar as Best Actress for Coal Miner's Daughter (1980). The parents of two grown daughters, Sissy and Jack live on a large horse ranch in the foothills of Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. Even though she continued to appear in film and television during the late 1980s and 1990s, Sissy devoted most of those years to her family. Then, in 2001, Sissy returned to the big screen in a major way with a powerful performance in In the Bedroom (2001), which not only earned her a sixth Best Actress Oscar nomination, but a win for Best Actress at the Golden Globes, Independent Spirit Awards, and numerous critics association awards. Sissy continues to work steadily as an actress, but in 2012, her credits expanded even further to include a memoir, My Extraordinary Ordinary Life, as well as planning her directorial debut on the in-development film Sweet Tea.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAwMTU4NTMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyMTg4MTE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651","name":"Sissy Spacek","idIMDB":"nm0000651"},"actorId":"nm0000651","character":"Evelyn","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003593","main":true},{"actorName":"Ryan Merriman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0581365","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MWI5NzktNTNlYi00MWFmLWI5ZmUtNDE1MWVjMGMzMTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 April 1983","placeOfBirth":" Choctaw, Oklahoma, USA","birthName":"Ryan Earl Merriman","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Ryan Earl Merriman was born in Choctaw, Oklahoma, to Nonalyn and Earl Merriman.

Back in 1999, she had the opportunity to join up as lead singer with a small band and take the stage as an opening act for Reba McEntire and, later on, sang \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" for the \"School's Out! Christmas\" album released by Universal Records Hip-O Records, which also features the voices of other child stars, including Mae Whitman, Evan Rachel Wood, 'Jesse Mccartney' and others. She was handpicked by director Steven Spielberg to sing \"God Bless America\" in his film A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001); and in the Oliver Beene (2003) episode entitled \"Oliver and the Otters\", Daveigh was given the opportunity to showcase her talent by singing the hit 60s song \"Tossin' and Turnin'\". She has since recorded four original songs. Outside of the entertainment industry, some of Daveigh's favorite activities are surfing, horseback riding, dancing, reading, and just hanging out with family & friends.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMDAyMjA4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg1ODkzMg@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0153738","name":"Daveigh Chase","idIMDB":"nm0153738"},"actorId":"nm0153738","character":"Samara","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0003598","main":true},{"actorName":"Kelly Stables","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1261587","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUyNjY5MDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMzNDYzODE@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"26 January 1978","placeOfBirth":" St. Louis, Missouri, USA","birthName":"Kelly Michelle Stables","height":"4' 11\" (1.5 m)","bio":"Kelly Stables was born on January 26, 1978 in St. Louis, Missouri, USA as Kelly Michelle Stables.
