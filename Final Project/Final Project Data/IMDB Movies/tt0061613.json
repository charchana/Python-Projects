She trained as a dancer for seven years and supported herself as a model. In 1946, at age 16, she won the Miss Rome beauty pageant and through this, she obtained role in a Maria Della Costa film. One year later, she was one of the girls in the Miss Italia contest. Lucia Bose became \"The Queen\", and nearby, on the stage of Stresa, were some other future stars of Italian cinema: Gina Lollobrigida, Eleonora Rossi Drago and Gianna Maria Canale. Mangano's earlier connection with filmmaking occurred with her romantic relationship with actor Marcello Mastroianni. This led her to a film contract, though this would take some time for Mangano to ascend to international stardom with her role in Bitter Rice (1949). Thereatfer, she signed a contract with Lux Film, and later married Dino De Laurentiis, who was on the verge of becoming a known producer. Though she never scaled the heights of her contemporaries Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, Mangano remained a favorite star of the 1950s and 1970s, appearing in Anna (1951), The Gold of Naples (1954), Mambo (1954), Teorema (1968), Death in Venice (1971) and L'argent de la vieille (1972). Married to film producer Dino De Laurentiis from 1949, the couple had four children: Veronica, Raffaella, Francesca and Federico. Veronica's daughter Giada is the host of \"Everyday Italian\" and \"Giada at Home\" on the Food Network. Raffaella co-produced with her father on Mangano's penultimate film, the science fiction epic Dune (1984). In 1983, she separated from De Laurentiis and abandoned her career to live in Paris and Madred, where she made tapestries. Following surgery on December 4, 1989 that left her in a coma, Silvana Mangano died at age 59 of lung cancer in Madred, Spain during the early morning hours of December 16, 1989.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNzQ4OTEzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI5NTIxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0542146","name":"Silvana Mangano","nicknames":["Miss Rome"],"idIMDB":"nm0542146"},"actorId":"nm0542146","character":"Giocasta","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0054306","main":true},{"actorName":"Franco Citti","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0162948","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMDg5MDA1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIyOTUzOA@@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"23 April 1935","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","bio":"Franco Citti was born on April 23, 1935 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.

Born in Pola, Italy (now Croatia), on May 3, 1921, the daughter of a Tridentine journalist and professor and an Istrian homemaker, she studied dramatics as a teen at the Motion Picture Academy of Rome and Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia before snaring bit roles in such films as Three Cornered Hat (1935) [\"The Three-Cornered Hat\"] and Les deux sergents (1936) [\"The Two Sergeants\"]. She made a name for herself in Italy during WWII playing the title role in Manon Lescaut (1940), won a Venice Film Festival award for Le mariage de minuit (1941) [\"Little Old World\"] and was a critical sensation in We the Living (1942) [\"We the Living\"]. She briefly abandoned her career, however, in 1943, refusing to appear in what she considered fascist propaganda, and was forced into hiding. The next year she married surrealist painter/pianist/composer Oscar De Mejo. They had two children, and one of them, Carlo De Mejo, became an actor. She divorced in 1955, then she came back to Italy, Following her potent, award-winning work in the title role of Eugenie Grandet (1946), she was discovered and contracted by David O. Selznick to play the murder suspect Maddalena Paradine in Alfred Hitchcock's The Paradine Case (1947). She was billed during her Hollywood years simply as \"Valli,\" and Selznick also gave her top femme female billing in Carol Reed's classic film noir The Third Man (1949), but for every successful film--such as the ones previously mentioned--she experienced such failures as The Miracle of the Bells (1948), and audiences stayed away. In 1951 she bid farewell to Hollywood and returned to her beloved Italy. In Europe again, she was sought after by the best directors. Her countess in Luchino Visconti's Senso (1954) was widely heralded, and she moved easily from ingénue to vivid character roles. Later standout films encompassed costume dramas as well as shockers and had her playing everything from baronesses to grandmothers in such films as Eyes Without a Face (1960) [\"Eyes Without a Face\"], Le gigolo (1960), Oedipus Rex (1967) [\"Oedipus Rex\"], Tender Dracula, or Confessions of a Blood Drinker (1974), 1900 (1976), Suspiria (1977), Luna (1979), Inferno (1980), Aspern (1982), A Month by the Lake (1995) and, her most recent, Angel of Death (2002).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTMyODUzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTczOTkxOA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0885098","name":"Alida Valli","idIMDB":"nm0885098"},"actorId":"nm0885098","character":"Merope","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Carmelo Bene","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0070644","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 September 1937","placeOfBirth":" Campi Salentina, Puglia, Italy","birthName":"Carmelo Pompilio Realino Antonio Bene","bio":"Carmelo Bene was born on September 1, 1937 in Campi Salentina, Puglia, Italy as Carmelo Pompilio Realino Antonio Bene.

He could have easily given inspiration to the creepy look Richard O'Brien gave his bizarre character in \"The Rocky Horror Show.\" Born in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan in New York City, Julian was the son of Irving, a businessman, and Mabel Lucille (Blum) Beck. Educated at the College of the City of New York, he briefly attended Yale University, but then abandoned it to pursue writing and art. An abstract expressionist painter in the 1940s, his life's destiny was forever changed after meeting his future wife, actress/writer/director Judith Malina, in 1943. His passions swiftly centered around the likes of hers -- the theatre -- and together they co-founded The Living Theatre in 1947, which would base itself in New York City. Their subsequent contributions propelled the off-off-Broadway movement and the vision of performance art. Julian would continue to work with the Living Theater up until his death nearly forty years later. The group strongly reflected the ideals of another theatre revolutionary, Antonin Artaud (1896-1948), who embraced the Theatre of Cruelty and sought to jar its audiences out of their own complacency. The plays were presented in various venues, chiefly in the couple's own home when it couldn't financial keep up a theatre space. The Living Theatre also spread its philosophy throughout the world, performing extensively in non-traditional places such as street corners and prisons. In one performance piece, from Jack Gelbert's \"The Connection,\" the drama about drug addiction had its actors playing junkies and wandering about the audience shouting expletives while demanding money for a fix. They were among the first to import the plays of Bertolt Brecht and Jean Cocteau, as well as modernist poets such as T.S. Eliot and Gertrude Stein. Their productions could be undeniably repelling or imaginative and often involved collective improvisation. It took on an anarcho-pacifist point of view while celebrating the uninhibited use of drugs, hallucinogens, crude language and anything else under the kitchen sink in order to send home its political intent or shock effect. One of their their most controversial works was \"Paradise Now\" (1968), a free-form denouncement of American life that involved nudity and audience participation. Other productions include \"The Brig\" (1963), \"In the Jungle of the Cities\" (1960), The Brig (1963), \"Frankenstein\" (1968) and Antigone (1968). Their work often led to their frequent arrests for anything from indecent exposure to drug possession. The Living Theater moved out of New York for a time in 1974 due to tax problems and a sensationalistic trial that Beck and Malina lost. Besides his theatre work, Beck published several volumes of poetry reflecting his left-wing, anarchist beliefs, two non-fiction books and a handful of experimental and mainstream films. His intense, imposing acting style was captured vividly in films, such as his sadistic gangster in The Cotton Club (1984) and his creepy, spectral stranger in Poltergeist II: The Other Side (1986), a rare major role that ended up becoming his final movie. Diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1983, he died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City while filming the afore-mentioned movie at the age of 60 on September 14, 1985. He was survived by his wife, a brother, and two children, Garrick and Isha.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE0NTU0ODU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzgwMDU2NA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0065191","name":"Julian Beck","idIMDB":"nm0065191"},"actorId":"nm0065191","character":"Tiresia","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004825","main":true},{"actorName":"Luciano Bartoli","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0059010","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 October 1946","placeOfBirth":" Rome, Lazio, Italy","bio":"Luciano Bartoli was born on October 17, 1946 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.
