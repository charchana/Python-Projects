Tristan Bernard, the famous French playwright and producer took notice of this feat. He engaged Dauphin for the leading role of his next play \"La fortune\" was was also made into a film the next year. Dauphin's next break came when Charles Boyer left for American movies. As Boyer left for America, Dauphin succeeded in the Henri Bernstein organization, outstanding stage producers of Paris. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Dauphin starred in several plays as well as sixty five French made pictures. Dauphin received his elementary education at Ecole Fenelon and high school at Lycee Condorcet. he also graduated from Lycee Louis de Grand in literature and philosophy, all of these school located in Paris. Between 1940 and 1945, he was a solider in the French and allied armies. he was a lieutenant in the French tank service and shuttered later in life at his memories of that kind of grisly warfare. After the fall of France, he organized his own stock company and toured non-occupied cities and small towns. he was also serving in the French underground movement. Threatened with exposure, he escaped by buying a small fishing boat in the south of France and sailing to Gibraltar. After reaching London in 1942, he first served with the British Secret Service and then joined the Free French forces of DeGaulle. Claude quickly learned English, of which he was devoid of, and became a liaison officer between the French LeClerc division and the press corps of the American Army of General Patton. Because of this association, he was one of the first to enter Paris on Liberation Day. Dauphin's American film debut was in the movie \"Deported\" produced largely in Italy. He later appeared in many stage productions on Broadway including \"No Exit\" and \"Happy Time\". He later had a screen test with Warner Bros. and then returned to France. Having almost forgotten about the test, he was summoned to Hollywood for \"April in Paris\" starring Doris Day and Ray Bolger.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Njg1NjY2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcxNjczNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0202405","name":"Claude Dauphin","idIMDB":"nm0202405"},"actorId":"nm0202405","character":"André Chabrolles","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean Dax","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0206312","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWE0YjZmMGUtN2JhNi00NmIyLWFjYTMtNzJlODdlYjE1NWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"17 September 1879","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Gontran Théodore Louis Henri Willar","bio":"Jean Dax was born on September 17, 1879 in Paris, France as Gontran Théodore Louis Henri Willar.
