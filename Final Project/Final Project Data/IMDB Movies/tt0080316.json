Nakadai was subsequently cast in the lead role in Kobayashi's monumental trilogy 'Ningen no joken' and became a star whose international acclaim rivaled that of countryman Toshirô Mifune. Like Mifune, Nakadai worked frequently with director Akira Kurosawa and indeed more or less replaced Mifune as Kurosawa's principal leading man after the well-known falling out between Mifune and Kurosawa. His appearances for Kurosawa in Kagemusha, l'ombre du guerrier (1980) and Ran (1985) are among the most indelible in the director's oeuvre.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MzYwNDA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDExMTMwNw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619938","name":"Tatsuya Nakadai","nicknames":["Moya","The Snake"],"idIMDB":"nm0619938"},"actorId":"nm0619938","character":"General Nogi","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0082767","main":true},{"actorName":"Teruhiko Aoi","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0996374","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 January 1948","placeOfBirth":" Tokyo, Japan","bio":"Teruhiko Aoi was born on January 10, 1948 in Tokyo, Japan.

He was born in Tsingtao, China, to Japanese parents and grew up in Dalian. He did not set foot in Japan until he was 21. His father was an importer and a commercial photographer, and young Toshiro worked in his father's studio for a time after graduating from Dalian Middle School. He was automatically drafted into the Japanese army when he turned 20, and enlisted in the Air Force where he was attached to the Aerial Photography Unit for the duration of the World War II. In 1947 he took a test for Kajirô Yamamoto, who recommended him to director Senkichi Taniguchi, thus leading to Mifune's first film role in These Foolish Times II (1947). Mifune then met and bonded with director Akira Kurosawa, and the two joined to become the most prominent actor-director pairing in all Japanese cinema. Beginning with Drunken Angel (1948), Mifune appeared in 16 of Kurosawa's films, most of which have become world-renowned classics. In Kurosawa's pictures, especially Rashomon (1950), Mifune would become the most famous Japanese actor in the world. A dynamic and ferocious actor, he excelled in action roles, but also had the depth to plumb intricate and subtle dramatic parts. A personal rift during the filming of Red Beard (1965) ended the Mifune-Kurosawa collaboration, but Mifune continued to perform leading roles in major films both in Japan and in foreign countries. He was twice named Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (for Yojimbo (1961) and Red Beard (1965)). In 1963 he formed his own production company, directing one film and producing several others. In his later years he gained new fame in the title role of the American TV miniseries Shogun (1980), and appeared infrequently in cameo roles after that. His last years were plagued with Alzheimer's Syndrome and he died of organ failure in 1997, a few months before the death of the director with whose name he will forever be linked, Akira Kurosawa.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NzE2MzEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5MTU4Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001536","name":"Toshirô Mifune","nicknames":["The Wolf","The Shogun"],"idIMDB":"nm0001536"},"actorId":"nm0001536","character":"Emperor Meiji","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004759","main":true},{"actorName":"Hisaya Morishige","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0605662","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 May 1913","placeOfBirth":" Hirakata, Osaka, Japan","height":"5' 7¼\" (1.71 m)","bio":"Hisaya Morishige was born on May 4, 1913 in Hirakata, Osaka, Japan.

The following year, Toho promoted him to stardom in Kihachi Okamoto's surprise smash hit, the cynical war picture Dokuritsu Gurentai (Desperado Outpost, 1959). Thereafter he split his time between toplining Toho's war pictures and gangster pictures (but not always as the villain now). Typical of his gangster films are Ishiro Honda's Shinko no ko (1960) and Jun Fukuda's Ankokugai no Kiba (Fangs of the Underworld, 1962).

Upon graduating from Tokyo University (Japan's most prestigious), Hirata confounded many family expectations of him by pursuing a career in acting. His first roles, in EVEN THE MIGHTY SHED TEARS and EMBRACE (1953), brought him to the attention of director Ishiro Honda, who promptly cast Hirata first in his WW2 romance FAREWELL RABAUL (1954) and then, later that year, in the role that would come to define Hirata's career: the tormented, one-eyed scientist Daisuke Serizawa, who alone has figured out a way to destroy the monster GOJIRA. That movie made stars out of all of the younger actors who were fortunate enough to star in it, though Hirata tended more towards second leads and character parts. He was often called the best-known of all actors to appear in Gojira movies (he would turn up in six of the sequels), but this was due as much to his popularity with directors as with his exposure through the monster movies. He was a favorite of directors Ishiro Honda, Jun Fukuda, Hiroshi Inagaki, and much beloved by virtually all the actors who knew him: honest and humorous, highly intellectual but never pretentious. He appeared in literally every kind of movie Toho Studios made, from the monster pictures to samurai dramas (including his one movie for Kurosawa, SANJURO) to war dramas to comedies. Still, he remained identified most directly in the public's mind with the original GOJIRA; his character Serizawa is among the best remembered and most admired in all Japanese films, both inside Japan and out. Hirata was chosen by Toho to announce the monster's return in GOJIRA (1984), and was tapped for a major role; but he died tragically of lung cancer before he could begin shooting.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0386284","name":"Akihiko Hirata","idIMDB":"nm0386284"},"actorId":"nm0386284","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Yôko Nogiwa","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634004","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"24 January 1936","placeOfBirth":" Toyama, Japan","height":"5' 4¼\" (1.63 m)","bio":"Yôko Nogiwa was born on January 24, 1936 in Toyama, Japan.
