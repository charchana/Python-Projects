However, the versatile actor has been steadily working on both stage and screen since his television debut in the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001). After being cast in the World War II drama, Hardy left his studies at the prestigious Drama Centre in London and was subsequently cast as Twombly in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) and as the villain Shinzon in Star Trek: Nemesis (2002). Tom was born on September 15, 1977 in Hammersmith, London; his mother, Elizabeth Anne (Barrett), is an artist and painter, and his father, Edward Hardy, is a writer. He is of English and Irish descent. Hardy was brought up in East Sheen, London, and first studied at Reed's School. His education continued at Tower House School, then at Richmond Drama School, and subsequently at the Drama Centre London, along with fellow Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. After winning a modeling competition at age 21, he had a brief contract with the agency Models One. Tom spent his teens and early twenties battling delinquency, alcoholism and drug addiction; after completing his work on Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), he sought treatment and has also admitted that his battles with addiction ended his 5-year marriage to Rachael Speed. Returning to work in 2003, Hardy was awarded the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for his theatre performances in the productions of \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Blood\". In 2003, Tom also co-starred in the play \"The Modernists\" with Paul Popplewell, Jesse Spencer and Orlando Wells. During the next five years, Hardy worked consistently in film, television and theatre, playing roles as varied as Robert Dudley in the BBC's The Virgin Queen (2005), Bill Sikes in Oliver Twist (2007) and starring in \"The Man of Mode\" at the National Theatre. On the silver screen, he appeared in the crime thriller Layer Cake (2004) with Daniel Craig, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006), and the romp Scenes of a Sexual Nature (2006). In 2006, Hardy created \"Shotgun\", an underground theatre company along with director Robert Delamere, and directed a play, penned by his father for the company, called \"Blue on Blue\". In 2007, Hardy received a best actor BAFTA nomination for his touching performance as Stuart Shorter in the BBC adaptation of Alexander Masters' bestselling biography Stuart: A Life Backwards (2007). Hardy, hailed for his transformative character acting, was lauded for his emotionally and physically convincing portrayal in the ill-fated and warmhearted tale of Shorter, a homeless and occasionally violent man suffering from addiction and muscular dystrophy. The following year, he appeared as gay hoodlum Handsome Bob in the Guy Ritchie film RocknRolla (2008), but this would be his next transformation that would prove his extensive range and stun critics. In the film Bronson (2008), Hardy played the notorious Charles Bronson (given name, Michael Peterson), the \"most violent prisoner in Britain\". Bald, pumped-up, and outfitted with Bronson's signature strongman mustache, Hardy is unrecognizable and gives a harrowing performance that is physically fearless and psychologically unsettling. Director Nicolas Winding Refn breaks the fourth wall with Hardy retelling his tales directly to viewers as well as performing them outright before an audience of his own imagining. The performance mixes terrifying brutality, vaudevillian showmanship, wry humor, and an alarming amount of commitment, and won Hardy a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor. The performance got Hollywood's attention, and in 2009, Hardy was named one of Variety's \"10 Actors to Watch\". That year, he continued to garner praise for his starring role in The Take (2009), a four-part adaptation of Martina Cole's bestselling crime novel, as well as for his performance as Heathcliff in a version of Wuthering Heights (2009). Recent work includes the aforementioned breakthrough appearance in Inception (2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page. The movie was released in July 2010 and became one of top 25 highest grossing films of all time, collecting eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning four. Other films include Warrior (2011), opposite Joel Edgerton, the story of two estranged brothers facing the fight of a lifetime from director Gavin O'Connor, and This Means War (2012), directed by McG and co-starring Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. Tom also starred in the heralded Cold War thriller, La taupe (2011) with Colin Firth and Gary Oldman. Hardy rejoined Christopher Nolan for The Dark Knight Rises (2012); he played the villain role of Bane opposite Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gary Oldman. Hardy's menacing physique and his character's scrambled, hard-to-distinguish voice became a major discussion point as the film was released. Outside of performing, Hardy is the patron for the charity \"Flack\", which is an organization to aid the recovery of the homeless in Cambridge. And in 2010, Hardy was named an Ambassador for The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged youth. On the recent stage, he starred in the Brett C. Leonard play \"The Long Red Road\" in early 2010. Written for Hardy and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the play was staged at Chicago's Goodman Theater. In 2015, Hardy starred as the iconic Mad Max in George Miller's reboot of his franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). He also collected a British Independent Film Award for his portrayal of both the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie, in Legend (2015), and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as John Fitzgerald in The Revenant (2015). He has an outlaw biker story among other projects in development. In 2010, Hardy became engaged to fellow English actress Charlotte Riley, whom he starred with in The Take (2009) and Wuthering Heights (2009), and is raising a young son, Louis, with ex-girlfriend Rachael Speed.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODEyNjA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE4ODMyMjE@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0362766","name":"Tom Hardy","idIMDB":"nm0362766"},"actorId":"nm0362766","character":"Ivan Locke","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0381328","main":true},{"actorName":"Olivia Colman","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1469236","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MDMxOTgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAwMDQ0NA@@._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"30 January 1974","placeOfBirth":" Norwich, Norfolk, England, UK","birthName":"Sarah Caroline Olivia Colman","height":"5' 7\" (1.7 m)","bio":"Olivia Colman was born on January 30, 1974 in Norwich, Norfolk, England as Sarah Caroline Olivia Colman.

His father, Jim, worked in the Fas government employment agency, and his mother, Nora, taught art at a secondary school. Andrew attended Gonzaga, a Jesuit school for boys on the south side of Dublin. From the age of 8 he took drama classes for children on Saturdays at the Anne Kavanagh school, and then in his early twenties he helped tutor younger students. He made two commercials for Irish television, for Flahavan's Porridge and Disney/Fanta. At 17 Andrew starred in his first professional role in the 1994 Irish drama \"Korea.\" Later that year, he matriculated into Trinity College in Dublin to begin a degree in drama, but left after six months. He went on to perform at the Abbey Theatre, the national theater of Ireland, in four plays. In early 2000 Scott moved to London for a supporting role in \"Longitude,\" a multi-part television movie starring Michael Gambon. Scott played many roles on the stage and received two Olivier awards. In 2006, Scott made his Broadway debut in David Hare's \"The Vertical Hour\" starring with Bill Nighy and Julianne Moore. He was nominated for a Drama League award for his role. Occasional film and television work in Britain, Ireland and America interspersed his stage career. Most notable of these was \"Band of Brothers,\" \"John Adams,\" and the television comedy series, \"My Life in Film.\" \"Sherlock,\" a modern-day revamp of the classic stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for BBC Television proved to be a turning point in Scott's career in 2010 when he gained notice as Moriarty, the fictional detective's nemesis. Scott starred in the play, \"Birdland\" by Simon Stephens, in the spring of 2014, where he played the role of a jaded rock star contemplating the meaning of fame. His film work stepped up considerably with roles in several important movies including 20th Century Fox's James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe starrer, \"Frankenstein\" released in 2015.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjI2NTc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM5NjY4Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0778831","name":"Andrew Scott","idIMDB":"nm0778831"},"actorId":"nm0778831","character":"Donal","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0502308","main":true},{"actorName":"Ben Daniels","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199842","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NjU4NDE2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcxODExOTE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"10 June 1964","placeOfBirth":" Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, UK","height":"6' (1.83 m)","bio":"Ben Daniels is a multi-award winning performer who is equally at home whether working in Film, Television or Theatre. He was born in the Midlands and became interested in acting through drama lessons while at comprehensive school. He began his career after leaving London's prestigious LAMDA drama school. His early work in theatres around the UK led to him being cast as Richard Loeb, one of the two Chicago \"thrill killers\" who murdered a nine-year-old boy in John Logan's factual play, \"Never the Sinner\", at London's Playhouse Theatre. His performance earned him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor in that year's Laurence Olivier Awards and has led to a highly respected theatre career, notably \"Martin Yesterday\" by Canadian writer Brad Fraser for which he received a M.E.N. nomination for Best Actor, \"As You Like It\" (TMA Supporting Actor award nomination), \"All My Sons\" receiving an Olivier Award and a Whatsonstage Award for Supporting Actor and, most recently, starring opposite Academy Award nominee Laura Linney in the Broadway revival of Christopher Hampton's \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\", for which he received a Tony Nomination for Best Actor, A Theatre World Award for Breakthrough Broadway Performance, a Drama Desk nomination for Distinguished Performance and an Outer Critics Circle nomination for Outstanding Performance. Ben's television breakthrough came playing philandering \"Finn Bevan\" in three seasons of the BAFTA-nominated BBC series Cutting It (2002).

His paternal grandparents were from the Isle of Man and Ireland, respectively. He lives with his parents and three younger brothers - Paddy and twins Sam and Harry. Tom attended Donhead Prep School. Then, after a successful eleven plus exam, he became a pupil at Wimbledon College. Having successfully completed his GCSEs, in September 2012 Tom started a two-year course in the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology notable for its numerous famous alumni. Holland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, London. His potential was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page (who was an Associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot and Billy Elliot the Musical) when he performed with his dance school as part of the Richmond Dance Festival 2006. After eight auditions and subsequent two years of training, on 28 June 2008 Tom made his West End debut in Billy Elliot the Musical as Michael, Billy's best friend. He gave his first performance in the title role of Billy on 8 September 2008 getting rave reviews praising his versatile acting and dancing skills. In September 2008 Tom (together with co-star Tanner Pflueger) appeared on the news programme on channel FIVE and gave his first TV interview. In 2009 Tom was featured on ITV1 show \"The Feel Good Factor\". At the launch show on 31 January he and two other Billy Elliots, Tanner Pflueger and Layton Williams, performed a specially choreographered version of Angry Dance from Billy Elliot the Musical, after which Tom was interviewed by host Myleene Klass. Then he became involved into training five ordinary British schoolboys learning to get fit and preparing their dance routine (fronted by Tom) for the final \"The Feel Good Factor\" show on 28 March 2009. On 11 March 2010 Tom Holland along with fellow Billy Elliots Dean-Charles Chapman and Fox Jackson-Keen appeared on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on ITV1. On 8 March 2010, to mark the fifth anniversary of Billy Elliot the Musical, four current Billy Elliots, including Tom Holland, were invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It was Tom Holland who was chosen to be a lead at the special fifth anniversary show on 31 March 2010. Elton John, Billy Elliot the Musical composer, who was at the audience, called Tom's performance \"astonishing\" and said that he was \"blown away\" by it. Holland had been appearing on a regular basis as Billy in Billy Elliot the Musical rotating with three other performers till 29 May 2010 when he finished his run in the musical. In two months after leaving Billy Elliot the Musical, Holland successfully auditioned for a starring role in the film The Impossible[18] (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona) alongside Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. The Impossible was based on a true story that took place during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012, and was released in Europe in October 2012, and in North America in December 2012. Tom has received universal praise for his performance, in particular: \"What a debut, too, from Tom Holland as the eldest of their three lads\" (The Telegraph); \"Tom Holland, making one of the finest feature debuts in years\" (HeyUGuys); \"the excellent Tom Holland\" (The Guardian); \"The child performers are uncanny and there is an especially terrific performance from Tom Holland as the resourceful, levelheaded Lucas terrified but tenacious in the face of an unspeakable ordeal\" (Screen Daily); \"Young Holland in particular is astonishingly good as the terrified but courageous Lucas.\" (The Hollywood Reporter); \"However, the real acting standout in The Impossible is the performance of Tom Holland as the eldest son Lucas. His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland's film\" (Entertainment Maven); \"Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor\" (New York Times). Tom has given a number of interviews about his role in The Impossible. In particular, he talked on video to Vanity Fair Senior West Coast editor Krista Smith and with IAMROGUE's Managing Editor Jami Philbrick. He has also given interviews to The Hollywood Reporter,[32] to the MovieWeb, to Today Show on NBC and to other outlets. Tom's director and co-stars have also talked about him. Juan Antonio Bayona: \"He had this extraordinary ability to get into the emotion and portray it in a very, very easy way. The best I'd ever seen in a kid.\" Ewan McGregor: \"It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He's really talented and polite to everyone. It's very easy for children to lose perspective but he's absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor.\" Naomi Watts: \"He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He's just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he's inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone's game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.\" In his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: \"One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner's speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro'd his \"Impossible\" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts' great performances his dad had only let him see \"King Kong\" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn't know it was \"difficult\" because he actually \"loved it\"... Most important, this was Holland's first film role and he sweetly noted, \"From the moment I met you, you took my hand and you never let go.\" Cue the \"awwww\" from the audience.\" The presentation is available on video. In 2011, Holland was cast in British version of the animation film Arrietty, produced by Japan's cult Studio Ghibli. He has provided voice over for the principal character Sho. In 2012 Tom Holland played the starring role of Isaac in the film \"How I lived Now\"[44] (directed by Kevin Macdonald) alongside Saoirse Ronan. The film is due to be released in 2013. [edit]Awards, nominations and affiliations On 17 October 2012, Holland became a recipient of Hollywood Spotlight Award for his role in The Impossible. \"We are very excited that we will be able to recognize acting talents that are on the road to discovery and stardom,\" said Carlos de Abreu, founder and executive director of the Hollywood Film Awards in a statement. On 6 December 2012 it was announced that Holland became a winner of the National Board of Review award in the \"Breakthrough Actor\" category. In the end of December 2012, Holland was voted a winner for the year's Best Youth Performance in Nevada Critics Awards. In December 2012, Holland received a number of nominations (pending) for his role in The Impossible: for the 18th annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards, in the \"Best Young Acror/Acress\" category; for Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Most Promising Performer\" category; for the 27th Goya Awards in the \"Best New Actor\" category; for the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the \"Best Youth Performance\" category; for the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2012 in the \"Young British Performer of the Year\" category. Kristopher Tapley, Editor-at-Large of HitFix, reported on 27 August 2012 that Summit Entertainment, the company responsible for distribution of The Impossible in USA, would be campaigning Holland rather than McGregor as the lead, and strongly argued that Tom Holland deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actor category. The fact of long-listing for an Academy Award was confirmed in the article in the Hollywood Reporter: \"And though McGregor stars as his father in the film, Holland has been submitted as the lead actor for awards consideration. Regardless if he receives any nominations, his performance as the strong-willed and determined eldest son is garnering critical acclaim.\" As one of the most promising young actors, Holland was featured in Screen International's \"UK Stars of Tomorrow - 2012\" and in Variety's \"Youth Impact Report 2012\". Holland has been signed up by William Morris Endeavor (WME) global talent agency and is represented by Curtis Brown literary and talent agency. In 2015, Tom was cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Sony and Marvel's upcoming films. He will play the role starting with Captain America: Civil War (2016) and the Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NzY1NzUzNzJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDczMDcyMzgx._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4043618","name":"Tom Holland","idIMDB":"nm4043618"},"actorId":"nm4043618","character":"Eddie","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0440247","main":true},{"actorName":"Bill Milner","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2389463","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MzgwMDQ0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUxMDQyNzE@._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"4 March 1995","placeOfBirth":" Surrey, England, UK","birthName":"William Henry Milner","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"Bill Milner was born on March 4, 1995 in Surrey, England as William Henry Milner.
