Leung has been in the film industry for more than 30 years, starring in a variety of roles. His debut film was Burning of the Imperial Palace (1983), where he played the Xianfeng Emperor. He would later work with Yun-Fat Chow in three films, Prison on Fire (1987), A Better Tomorrow III: Love and Death in Saigon (1989), and The Return of the God of Gamblers (1994). In 1991, Leung went to France to appear in Jean-Jacques Annaud's The Lover (1992), based on Marguerite Duras's novel, as the older lover of a young teen schoolgirl, who was played by British actress Jane March. Leung's ongoing career has seen him star in films such as The Myth (2005), Double Vision (2002), Everlasting Regret (2005) and Election (2005).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTM3OTk5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMxODA1OA@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504899","name":"Tony Ka Fai Leung","idIMDB":"nm0504899"},"actorId":"nm0504899","character":"The Hawk","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Kenny Lin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5341380","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNDYyNjA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAwNjY4MzE@._V1_UY44_CR17,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 February 1988","placeOfBirth":" Shenyang, Liaoning, China","birthName":"Gengxin Lin","height":"6' 1¼\" (1.86 m)","bio":"Kenny Lin was born on February 13, 1988 in Shenyang, Liaoning, China as Gengxin Lin.
