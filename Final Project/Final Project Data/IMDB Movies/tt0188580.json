He became People's Artist of the RSFSR in 1964. Sergey Alexandrovich Martinson was born in Saint Petersburg in the family of a nobleman of Swedish descent. His parents adored theater and took their son to many performances. As a schoolboy, Sergey played in a theatrical studio. After one year of education in the Technological institute, he decided to become a professional actor. At the entrance exams he read Boris Godunov's monologue from Pushkin's play. The exam board roared with laughter, but refused to accept him. He later joined the theatrical institute from a second attempt. Martinson worked in several theaters. In 1924-1941 he played in the Theatre of the Revolution. In 1925-1926, 1929-1933, 1937-1938 he was the leading actor of Vsevolod Meyerhold's theatre. He was cast by Meyerhold in the plays The Government Inspector, Mandate and others. From 1933 to 1936 he worked in the music hall. From 1945 until his death Martinson was a film actor. He was mainly a comic actor and seldom appeared in dramatic roles. One of these was the role of Karandyshev in Alexander Ostrovsky's play Without a Dowry, staged by Yury Zavadsky. Martinson's career in film started in 1924, when he played his first role of Poincare in the film of the Adventures of Oktyabrina. Martinson was the first in the Soviet cinema to play Hitler in the Sergei Yutkevich film The New Adventures of Soldier Svejk. Actor told, that Hitler, after seeing himself on the screen, included him into his personal \"black list\" and promised to hang Martinson on the first lamppost. After the role of composer Kerosinov in the movie Anton Ivanovich is angry glory literally followed on Martinsons heels - the boys in the courtyard hooted after him: \"Benzin-kerosene goes!\". One of his latest roles was the role of Mr. Frankland in the adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's novel The Hound of the Baskervilles. He married his first wife, Ekaterina Il'inichna Ilyina, a beautiful actress, in 1927, whom he met during his acting studies; their daughter, Anna, later a successful artist and costume designer, was born in 1928. Although they had never officially divorced, he married his second wife, dancer Lola Dobrohotova, who was later exiled by the government for alleged \"connections to foreign elements\" and died in exile; they had a son, Alexander Martinson (1939-2001) who reconciled with his Sergey during the last years of his life and did all he could to take care of his father that he loved dearly . His third wife, Luisa, was a woman 30 years junior to Martinson. They had a daughter, Natasha Martinson (b. June 16th, 1956), who followed in the footsteps of Martinson by pursuing an acting career early on in her life and even starring alongside Martinson in the film \"Adventures of captain Vrungel\", she featured in a variety of films in Russia. Luisa and Martinson divorced several years after the birth of their daughter but maintained a lifelong friendship and Luisa took care of Sergey especially during the last years of his life when he needed help the most. As of 2012, both his daughters, his last wife Luisa and grandchildren live in the United States.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0554178","name":"Sergei Martinson","idIMDB":"nm0554178"},"actorId":"nm0554178","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Galina Novozhilova","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0637276","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"bio":"Galina Novozhilova is an actress, known for Slyozy kapali (1983), Pushkinskiye skazki (1973) and Dyuymovochka (1964).","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0637276","name":"Galina Novozhilova","idIMDB":"nm0637276"},"actorId":"nm0637276","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Elena Ponsova","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690557","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"14 May 1907","placeOfBirth":" Malakhovka, Moscow uyezd, Moscow Governorate, Russian Empire [now Lyuberetsky District, Moscow Oblast, Russia]","birthName":"Elena Dmitrievna Ponsova","bio":"Elena Ponsova was born on May 14, 1907 in Malakhovka, Moscow uyezd, Moscow Governorate, Russian Empire as Elena Dmitrievna Ponsova.

He was born Mikhail Mikhailovich Yanshin on November 2, 1902, in Yukhnov, Smolensk province, Russian Empire (now Kaluga province, Russia). His father, Mikhail Yanshin, was a banking clerk. From 1909-1916 Yanshin studied at private Olkhovsky School in Moscow. From 1916-1919 he studied at Moscow Technical school, then entered the College of Technology, then joined the Red Army. He served in the Security Forces of the Red Army until 1922. That same year he was admitted to 2nd Studio of the Moscow Art Theatre where his teacher was Michael Chekhov. In 1924 he was promoted to leading roles by Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. Yanshin shot to fame in Moscow in 1926, with his successful performances as Lariosik in 'Dni Turbinykh' (The days of the Turbins) by Mikhail A. Bulgakov. The play ran more than two hundred performances and was attended by Joseph Stalin for at least fifteen times. In November of 1926 Yanshin married actress Veronika Polonskaya, who was just eighteen; writer Mikhail A. Bulgakov was his best man at the wedding. Polonskaya and Yanshin were friends of Vladimir Mayakovsky, who became involved in affair with Polonskaya. All three were together the night before Vladimir Mayakovsky killed himself by the gunshot. From 1937-1941 Mikhail Yanshin was Artistic Director of Moscow Gipsy Theatre \"Romen\"; at that time he was married to the leading actress Lyalya Chyornaya (Nadezhda Kiseleva). Yanshin updated the repertoire by adding classic plays of Alexander Pushkin and Maxim Gorky to the traditional Gipsy show. In 1939 he also directed two plays by 'Federico Garcia Lorca', who was revered in Russia after his tragic execution in Franco's Spain. From 1941 to the end of his life Yanshin was again with the Moscow Art Theatre. From 1950-1963 Yanshin was Artistic Director of the Stanislavsky Drama Theatre. There he met beautiful actress Nonna Meyer; they married in 1955 and remained together until his death. Yanshin was responsible for bringing new life to the struggling Stanislavsky Drama Theatre. He stimulated mature actors and encouraged young talents, such as Evgeniy Leonov, Evgeniy Vesnik, Evgeniy Urbanskiy, Boris Levinson, Pyotr Glebov, Liliya Gritsenko, Yelizaveta Nikishchikhina, Vladimir Anisko and other notable Russian actors. After the death of Joseph Stalin, when the cultural \"Thaw\" was initiated by Nikita Khrushchev, Yanshin again staged 'Dni Turbinykh' (The days of the Turbins) by Mikhail A. Bulgakov. This time the legendary role of Lariosik was brilliantly played by Evgeniy Leonov. In 1963 Yanshin was attacked by the Soviet Ministry of Culture. His effort to stage new contemporary plays was criticized by hard-line officials. Yanshin quit the Stanislavsky Drama Theatre and moved back to the troupe of Moscow Art Theatre, which was struggling after the death of both founders, Konstantin Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko. At that time, Yanshin was instrumental in bringing director Oleg Efremov to lead the struggling MKhAT to renewal and re-gaining popularity among the younger audiences. Yanshin together with Alla Tarasova were the strongest supporters of artistic innovations brought by Oleg Efremov to the Moscow Art Theatre. Mikhail Yanshin was designated People's Artist of the USSR (1955), and was awarded State Prize of the USSR (1975). He was twice decorated with the Order of Lenin, and received other awards and decorations. He enjoyed a lasting film career spanning over 45 years, from silent films to Soviet comedies of the 60s and 70s. Yanshin died of a heart failure on July 17, 1976, in Moscow, and was laid to rest in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, Russia.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946263","name":"Mikhail Yanshin","idIMDB":"nm0946263"},"actorId":"nm0946263","character":"","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true}],"seasons":[],"idIMDB":"tt0188580","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188580","business":{"budget":null,"openingWeekend":null,"gross":null,"weekendGross":null,"admissions":null,"productionDates":null,"filmingDates":null,"copyrightHolder":null},"technical":{"runtime":["30 min"],"soundMix":null,"color":["Color"],"aspectRatio":null,"camera":null,"laboratory":null,"filmLength":null,"negativeFormat":null,"cinematographicProcess":null,"printedFilmFormat":null},"rating":"7.4","filmingLocations":[],"awards":[],"votes":"384","type":"Movie","companyCreditsSimple":[{"idCompany":"co0114162","name":"Soyuzmultfilm"}],"keywords":{"keywords":["fairy tale","one word title"]}}]},"about":{"version":"2.30.0","serverTime":"2017/04/15 10:49:36"}}
