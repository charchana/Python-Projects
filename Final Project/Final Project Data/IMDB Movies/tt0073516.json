Her father was a gendarme, her mother was a sales-woman. Young Miou-Miou was selling strawberries helping out at her mother's fruit and vegetable stand at a street market. There she was spotted by actor-director Romain Bouteille, who invited her to work at Cafe de la Gare, a popular Parisian theatre, where Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere were principal actors. There she began as a cleaning lady, then became a dresser, then an actress. She was nicknamed Miou-Miou by Coluche because she was always nice, quiet, and clean as a kitty. In 1971, Miou-Miou made her film debut in La vie sentimentale de Georges le tueur (1971) (The Sentimental Life of George Le Tueur 1971). At that time she became romantically involved with the fellow actor Patrick Dewaere. Their daughter, named Angele, was born in 1974, but their relationship ended few years later, after their work in several films. Their relationship was portrayed in F comme Fairbanks (1976), and later was documented in _Patrick Dewaere (1992 documentary)_. Miou-Miou has been an unusual personality in the French cinema. She once refused to take the Cesar Award for Best Actress, which she won for the title role in Memoirs of a French Whore (1979). She explained that refusal citing her belief that artists should not compete against each other. Her career was hardly affected by such a gesture. She was nominated for Cesar nine times. Her better known works were made with Gérard Depardieu in Going Places (1974), This Sweet Sickness (1977), Ménage (1986), and Germinal (1993), an adaptation of the eponymous novel by Émile Zola.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MTQwNjQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk4ODgwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0591877","name":"Miou-Miou","idIMDB":"nm0591877"},"actorId":"nm0591877","character":"Anita Boucher","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Jean Lefebvre","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498876","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxMjA4NzI3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NTM1NTE@._V1_UY44_CR15,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"3 October 1919","placeOfBirth":" Valenciennes, Nord, France","birthName":"Jean Marcel Lefebvre","bio":"Jean Lefebvre was born on October 3, 1919 in Valenciennes, Nord, France as Jean Marcel Lefebvre.

Over the years she equipped herself well opposite the established talents of Raymond Rouleau, Jules Berry, Raimu, Pierre Brasseur and Paul Meurisse. Born Raymonde-Renee Vittore, the daughter of a hotel owner and opera singer, she married wealthily at age 21 before entering the acting leagues. After studies at a drama school in Marseilles, she made her film bow in The Two Orphans (1933), based on the Gish sisters' silent classic \"Orphans in the Storm\" (she took Lillian's role), and for which she adopted the moniker Saint-Cyr, supposedly taken from a beloved canine. Saint-Cyr's alluring beauty, patrician demeanor, and skill at both comedy and drama helped continue her momentum in such films as The Last Millionaire (1934), directed by Rene Clair, Paris (1936), the German musical fantasy Donogoo (1936) and Pearls of the Crown (1937). She also graced the stage during this time in a production of \"The Threepenny Opera\" among others. She nixed an offer to sign with 20th Century-Fox, but continued filming internationally with England's Strange Boarders (1938), and Italy's Red Roses (1940) with Vittorio de Sica. Following popular roles in The Fantastic Symphony (1942), Marie-Martine (1943), Pamela (1945), The Glorious Avenger (1953), and If Paris Were Told to Us (1955), she left films but returned in the early 60s. By this time her son Georges Lautner had become a prominant film writer and director and was beginning to churn out a series of standard genre movies often with Renee in the cast, including The Monocle (1964) and The Bottom Line (1976), My Other Husband (1983) and Room Service (1993), her last.","urlPhoto":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/nopicture/medium/name-2135195744._CB522736367_.png","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0756679","name":"Renée Saint-Cyr","idIMDB":"nm0756679"},"actorId":"nm0756679","character":"Docteur Laville","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com","main":true},{"actorName":"Maria Pacôme","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0655582","urlPhoto":"","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"18 July 1923","placeOfBirth":" Paris, France","birthName":"Simonne Pacôme","height":"5' 5¼\" (1.66 m)","bio":"Maria Pacôme was born on July 18, 1923 in Paris, France as Simonne Pacôme.
