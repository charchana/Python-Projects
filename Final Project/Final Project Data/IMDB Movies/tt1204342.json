She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry. Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as \"Brigadoon\" and \"A Chorus Line\". It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work. Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Belles à mourir (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Cruel Intentions (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"Kathryn Merteuil\". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Cruel Intentions 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, Dr. Vegas (2004). Her role in the low-budget independent film Junebug (2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of \"Giselle\" in the animated/live-action feature film, Enchanted (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Adams next appeared in the major production, Charlie Wilson's War (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Sunshine Cleaning (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as \"Sister James\" in Doubt (2008) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as Amelia Earhart in Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in Julie & Julia (2009). In the early 2010s, she starred with Jason Segel in The Muppets (2011), with Philip Seymour Hoffman in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012), and alongside Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in Trouble with the Curve (2012). She played reporter Lois Lane in Man of Steel (2013) and con artist Sydney Prosser in American Hustle (2013), before portraying real-life artist Margaret Keane in Tim Burton's biopic Big Eyes (2014). In 2016, she reprised her role as Lane in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and headlined Denis Villeneuve's science fiction drama Arrival (2016) and Tom Ford's dark thriller Nocturnal Animals (2016).","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NjExMjI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc0MjY2OQ@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010736","name":"Amy Adams","idIMDB":"nm0010736"},"actorId":"nm0010736","character":"Mary","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0235488","main":true},{"actorName":"Chris Cooper","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177933","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5NTgxMzgxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyMjcxNA@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"9 July 1951","placeOfBirth":" Kansas City, Missouri, USA","height":"5' 10\" (1.78 m)","bio":"Christopher Walton Cooper was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Mary Ann (Walton), a homemaker, and Charles Sherwood Cooper, a cattleman and internist who served as a doctor in the US Air Force.

He was born Alan Wolf Arkin on March 26, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York. His family were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Germany. In 1946 the Arkins moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, California. His father, David I. Arkin, was an artist and writer, who worked as a teacher, and lost his job for merely refusing to answer questions about his political affiliation during the 1950s Red Scare. His father challenged the politically biased dismissal and eventually prevailed, but unfortunately it was after his death. His mother, Beatrice (Wortis) Arkin, a teacher, shared his fathers views. Young Arkin was fond of music and acting, he was taking various acting classes from the age of 10. He attended Franklin High School, in Los Angeles, then Los Angeles City College from 1951 - 1953, and Bennington College in Vermont from 1953 - 1954. He sang in a college folk-band, and was involved in a drama class. He dropped out of college to form the folk music group The Tarriers, in which Arkin was the lead singer and played guitar. He co-wrote the 1956 hit \"The Banana Boat Song\" - a Jamaican calypso folk song, which became better known as Harry Belafonte's popular version, and reached #4 on the Billboard chart. At that time Arkin was a struggling young actor who played bit parts on television and on stage, and made a living as a delivery boy, repairman, pot washer and baby sitter. From 1958 - 1968 he performed and recorded with the children's folk group, The Babysitters. He has also recorded an entire album for the Elektra label titled \"Folksongs - Once Over Lightly.\" In 1957 Arkin made his first big screen appearance as a lead singer with The Tarriers in Calypso Heat Wave (1957). Then he made his Off-Broadway debut as a singer in \"Heloise\" (1958). Next year he joined the Compass Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri. There he caught the eye of stage director Bob Sills and became the original member of the \"Second City\" troupe in Chicago. In 1961 Arkin made his Broadway debut in musical \"From the Second City\", for which he wrote lyrics and sketches, then starred as David Kolowitz in the Broadway comedy \"Enter Laughing\" (1963), for which he won a Tony Award. He starred in a Broadway musical \"From the Second City production, then returned to Broadway as Harry Berlin in \"Luv\" (1964). Arkin made his directorial debut with an Off-Broadway hit called \"Eh?\" (1966), which introduced the young actor, named Dustin Hoffman. He won a Drama Desk Award for his direction of the Off-Broadway production of \"Little Murders\" (1969), and another Drama Desk Award for \"The White House Murder Case\" (1970). He also directed the original version of Neil Simon's hilarious smash, \"The Sunshine Boys\" (1972), which ran over 500 performances. Arkin earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his feature acting debut in a comedy The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966), by director Norman Jewison, co-starring as Lt. Rozanov, a Soviet submariner who is mistaken for a spy after his boat accidentally wrecks aground in New England. Arkin demonstrated his dramatic range as the psychopathic killer Roat in suspense film Wait Until Dark (1967), opposite Audrey Hepburn. He reinvented himself as the sensitive deaf-mute in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968), for which he received his second Academy Award nomination as Best Actor in the Leading role. He followed with what remained his best known role as Captain Yossarian in Catch-22 (1970), directed by Mike Nichols and based on the eponymous anti-war novel by Joseph Heller. In it Arkin arguably gave his strongest performance, however, his career suffered because the film initially did not live up to expectations. After a few years of directorial work on television, Arkin made a comeback with an impressive portrayal of doctor Sigmund Freud in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976). In the early 1980s he acted in three movies that were family affairs, written by his wife, Barbara Dana, and co-starring his son, Adam Arkin. During the 1990s he turned out several notable performances, such as a bitter former baseball player in TNT's Cooperstown (1993), and as a hilarious psychiatrist opposite John Cusack in Grosse Pointe Blank (1997). He won raves for his portrayal of a divorced father who struggles to keep his kids enrolled in the Beverly Hills school system in Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). Arkin gave a brilliant performance opposite Robin Williams in Jakob le menteur (1999), a film about the Nazi occupation of Poland. He also returned to the New York stage co-starring with his son, Tony Arkin and Elaine May in \"Power Plays\", which he also co-authored. His most recent comeback as a heroin-snorting, sex-crazed, foul-mouthed grandfather in Little Miss Sunshine (2006), earned him his third Academy Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, and his first Academy Award. Alan Arkin has been a modern Renaissance man. In addition to his achievements as an actor, director, and producer, he made his mark as a singer-songwriter with his popular-song compositions \"Banana Boat Song\", \"Cuddle Bug,\" \"That's Me,\" and \"Best Time of the Year.\" Arkin also authored several books, including science-fiction and some children's stories, such as \"The Clearing\", \"The Lemming Condition\" and \"Cassie Loves Beethoven\" among his other publications. He is a father of three sons, Adam, Matthew, and Tony, and a grandfather of Molly Arkin. Alan Arkin has been a strong supporter of an organic way of living and also a proponent for preservation of the environment and natural habitat. He has been avoiding the show-biz-milieu and is known as an actor who does not really care about prestigious awards, but values having a good job and being acknowledged by his peers. In Arkin's own words he wants to \"Stay home for three months. Living as quietly as humanly possible.\" Arkin was given an Indian name, Grey Wolf, by his Native American friends in New Mexico.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NDk5Njc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc5NDc0._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000273","name":"Alan Arkin","nicknames":["The Tarriers"],"idIMDB":"nm0000273"},"actorId":"nm0000273","character":"Tour Guide","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0426769","main":true},{"actorName":"Bill Cobbs","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167850","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzMzODc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjIxNTc2._V1_UY44_CR1,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"16 June 1934","placeOfBirth":" Cleveland, Ohio, USA","height":"6' 1\" (1.85 m)","bio":"Bill Cobbs was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, where his parents were hard-working people, who instilled in him a sense of self-reliance and humility.

Cobbs was an Air Force radar technician for eight years; he also worked in office products at IBM and sold cars in Cleveland. In 1970, at the age of 36, he left for New York to seek work as an actor. There he turned down a job in the NBC sales department in order to have time for auditions. He supported himself by driving a cab, repairing office equipment, selling toys, and performing odd jobs.

His father is of Greek descent and his mother is of mostly English and Scottish ancestry. Zach moved to New York City after failing his last college class by one point. Zach got his start performing his brand of humor in the back of a hamburger joint in Times Square. He toured the country, performing in coffee shops and universities. After more than a decade performing stand-up and making both television and film appearances, Zach broke through to wider recognition with his co-starring role as \"Alan Garner\", in the comedy mega-hit, The Hangover (2009). Later that year, he played a large role in the CGI-heavy kids movie, G-Force (2009), and then appeared in memorable supporting parts in the films, Up in the Air (2009) (as a laid-off employee), Youth in Revolt (2009) (as a loutish stepfather), and Dinner for Schmucks (2010), as one of the title characters. More recently, he co-starred with Keir Gilchrist in the teen dramedy, It's Kind of a Funny Story (2010), with Robert Downey Jr. in the road trip comedy, Due Date (2010), and alongside Will Ferrell in the political spoof, The Campaign (2012). He also voiced \"Humpty Dumpty\" in the animated film, Puss in Boots (2011), and reprised his character in both The Hangover Part II (2011) and The Hangover Part III (2013). In 2014, he appeared in the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014), and in 2016, he starred in the comedies Masterminds (2016) and Keeping Up with the Joneses (2016), released three weeks apart. When not performing and acting, Zach spends time at his home in the mountains of his native North Carolina, where he hopes to open a writer's retreat on a completely self-sustained farm.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzI3NjIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA1OTIwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302108","name":"Zach Galifianakis","idIMDB":"nm0302108"},"actorId":"nm0302108","character":"Hobo Joe","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0265148","main":true},{"actorName":"Ken Jeong","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0421822","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTczNzU4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODUxMjMy._V1_UX32_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 July 1969","placeOfBirth":" Detroit, Michigan, USA","birthName":"Kendrick Kang-Joh Jeong","height":"5' 5\" (1.65 m)","bio":"Ken Jeong is a Korean-American actor, comedian, and physician.
