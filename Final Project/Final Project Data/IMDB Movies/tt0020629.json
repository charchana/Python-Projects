The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.","simplePlot":"A young soldier faces profound disillusionment in the soul-destroying horror of World War I.","actors":[{"actorName":"Louis Wolheim","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0938464","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzEwMzQwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE3NDQ3MTE@._V1_UY44_CR13,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"28 March 1880","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","height":"5' 10½\" (1.79 m)","bio":"It was Lionel Barrymore who gave Louis Wolheim (Cornell '07) his start as an actor.

A college dropout, he was found by a talent scout in the Coconut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles and entered Hollywood as a bit player. He was leading man to Greta Garbo in The Kiss (1929), but it was the role of Paul Baumer in All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) that was his big break. He was profoundly affected by the anti-war message of that film, and when, in 1942, the popular star of Young Dr. Kildare (1938) and subsequent Dr. Kildare films was drafted, he was a conscientious objector. America was outraged, and theaters vowed never to show his films again, but quietly he achieved the Medical Corps status he had requested, serving as a medic under fire in the South Pacific and as a chaplain's aid in New Guinea and the Phillipines. His return to film after the war was undistinguished until Johnny Belinda (1948) - his role as the sympathetic physician treating the deaf-mute Jane Wyman won him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. Subsequent movie roles were scarce; an opportunity to play Dr. Kildare in television was aborted when the network refused to honor his request for no cigarette sponsorship. He continued to act, but in the 1970s put his long experience into a project to bring to the west the philosophy of the East - the resulting film, Altars of the World (1976), while not a box-office success, won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award. Lew Ayres died in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1996, just two days after his 88th birthday.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODM3MjQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg0OTY5Nw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000817","name":"Lew Ayres","idIMDB":"nm0000817"},"actorId":"nm0000817","character":"Paul","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0507148","main":true},{"actorName":"John Wray","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942046","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzY3NTI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI3NDQ3MTE@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"13 February 1887","placeOfBirth":" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","birthName":"John Griffith Malloy","height":"5' 8\" (1.73 m)","bio":"John Wray was born on February 13, 1887 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA as John Griffith Malloy.

Following his father's death, the family moved to a farm in Portland, Maine where he later studied at Thornton Academy. He began his career singing in orchestras and made his Broadway debut in the musical \"Take the Air\" in 1927. He met Hearst paramour Marion Davies while singing in Venice, Italy and she cast him in a featured part in both the silent and talking versions of her movie Marianne (1929). Showing great promise, Universal signed him and he appeared opposite Laura La Plante in Hold Your Man (1929) and then scored a supporting soldier role in the classic anti-war drama All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) as well as the William Powell vehicle For the Defense (1930). A lull in film work occurred and he relocated to the East Coast appearing on Broadway for the next several years, including the plays \"Brief Moment,\" \"Personal Appearance\" and \"Baby Pompadour\". Universal later starred him in the serial cliffhanger Secret Agent X-9 (1937) and in The Wildcatter (1937), in which the studio changed his name to Scott Colton, which he kept. Dropped by the studio, he was later picked up by Columbia, who cast him in very minor \"B\" film fare such as Murder in Greenwich Village (1937), All-American Sweetheart (1937), Little Miss Roughneck (1938), Women in Prison (1938) and Extortion (1938). Following an unbilled appearance in I Am the Law (1938), Scott abandoned Hollywood. Back on Broadway and in stock shows (\"I Must Love Someone,\" \"Watch on the Rhine\"), Scott Colton happily retreated to Maine, where he stayed. He did appear as a radio announcer and at one point became a ranger. Married three times, Scott died at age 88 and was interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Wilton, Maine.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MTQxOTMwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU5ODY3Mw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0464131","name":"Scott Kolk","idIMDB":"nm0464131"},"actorId":"nm0464131","character":"Leer","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013826","main":true},{"actorName":"Owen Davis Jr.","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204113","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWIxMGYwOTctYThlNy00MjgwLTgxYWUtZTBiN2E2OTJlYWQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1_UY44_CR0,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"6 October 1907","placeOfBirth":" New York City, New York, USA","birthName":"Owen Gould Davis Jr.","bio":"Owen Davis Jr. was born on October 6, 1907 in New York City, New York, USA as Owen Gould Davis Jr. He was an actor and producer, known for All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), Knute Rockne All American (1940) and Bunker Bean (1936).

Which is the case of Richard (aka Dick) Alexander, one of those numerous character actors Hollywood used to over-consume without giving them the opportunity to really display their talents. Too bad because during the years 1926-1931, Alexander looked set to have an interesting career with supporting roles alongside Olga Baclanova (Lou's sweetheart in Josef von Sternberg's The Docks of New York (1928)), Bebe Daniels (Gonzales in Rio Rita (1929) and even the Divine Greta Garbo (The general's aide in The Mysterious Lady (1928). He also appeared in Lewis Milestone's antiwar masterpiece All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) as a German soldier. Unfortunately this was to be his swan song - with only a couple of exceptions such as Destination Unknown (1933) or The Scarlet Empress (1934)). As of 1931, Richard Alexander was to be hired either for minor (at times even very minor) parts in A Films (a warrior in The Crusades (1935), a farmer in The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936), a man with a pike in Marie Antoinette (1938)) or for supporting parts in hordes of mediocre westerns. Richard Alexander's tall figure, strong build and square-jawed face actually killed his career. The fault lies with the laziness of casting directors: Richard Alexander had given a good performance as a henchman in The Lone Star Ranger (1930), well, he would be a brutal henchman in every two run-of-the-mill westerns. Among the 300-odd roles he played, he was cast forty times as a henchman, no less! And if he was not the villain of the piece he was often credited as a strong, big, burly or tough guy. Sure he always made a good job of it but Richard Alexander had shown at the outset of his career how varied his acting could be and he would certainly rather not have repeated the same type of character over and over again. That is why playing Prince Barin, Buster Crabbe's loyal ally in the Flash Gordon (1936) serial must have been a breath of fresh air for him. Whatever the case may be, Richard Alexander continued bravely to be tough and burly on the screen, not retiring before the age of 72. Towards the end of his career, the aging performer also became an active member of the Screen Actors Guild, representing Hollywood extras. In 1989,Alexander passed away more or less forgotten in spite of his 307 screen appearances. He was 86.","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyZjE1NTUtYTk2Yy00NDg3LTljNWYtYWRjMTJmMzU3ZWY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1.jpg","urlIMDB":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0018685","name":"Richard Alexander","idIMDB":"nm0018685"},"actorId":"nm0018685","character":"Westhus","urlCharacter":"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0113756","main":true},{"actorName":"Harold Goodwin","urlProfile":"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0329467","urlPhoto":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY2NDQ5ZWMtZTg0Ny00NWIwLTg1ZWEtZTg2Njg5MDQ4ZmNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_UY44_CR2,0,32,44_AL_.jpg","biography":{"dateOfBirth":"1 December 1902","placeOfBirth":" Peoria, Illinois, USA","height":"6' 2\" (1.88 m)","bio":"Harold Goodwin was born on December 1, 1902 in Peoria, Illinois, USA.

Young Slim ran away from home as a youth and lived a rather wanderlust life until a chance meeting with Mack Sennett through his comedian friend Edgar Kennedy changed everything. He broke into silent films at age nineteen as one of Sennett's pie-hurling Keystone Kops and became part of the stock company of players. Making an unbilled appearance in Keystone's first feature film Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914), Summerville's gangly build and naive innocence, not to mention his potato-like nose, mournful mug, and slim, curling upper lip, helped set him apart -- so much so that Summerville eventually branched out into his own short vehicles. Much more comfortable in rumpled clothes and overalls than a suit and tie, he later learned the ropes of directing and in the 1920s helmed a string of short films for both Fox and Universal studios. He refocused on acting come the advent of sound and made a rather easy transition, standing out in a number of commercial films, both comedic and dramatic, including the mammoth war epic All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), the landmark musical film King of Jazz (1930), Hecht-MacArthur's classic The Front Page (1931), the Shirley Temple vehicles Captain January (1936) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938), and John Ford's Tobacco Road (1941). In addition he scored in a series of short comedies opposite Zasu Pitts, and a slew of supports in Hoot Gibson westerns. Usually playing much older than he was, the sleepy-eyed, slow-drawling Summerville played his last role in The Hoodlum Saint (1946), before dying of a stroke on January 5, 1946, at the not-so-old age of 53. He left a strong enough legacy, however, to be remembered as one of the screen's more reliable comedians.
