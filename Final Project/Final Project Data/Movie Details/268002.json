He receives an order to build a thermae in the colosseum to help gladiators recover from their wounds, but faces difficulties. Thus, Lucius travels again to modern day Japan through the time slip. He meets Manami (Aya Ueto) again, who is now a reporter for a magazine which covers bathroom. With the help of the flat face Japanese tribe, Lucius again designs a new thermae.  Meanwhile, Emperor Hadrian (Masachika Ichimura) wants to keep the peace with the thermae, but the Senate wants to extend the land by using force. Emperor Hadrian and the Senate now have a confrontation and Rome becomes divided.","popularity":0.09662,"poster_path":"/kjFWyoU50mV4WuEaC8PQtJHgKr5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2014-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thermae Romae II","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":5,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"Lucius","credit_id":"569eb562c3a36858ce0079c6","id":66155,"name":"Hiroshi Abe","order":1,"profile_path":"/a2vyZunjEClKkP6e8QWy9aS0M9d.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Manami Yamakoshi","credit_id":"569eb571c3a36858e5007e25","id":46363,"name":"Aya Ueto","order":2,"profile_path":"/pyswFekJUDk5Sd9VQ6d26HkMrst.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Keioniusu","credit_id":"569eb57fc3a36858c6007f87","id":2542,"name":"Kazuki Kitamura","order":3,"profile_path":"/2DefK5vG0JquPJ1UdcckaPRcy96.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Tateno","credit_id":"569eb58dc3a36858c30075b0","id":68987,"name":"Riki Takeuchi","order":4,"profile_path":"/pYUqbbucWli6uq8mFELO96s4eUg.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Antoninus","credit_id":"569eb5989251412ec7000090","id":1037690,"name":"Kai Shishido","order":5,"profile_path":"/rvJmtnBHMoJZIYKNHZEYvfRlBo7.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Shuzo Yamakoshi","credit_id":"569eb5b39251415a0700251d","id":80865,"name":"Takashi Sasano","order":6,"profile_path":"/ov2fPwygk0FBIXsD2K5vi9Eaf5J.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Hadrian","credit_id":"569eb5c4c3a36858cb006eb5","id":9717,"name":"Masachika Ichimura","order":7,"profile_path":"/PewyrEczJmfsef4FB8zln50Hre.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Yumi Yamakoshi","credit_id":"569eb5d7c3a36858c80073fb","id":127223,"name":"Midoriko Kimura","order":8,"profile_path":"/erPaxRNpHLVXHQFWYb1hdoTBv6J.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Marukusu","credit_id":"569eb5e9c3a36858c80073fe","id":1039354,"name":"Katsuya","order":9,"profile_path":"/49nBqidnduFTOrcFHkZhLh5fNWW.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Akeboniusu","credit_id":"569eb5f8c3a36858c6007f97","id":1565930,"name":"Akebono","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Kotooushunusu","credit_id":"569eb607c3a36858c8007405","id":1565931,"name":"Kotooshu","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Kaneko","credit_id":"569eb617c3a36858c30075ce","id":1247313,"name":"Tomoko Matsushima","order":12,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Ramen restaurant owner","credit_id":"569eb6319251415af10016b4","id":1565932,"name":"Minoru Shiraki","order":13,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"5364ff7cc3a3681241001276","department":"Directing","id":127440,"job":"Director","name":"Hideki Takeuchi","profile_path":"/5ECb2pYvq6P9tjYyIPXChlYtxH2.jpg"},{"credit_id":"5364ffa6c3a368124a0012ce","department":"Writing","id":1037689,"job":"Writer","name":"Mari Yamazaki","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5364ffedc3a368124100127d","department":"Writing","id":1107516,"job":"Writer","name":"Hiroshi Hashimoto","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Thermae Romae 2"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Terumae romae II"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Thermae Romae II"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"zh","iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"普通话","english_name":"Mandarin"},{"iso_639_1":"ja","iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"日本語","english_name":"Japanese"},{"iso_639_1":"el","iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"ελληνικά","english_name":"Greek"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1405,"name":"roman empire"},{"id":4379,"name":"time travel"},{"id":204351,"name":"hot spring"}]}}
