Then Edwarda (Bernadette Lafont), who is active in the political underground, comes into his life. From that point on, he begins to act on his beliefs. Edwarda's underground political action group stages a little drama to test Balthazar's commitment and reliability, putting him through an interrogation by what appear to him to be French secret police. Having passed this test, he is given a real assignment. This film is a comedy with elements of satire, and it explores the humor to be found in left-wing pretentiousness of all kinds. - Rovi","popularity":0.004226,"poster_path":"/v4s1q1wsFqBhtcnEnvVOeHbUMfJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valparaiso, Valparaiso","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Balthazar Lamarck-Caulaincourt","credit_id":"54a85ffec3a3680c30002737","id":5964,"name":"Alain Cuny","order":1,"profile_path":"/p7fQXfufcazjnA8jVqwWBYal8dO.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Edwarda","credit_id":"54a86011c3a3680c29002689","id":28254,"name":"Bernadette Lafont","order":2,"profile_path":"/5kaw6XGK8u6pWvrAq54I4KMQJqe.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Lazlo","credit_id":"54a860229251414d5b0025da","id":38899,"name":"László Szabó","order":3,"profile_path":"/dFEmQzfyfU557kH8PGHR3GI29EE.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Lara","credit_id":"54a86036c3a3680c2100287a","id":1138003,"name":"Albane Navizet","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"La paysanne","credit_id":"54a86046c3a3680c2100287c","id":18765,"name":"Alexandra Stewart","order":5,"profile_path":"/2hiKef95taRinlseKp6uFhVDTIR.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Un méchant","credit_id":"54a860619251414d6a002482","id":2407,"name":"Rufus","order":6,"profile_path":"/bbMPwEFZaALc3VqBPZ8od2rmRuv.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Un très méchant","credit_id":"54a86075c3a3680c29002699","id":32162,"name":"Clément Harari","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Helmut","credit_id":"54a860859251414d6700249c","id":22796,"name":"Hans Meyer","order":8,"profile_path":"/gk0VN84CbpRwdh9mO7d2EcoQyEJ.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Anatole","credit_id":"54a8609d9251414d6d0022d6","id":25048,"name":"Yves Afonso","order":9,"profile_path":"/jHQ9wteH65GnjpUZlqnkYezwdhH.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"54a860b0c3a3680c3300218a","id":1408489,"name":"Christian Van Cau","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"La maîtresse de maison","credit_id":"54a860c39251414d5d002641","id":104087,"name":"Marthe Mercadier","order":11,"profile_path":"/iPYDq0jJWNZNLDPVg5Gi6zhHxQc.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Le maître de maison","credit_id":"54a860e99251414d630025a4","id":39152,"name":"Yves Vincent","order":12,"profile_path":"/6C6SqIPqh6pQOZ1EVj3Sk6zyqry.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"La monitrice","credit_id":"54a86124c3a3680c3300219a","id":1408490,"name":"Marie-Elisabeth Prouvost","order":13,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Antoine","credit_id":"54a861549251414d6a002498","id":582274,"name":"Jean-Claude Rémoleux","order":14,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"54a8616e9251414d630025b3","id":1408491,"name":"Bernard Mounier","order":15,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a85f1dc3a3680c21002860","department":"Directing","id":543364,"job":"Director","name":"Pascal Aubier","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
