One night, he escorts an injured gun robber to the government hospital, where he unexpectedly meets his old friend from college time, Dr. Jaw, now a reputed surgeon with an aspiration for senior management. To Jaw's bitter surprise, he finds himself outshone by Lau's medical talent and kindness to patients. Jaw is however determined to speed up his career ascent at the expense of Lau.
