To break the case, they recruit Ginger, a young woman from an upper-class family to act as bait for the kidnappers and hopefully lead the police to their hideout. It may sound like a foolproof plan to the police, but Ginger's the one who has to risk it all.","popularity":0.024295,"poster_path":"/dWL1cleKf7V8tRfVqLyjnglBMMZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Derio","id":23967}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every man wanted her, no man could tame her!
