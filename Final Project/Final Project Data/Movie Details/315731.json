While she's in the throne room awaiting him, he's outside playing with guns, drilling his soldiers, and dallying with the wife of a new minister. The queen catches him kissing her, her husband figures out that something fishy is going on, and the king tries his best to proceed with his plans for a night out. The queen contrives to keep him cuffed in the bedroom: king, queen, minister, and coquette end up in a game of musical beds. Will his royal highness get his night out?","popularity":0.000239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"name":"Hal Roach Studios","id":2159}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The King","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"The King","credit_id":"54aa5ec5925141580e001278","id":1022678,"name":"Harry Langdon","order":1,"profile_path":"/jXBL26mj80EF1DjTqhTQdhkUXct.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"The Queen","credit_id":"54aa5ed6925141564600137a","id":97980,"name":"Thelma Todd","order":2,"profile_path":"/5t8g8JZkstv3nfP8HuHRVPdFKHr.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Lady in Waiting (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5ee89251414d670064eb","id":118258,"name":"Dorothy Granger","order":3,"profile_path":"/AnWsrn5pQQkch44n7OlVZKL9Jkw.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Guard (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5efac3a3680c21006f34","id":121125,"name":"Charles McAvoy","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"The Guard (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5f0cc3a3680c21006f39","id":1409239,"name":"Brad Michigan","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa5f1d92514155f2001376","id":140815,"name":"James Parrott","order":6,"profile_path":"/tug38sUl1qUnhquCjCyrjUrrQGX.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54aa5f3092514155f2001378","department":"Directing","id":131405,"job":"Director","name":"James W.
