Brief glimpses of family, friends, girl-friends, the City, seasons of the year, travels. Occasionally I talk, reminisce, or play music I taped during those earlier years, plus more recent piano improvisations by Auguste Varkalis. It's a kind of autobiographical, diaristic poem, celebration of happiness and life. I consider myself a happy man.\" - Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.001448,"poster_path":"/3aM4e5AhjX3HAWGz9YqFlYfDIVl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out-Takes from the Life of a Happy Man","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Jonas Mekas","credit_id":"52fe4c759251416c910f5817","id":1092208,"name":"Jonas Mekas","order":0,"profile_path":"/3IHLEy3OzVGK9no1lblrRpmt4rp.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4c759251416c910f5813","department":"Directing","id":1092208,"job":"Director","name":"Jonas Mekas","profile_path":"/3IHLEy3OzVGK9no1lblrRpmt4rp.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
