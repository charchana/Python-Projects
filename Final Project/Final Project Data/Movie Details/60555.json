Come morning, a posse arrives, forms up along the ridge, and takes for granted that everyone down below is guilty--fit for either shooting to bits or hanging from a tree, whichever comes first. Precisely half of Ride in the Whirlwind's 82 minutes is devoted to tapping the matter-of-fact, absurdist horror of that situation. In the remaining half, the two surviving cowpokes (Jack Nicholson and Cameron Mitchell) seek shelter at a farmhouse where they reluctantly threaten the farmer, accept breakfast from his wife, flirt with his daughter (Millie Perkins), play some checkers, and hope to remain undetected till nightfall.","popularity":0.455677,"poster_path":"/koT8zrcSbwEniUA4impWfGJ9MGH.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Proteus Films","id":38111}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ride with the Easy Rider into an action whirlwind.","title":"Ride in the Whirlwind","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":16,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"Vern","credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826c3","id":44728,"name":"Cameron Mitchell","order":0,"profile_path":"/59qGcBDKN1H4UysLaOEdV1PJter.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Abigail","credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826c7","id":26142,"name":"Millie Perkins","order":1,"profile_path":"/av89VopRGnsRRLgBCIt1hSKNd2g.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Wes","credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826cb","id":514,"name":"Jack Nicholson","order":2,"profile_path":"/hINAkm21g80UbaAxA6rHhOaT5Jk.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826cf","id":139612,"name":"Katherine Squire","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Evan","credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826d3","id":30987,"name":"George Mitchell","order":4,"profile_path":"/fJ7mUSVJPXgKAgzNAei09d1fxQY.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Indian Joe","credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826d7","id":157211,"name":"Rupert Crosse","order":5,"profile_path":"/FM92sq0eXQHLmxFyG1fmSBBqSi.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Blind Dick","credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826db","id":5048,"name":"Harry Dean Stanton","order":7,"profile_path":"/fkl5iJYpKxSFGixyvAsBpLdDmqN.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826b9","department":"Directing","id":20921,"job":"Director","name":"Monte Hellman","profile_path":"/qVrEpO0OCsKOrs8SPESfMfqJfRN.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe462ac3a368484e0826bf","department":"Writing","id":514,"job":"Writer","name":"Jack Nicholson","profile_path":"/hINAkm21g80UbaAxA6rHhOaT5Jk.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"zh","iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"普通话","english_name":"Mandarin"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"Français","english_name":"French"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"hr","iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Hrvatski","english_name":"Croatian"},{"iso_639_1":"el","iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"ελληνικά","english_name":"Greek"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"pt","iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Português","english_name":"Portuguese"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":642,"name":"robbery"},{"id":7002,"name":"vigilante"},{"id":9503,"name":"outlaw"},{"id":14783,"name":"false accusations"},{"id":15290,"name":"pursuit"},{"id":15291,"name":"on the road"},{"id":15292,"name":"hanged man"},{"id":15295,"name":"confrontation"}]}}
