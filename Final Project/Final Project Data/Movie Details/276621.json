It was carried out by visionary 1960s neuroscientist John Lilly, who had a remarkable ambition; to communicate with dolphins by teaching them to speak English. The experiment was seized upon by NASA, who were embarking on the first serious search for extra-terrestrial intelligence beyond the Earth. When they detected a signal from ET, they would need to understand how to communicate with a species other than humans. Here, without leaving the planet, was the opportunity to practice such inter-species communication. But what started with â€˜60s idealism would spiral into the darkness of the decade, and end in tragedy, with rumours and scandal about drug abuse and a sexual relationship between Peter and Margaret. Fifty years on, this film tells the real story of just what happened at the Dolphin House.","popularity":0.005404,"poster_path":"/wAg0V10xVLZj4swnpF0VXovhja5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl Who Talked to Dolphins","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"58c3f69b925141342b003532","id":1229,"name":"Jeff Bridges","order":1,"profile_path":"/eronr4zagxsKCBkGsFBDBCOqyma.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"58c3f754c3a3681a4a003895","department":"Directing","id":1141886,"job":"Director","name":"Christopher Riley","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"hu","iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Magyar","english_name":"Hungarian"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
