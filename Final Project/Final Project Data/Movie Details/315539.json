However if she does not succeed within one year she will become as insubstantial as the wind. Down in the village, Yuki is befriended by a group of orphans whose parents have all been killed by the bandits and who now subsist by begging. Yuki amazes them by taming the wild horse Blizzard. She is instrumental in getting the orphans and farmers to stand up to first the warring bandits and then Goemon, the greedy lord that owns the region. But Yuki must face her greatest challenge yet when the displeased Demon God that lives in the volcano emerges to destroy those who live beneath.","popularity":1e-06,"poster_path":"/xYNsyemjtvri84sBu7gnL9eM0v5.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Mushi Production","id":20327},{"name":"Nikkatsu Children's Films Inc.","id":64796}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yuki – The Snow Fairy","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":3,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"56fbc997925141797300171c","department":"Production","id":1028357,"job":"Producer","name":"Takeo Nishiguchi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbc986c3a36808ac002830","department":"Production","id":1518650,"job":"Producer","name":"Satoshi Ito","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbca06c3a36808d70024df","department":"Writing","id":1598535,"job":"Original Story","name":"Ryusuke Saito","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbc98dc3a36808c2002792","department":"Production","id":1598534,"job":"Producer","name":"Saburo Watanabe","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbca13c3a36808c80025e0","department":"Writing","id":293744,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Akira Miyazaki","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbca8a9251415f45000972","department":"Sound","id":1598536,"job":"Music Director","name":"Chito Kawachi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcaac925141288800256c","department":"Sound","id":1598537,"job":"Songs","name":"Kuni Kawachi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcab492514102e1001522","department":"Sound","id":1598536,"job":"Songs","name":"Chito Kawachi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcad5c3a36808a70024c2","department":"Visual Effects","id":1409345,"job":"Animation Director","name":"Shinichi Tsuji","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcb129251415f4500098d","department":"Art","id":1580913,"job":"Art Direction","name":"Yoshiyuki Uchida","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcbb792514102e1001552","department":"Directing","id":1598538,"job":"Assistant Director","name":"Masanori Miura","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcc00c3a36808d7002579","department":"Editing","id":65443,"job":"Editor","name":"Harutoshi Ogata","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcc4892514102e1001582","department":"Sound","id":1598539,"job":"Sound Director","name":"Susumu Aketegawa","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"56fbcc8592514102e1001591","department":"Directing","id":938354,"job":"Director","name":"Tadashi Imai","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Yuki, Le Combat Des Shoguns"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1462,"name":"samurai"},{"id":170009,"name":"japanese soldier"}]}}
