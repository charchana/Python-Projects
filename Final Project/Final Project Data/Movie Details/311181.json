With his first book written as a way to heal after a broken relationship, Liam has slowly become disheartened with writing strictly for romantic fantasy, something evident to a sweet, but honest, journalist who reviews books, Sophie Atkinson (Amy Acker), whom he meets by chance on a plane. The two begin a tentative relationship in Sophie’s home town of Portland, Oregon, where Liam has come to find inspiration for his newest entry.  Liam’s agent puts him on the spot with a long-planned reveal of Gabriel August’s true identity, but Sophie doesn’t know of his public persona. The longer Liam avoids telling her the truth, the deeper a hole he digs for himself. Will their romance survive once his true identity comes to light?","popularity":0.165052,"poster_path":"/41VrGqwGJwzTuYWvyMCX79ZEGTL.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Larkin-Goldstein Productions","id":41289}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"True love in false covers.","title":"A Novel Romance","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":13,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"Sophie Atkinson","credit_id":"548df61ac3a36820ba004a82","id":81133,"name":"Amy Acker","order":1,"profile_path":"/gU5gDZGv4iaPTyt14YQItbsmPsU.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Liam Bradley","credit_id":"548df62fc3a36820b800539f","id":142206,"name":"Dylan Bruce","order":2,"profile_path":"/mbzxOy15D2RjGxhlYIwtgfms849.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Tabitha","credit_id":"548e0320c3a36820c5005298","id":59181,"name":"Emily Tennant","order":3,"profile_path":"/s7u9JSQWV3vll3ywpyCuacIVcPB.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"548e03f3c3a36820be0044e2","id":1399273,"name":"Tammy Gillis","order":5,"profile_path":"/mi8OsF6YoZlaODlszDLOXyvN3bg.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"54a057c4c3a368764f0073ea","id":17764,"name":"Charles S.
