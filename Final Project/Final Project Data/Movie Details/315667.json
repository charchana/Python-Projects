The first half of the film takes place aboard a French cruising ship, steaming through dangerous waters during WWI. Among the passengers is heroine Jeanne (Annabella), who was once in love with first-officer D'Artelles (Robert Vidalin) but he now seems strangely preoccupied. It turns out that the ship is on a secret mission, which ultimately dooms the vessel to a Lusitania-like death. After the sinking, Captain De Corlaix (Victor Francen) faces a court-martial, and it is at this point that the film clarifies several baffling plot points. Despite its complexity, the story is fairly believable, with the exception of the grafted-on romantic subplot.","popularity":0.00015,"poster_path":"/u99bGtyqSnNLBkwotgqLYnE6eTp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacrifice of Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a9c97ec3a368077b002da0","department":"Directing","id":143353,"job":"Director","name":"Marcel L'Herbier","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
