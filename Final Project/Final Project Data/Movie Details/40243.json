On the day of his university entrance ceremony, Makoto meets a fresh-faced, quirky girl named Shizuru. Makoto has a complex which causes him to shy away from contact with other people, but she succeeds in getting him to open up to her naturally. All Shizuru wants is to be with Makoto, so she takes up a camera too. The two spend their days together taking photos in the forest behind the campus. However, Makoto has feelings for another student named Miyuki. Shizuru decides that if Makoto likes Miyuki, she wants to like her too. She wants to like everything that he does. One day, she tells Makoto that she wants to take a photo of them kissing in the forest as a present for 'her birthday'. He obliges for her sake, and they kiss in the forest.","popularity":0.096242,"poster_path":"/t3qjXkRMgJ1gSFeVueDksmDvVVg.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Avex Entertainment","id":2788},{"name":"IMJ Entertainment","id":6953},{"name":"Shogakukan","id":9149},{"name":"Toei Company","id":9255},{"name":"Studio Swan","id":10765},{"name":"Sky Perfect Well Think","id":11814}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A relationship evolves between a photographer named Makoto, and two of his female university classmates, Shizuru and Miyuki.","title":"Heavenly Forest","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":20,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Makoto Segawa","credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc35","id":117974,"name":"Hiroshi Tamaki","order":1,"profile_path":"/in8Ph78ddt0JYyac3RcoEc7mb3d.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Miyuki Toyama","credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc39","id":94018,"name":"Meisa Kuroki","order":2,"profile_path":"/fOVqcwHehcY1HZzWZsnwxysdTIc.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Shizuru Satonaka","credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc4f","id":104522,"name":"Aoi Miyazaki","order":3,"profile_path":"/dHMFf5dLfOSUiCrz6A2vsqHYw3C.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Ryo Shirohama","credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc53","id":111640,"name":"Munetaka Aoki","order":4,"profile_path":"/14IAuejjPtOAyFHhkoPrBvSokQk.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Kyohei Sekiguchi","credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc57","id":84725,"name":"Keisuke Koide","order":5,"profile_path":"/sUUYp4pas5922YkFbedj7NMIDDu.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc5b","id":1058273,"name":"Yûya Ogawa","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Yuka Yaguchi","credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc5f","id":125942,"name":"Asae Oonishi","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Saki Inoue","credit_id":"5358c3cac3a36855f90099ab","id":1241458,"name":"Misa Uehara","order":9,"profile_path":"/o03EA6cTOkwWWsPqZ0jbXepB9rc.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc3f","department":"Directing","id":123885,"job":"Director","name":"Takehiko Shinjō","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4589c3a36847f80ccc45","department":"Production","id":123889,"job":"Producer","name":"Toshiya Nomura","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"575d16ce9251412443000fa2","department":"Editing","id":555280,"job":"Editor","name":"Yoshifumi Fukazawa","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"575d169292514162bd000423","department":"Writing","id":130647,"job":"Novel","name":"Takuji Ichikawa","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"575d169ac3a3684b3100073b","department":"Writing","id":124400,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Kenji Bando","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"575d16a9c3a36831a4002a55","department":"Production","id":127886,"job":"Producer","name":"Hiroaki Miki","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"575d16c1c3a36813510010e0","department":"Camera","id":123890,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Mitsuru Komiyama","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Heavenly Forest"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Tada, kimi wo aishiteru"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Simplesmente, eu te amo"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Simplesmente te amando!"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"ru","iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Pусский","english_name":"Russian"},{"iso_639_1":"zh","iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"普通话","english_name":"Mandarin"},{"iso_639_1":"ja","iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"日本語","english_name":"Japanese"},{"iso_639_1":"nl","iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Nederlands","english_name":"Dutch"},{"iso_639_1":"pt","iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Português","english_name":"Portuguese"},{"iso_639_1":"ko","iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"한국어/조선말","english_name":"Korean"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":907,"name":"japanese"},{"id":1925,"name":"camera"},{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"}]}}
