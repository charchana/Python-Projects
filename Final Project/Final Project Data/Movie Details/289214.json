Panic ensues all up and down the western coast of North and South America. In an attempt to lessen its impact, scientists launch an underwater explosion that inadvertently makes the tsunami more powerful and focused on Los Angeles. Scientists rush to a solution while the military begins planning for the worst. Los Angeles begins emergency evacuation. Lives and loves are lost even as a brash young grad student comes up with a solution: start the mother of all earthquakes to counter the rushing torrent and raise the continental shelf off the coast of the United States.","popularity":0.189326,"poster_path":"/rTbWzMzU0qk03kSyiH28dhmMxfi.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Infinite Spectrum Productions","id":3682},{"name":"Tom Cat Films","id":6766}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One good disaster deserves another.","title":"Disaster Wars: Earthquake vs. Tsunami","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":8,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"Colonel Brayman","credit_id":"561d82cd92514142c9000141","id":97823,"name":"Joe Estevez","order":1,"profile_path":"/6Ffb7SrCuRRK6iq9OhvLzB3OG7x.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Vice President Taylor","credit_id":"561d82f1c3a3686cd6000137","id":23648,"name":"Priscilla Barnes","order":2,"profile_path":"/llDEiCLnmEm68b658dv29Bh2wtR.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Jeff Taylor","credit_id":"561d831b92514142b800022c","id":97939,"name":"Reggie Bannister","order":3,"profile_path":"/4ayBwRs64wGiCpj2HXHGw3HIO9K.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Vickers","credit_id":"561d8347c3a3686cc300016d","id":1522227,"name":"Pete Punito","order":4,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"561d83a192514142cc00012c","department":"Writing","id":1134760,"job":"Writer","name":"Se√°n Lee","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"561d837992514142bf00014e","department":"Directing","id":229006,"job":"Director","name":"David Palmieri","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","iso_639_1":"de","release_date":"2015-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Stormageddon: Earthquake vs Tsunami"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
