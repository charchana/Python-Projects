They're hot on the trail near a gas station operated by Harry, a seemingly slow witted fellow with a cheery and spunky girlfriend. A shootout between treasury agents and the gang - they transport the hooch in manikins seated in a touring car - takes place in front of Harry's filling station. While Harry's gal stays outside, Harry carries the liquor-filled dummies into the station. Will there be a reward for the heroics of Harry and his honey?","popularity":0.000245,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"name":"Hal Roach Studios","id":2159}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Kick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"54aa62ff925141580e0012db","id":1022678,"name":"Harry Langdon","order":1,"profile_path":"/jXBL26mj80EF1DjTqhTQdhkUXct.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Detective","credit_id":"54aa6312c3a3680c21006fa7","id":30018,"name":"Edgar Kennedy","order":2,"profile_path":"/nCun7c3czorbRoK2kxqaz9BjyPg.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Harry's Girl (as Nancy Dover)","credit_id":"54aa632ac3a368241e000fa8","id":987037,"name":"Judith Barrett","order":3,"profile_path":"/3ErPaJd8b9S2NwGbDPOXa8uEFda.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa633ec3a36824c20012b5","id":1041513,"name":"Eddie Baker","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa63abc3a3684091000436","id":1056240,"name":"Jack Hill","order":6,"profile_path":"/jY5R3dmvmjZOUJkE4dHuMgza2Z2.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"1st Bootlegger (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa63bec3a3684091000439","id":137405,"name":"Bob Kortman","order":7,"profile_path":"/n8rmEFRPwJOsuyguYWh9HY7lpbB.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"2nd Bootlegger (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa63d09251414d6300672d","id":141008,"name":"Sam Lufkin","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa63e2c3a368077b004332","id":121125,"name":"Charles McAvoy","order":9,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Motorist with Noisy Jalopy (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa641d92514156460013e4","id":29272,"name":"Nelson McDowell","order":10,"profile_path":"/n1W6fMFJ1RCSsvMdeT5WF9nB1DU.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa642e9251415679001359","id":587830,"name":"Bob O'Connor","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Bootlegger (uncredited)","credit_id":"54aa643f9251414d6300673b","id":161702,"name":"Julian Rivero","order":12,"profile_path":"/lYFhu9W0Z1Sqjg417zXJtfXNEOR.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54aa645b9251414d67006552","department":"Directing","id":1363023,"job":"Director","name":"Warren Doane","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aa646ac3a3680c21006fc0","department":"Writing","id":131383,"job":"Writer","name":"H.M.
