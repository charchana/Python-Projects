Harry Haller, a solitary intellectual, has all his life feared his dual nature of being human and being a beast. He's decided to die on his 50th birthday, which is soon. He's rescued from his solipsism by the mysterious Hermine, who takes him dancing, introduces him to jazz and to the beautiful and whimsical Maria, and guides him into the hallucinations of the Magic Theater, which seem to take him into Hell. Can humour, sin, and derision lead to salvation?","popularity":0.000926,"poster_path":"/2m9hQWwRMhmyx8sUKlGVCU0lIt0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"For madmen only.","title":"Steppenwolf","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Harry Haller","credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110e85","id":2201,"name":"Max von Sydow","order":0,"profile_path":"/nwRB1DDylWFC4120kfbtPq2pZzA.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Hermine","credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110ea7","id":24590,"name":"Dominique Sanda","order":1,"profile_path":"/qNLSPZshmNb5j63iCwiKLd10JPI.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Pablo","credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110eab","id":17577,"name":"Pierre Clémenti","order":2,"profile_path":"/knoMVwKuw2dGAgs1s3l460J9iXc.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110eaf","id":33863,"name":"Carla Romanelli","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Aztec","credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110eb3","id":1044225,"name":"Roy Bosier","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Dora","credit_id":"57e91b22c3a36835a201bb5f","id":1076692,"name":"Silvia Reize","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Franz","credit_id":"57e91b3bc3a368475d012fa2","id":37974,"name":"Helmut Förnbacher","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Loering","credit_id":"57e91b47c3a3687c5c007266","id":37411,"name":"Sunnyi Melles","order":7,"profile_path":"/alnr6zuJ3dI5EEFBy6INVP3afjF.jpg"},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Rosa","credit_id":"57e91ba792514168e90024a7","id":37411,"name":"Sunnyi Melles","order":8,"profile_path":"/alnr6zuJ3dI5EEFBy6INVP3afjF.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110e8b","department":"Directing","id":254234,"job":"Director","name":"Fred Haines","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110e91","department":"Writing","id":573548,"job":"Writer","name":"Hermann Hesse","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110e97","department":"Writing","id":254234,"job":"Writer","name":"Fred Haines","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110e9d","department":"Production","id":573549,"job":"Producer","name":"Melvin Fishman","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48e6c3a368484e110ea3","department":"Production","id":573550,"job":"Producer","name":"Richard Herland","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Степной волк"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El lobo estepario"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"hu","iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Magyar","english_name":"Hungarian"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188,"name":"buddhism"},{"id":10706,"name":"spirituality"},{"id":161279,"name":"mysticism"}]}}
