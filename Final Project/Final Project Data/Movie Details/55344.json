The film is based on a manga by Kengo Hanazawa which was originally serialized in Shogakukan’s Big Comic Spirits from 2005-2008, and although the adaptation is fairly loyal visually, the overall tone has been changed both in how the characters behave and how the story arc is presented.","popularity":0.002447,"poster_path":"/A9NMAebBEg6vIoR5duYQpcA0T2L.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Amuse Soft Entertainment","id":3219},{"name":"Shogakukan Production","id":5261}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2010-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys on the Run","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":6,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1002,"character":"Toshiyuki tanishi","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178ee9","id":224405,"name":"Kazunobu Mineta","order":0,"profile_path":"/1Yw4x8srtg3qcnFU1uOEeAlpxZl.jpg"},{"cast_id":1003,"character":"Chiharu","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178eed","id":224406,"name":"Mei Kurokawa","order":1,"profile_path":"/tisv1ZKqDKllq3Tkt4p8dEkFuNs.jpg"},{"cast_id":1004,"character":"Aoyama","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178ef1","id":72932,"name":"Ryuhei Matsuda","order":2,"profile_path":"/h5LaFzOmcIufsD0i0nv12AG00Mo.jpg"},{"cast_id":1006,"character":"Tanaka","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178ef5","id":137028,"name":"Denden","order":3,"profile_path":"/c92aFu9FoK6IXw64QixuJPqOjii.jpg"},{"cast_id":1007,"character":"President","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178ef9","id":123739,"name":"Lily Franky","order":4,"profile_path":"/89zD5TxmyVh9jPF1etzV2p7FItM.jpg"},{"cast_id":1008,"character":"Suzuki san","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178efd","id":20332,"name":"Kaoru Kobayashi","order":5,"profile_path":"/ao6ahEACiVZuQAQ2ysL7DSbRwfS.jpg"},{"cast_id":1009,"character":"Shiho","credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178f01","id":25653,"name":"You","order":6,"profile_path":"/6dswSDzyxe1CBNLL0RUknx2iuUi.jpg"},{"cast_id":1010,"character":"","credit_id":"54a57a2bc3a3682f21014cb3","id":58611,"name":"Kiyohiko Shibukawa","order":7,"profile_path":"/vpu1zIO83QhKjlsb9Qo1XcuXHmV.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178edf","department":"Directing","id":224403,"job":"Director","name":"Daisuke Miura","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe48c7c3a36847f8178ee5","department":"Writing","id":224404,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Daisuke Miura","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Bôizu on za ran"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"pt","iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Português","english_name":"Portuguese"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13141,"name":"based on manga"},{"id":222417,"name":"big comic spirits"}]}}
