Star is the center of her universe when she discovers how small it really is. Paths cross between those climbing up the ladder, those falling off, and those putting the ladder away. This fresh, contemporary film offers the sounds of classical, rock, and bluegrass colliding as lives intersect, resulting in a new sound, a new life, a new beginning. In the end, Star discovers that the art to fine tuning her life is much like tuning a violin so she is in harmony with those around her, as she finds the family she never had.","popularity":0.001059,"poster_path":"/oac7LBb7NlQNQNYvNBZIC64Wmji.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Fine Tuned","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":4,"character":"Star","credit_id":"54ae9e0bc3a36817f000057e","id":237424,"name":"Victoria Emmons","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Mary Madison","credit_id":"54ae9e27c3a36877440004e7","id":1410702,"name":"Virginia Tucker","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Jim Madison","credit_id":"54ae9e3d92514113fa0017a4","id":1410703,"name":"Brandon Millett","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Cassie","credit_id":"54ae9e53c3a368399e001efc","id":1410704,"name":"Jennie Marie O'Keefe","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Joshua Madison","credit_id":"54ae9eb2c3a368070f000565","id":1410705,"name":"Scott Clark","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Martha Madison","credit_id":"54ae9ecfc3a368666a001ade","id":1410707,"name":"Kristine Cornils","order":6,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54ae9d74c3a368666a001ab5","department":"Directing","id":1410699,"job":"Director","name":"Nina May","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54ae9dbcc3a368399e001ee8","department":"Writing","id":1410699,"job":"Writer","name":"Nina May","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54ae9d9c92514169e0001f07","department":"Production","id":1410699,"job":"Producer","name":"Nina May","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
