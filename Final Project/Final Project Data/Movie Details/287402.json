After all, he is surrounded by women clamoring for time with him in bed. So are all the other men in the story. When one of his sons dies suddenly during an operation, Paul is devastated and cannot make out what has gone wrong in his life. None of his current crop of friends has any insight to offer. Some of these questions become clearer when his sister, with whom he is almost unnaturally close, comes to visit.","popularity":3e-06,"poster_path":"/yuTKDZClEamOvVXBXhOabFE7zS3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1987-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Odyssey of Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"Paul Henkes","credit_id":"53f212eac3a3685af2004d87","id":113590,"name":"Herbert Flack","order":1,"profile_path":"/jIOPfpEGxfHMqZUxROcSrKAc1Qx.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Elizabeth Henkes","credit_id":"53f21320c3a3685aed004cce","id":1354093,"name":"Sarah Brackett","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Valerie","credit_id":"53f2134fc3a3685aff004d4e","id":577453,"name":"Patty Brard","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Zippy","credit_id":"53f2135bc3a3685af8004c8a","id":69338,"name":"Liz Snoyink","order":4,"profile_path":"/1zepUUSF8dAblgMfY0XwOAaJ8fb.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Ramon","credit_id":"53f2136cc3a3685af8004c91","id":1354094,"name":"Eddie Marchena","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Nicholas","credit_id":"53f21378c3a3685aed004ce5","id":1354095,"name":"Ramon Todd Dandare","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Ramona","credit_id":"53f21392c3a3685af2004d94","id":557682,"name":"Devika Strooker","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Dr. Alexander De Winter","credit_id":"53f213a6c3a3685aed004ced","id":24554,"name":"John van Dreelen","order":9,"profile_path":"/emSDgRAf8Exhps52QMdqPPnWGdL.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Aida","credit_id":"53f213b2c3a3685add004be4","id":1354097,"name":"Mavis Helneyer","order":10,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Isabela","credit_id":"53f213c2c3a3685ad900524e","id":1354099,"name":"Lilian van Everdingen","order":11,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Koningin van de Nacht","credit_id":"53f213d5c3a3685af2004d9b","id":1354100,"name":"Laura Quast","order":12,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Cecilia","credit_id":"53f213e6c3a3685aff004d58","id":1354101,"name":"Myrena Sint Jago","order":13,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Waldo","credit_id":"53f213f6c3a3685ae7005044","id":1354102,"name":"Kenneth Hardigein","order":14,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Belinda","credit_id":"53f21402c3a3685af8004c9d","id":1354103,"name":"Monifa King","order":15,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Bart Buisman","credit_id":"54aa5d4c925141580e001258","id":7572,"name":"Thom Hoffman","order":16,"profile_path":"/jUHJ3ettpi4nCTEO14W8fRfCsn3.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"58238f89c3a368330b010b35","department":"Directing","id":543238,"job":"Director","name":"Pim de la Parra","profile_path":"/3Sub4BaEIzKdDVc7CkmRUlJsPQh.jpg"},{"credit_id":"53f21259c3a3685add004bc8","department":"Writing","id":1054631,"job":"Writer","name":"Dorna van Rouveroy","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"58238f919251410cbe010f43","department":"Writing","id":543238,"job":"Writer","name":"Pim de la Parra","profile_path":"/3Sub4BaEIzKdDVc7CkmRUlJsPQh.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4320,"name":"lover"}]}}
