Stunned at how basic the production is, Vera attempts to back out, but is convinced by some of the locals to give their town a chance.  To her surprise, the warmth and charm of the small town grows on Vera and she even enjoys the experience of directing the pageant. When Vera discovers her former fiancé Jack (Robert Mailhouse) recommended her for the job, she is outraged. But over time Vera appreciates the gesture, as she grows close to both Jack and his young daughter (Lennon Wynn).
