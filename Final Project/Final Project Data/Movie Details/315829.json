When the train is robbed, everyone thinks that Cotton and Violet were the ones that did the job, but no one has any proof. US Marshal Lloyd Richland comes into town in disguise to find the truth and he finds that the sheriff is corrupt and that the Goss family is gosh darn nice. They take in Richland and a stranded woman named Mary without any questions. Cotton believes that Sheriff Tatum shot their pa in the back, and the sheriff is now trying to plug the boys. Richland is looking for the train robbers, and at the same time is keeping an eye on Tatum and the lovely young Mary.","popularity":0.000153,"poster_path":"/9ltu8sbawLtLTmjvcb19RD41dM6.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","id":8411}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ROMANCE RIDES THE TRAIL OF A THOUSAND THRILLS!","title":"Gentle Annie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":8,"character":"Lloyd Richland aka Rich Williams","credit_id":"54aaed53c3a368241e001a2c","id":82860,"name":"James Craig","order":1,"profile_path":"/8CunQATdgoNpj69xTTtxXDDxh1n.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Lingen","credit_id":"54aaed639251415646002127","id":17752,"name":"Donna Reed","order":2,"profile_path":"/jGSZJKut5cOHqiKnz6cC0AMol7v.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Cottonwood Goss","credit_id":"54aaed78c3a36824c2001fdb","id":4073,"name":"Harry Morgan","order":3,"profile_path":"/xQlBwecEQEz84k7jDLPGi6FqxRJ.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Annie Goss","credit_id":"54aaed8bc3a3682352002166","id":13996,"name":"Marjorie Main","order":4,"profile_path":"/mW1zCPseAu6COanItyUiELg8BbO.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Violet Goss","credit_id":"54aaed9d925141564600212e","id":97145,"name":"Paul Langton","order":5,"profile_path":"/ooHBhfcVWTEjKBYZebnsQQgv9fz.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Sheriff Tatum","credit_id":"54aaedaec3a36822b70022d3","id":14451,"name":"Barton MacLane","order":6,"profile_path":"/vmfmiGO6cusQn9B8jw9oLPnSYr6.jpg"},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Barrow","credit_id":"54aaedc19251415757001ff8","id":14980,"name":"John Philliber","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Deputy Gansby","credit_id":"54aaedd09251417e0600447d","id":81182,"name":"Morris Ankrum","order":8,"profile_path":"/vbZl5cWCIK2Y6tpIPfv1nBFhgSl.jpg"},{"cast_id":16,"character":"Hansen","credit_id":"54aaeddf9251415646002133","id":128324,"name":"Noah Beery","order":9,"profile_path":"/qmib8fQCWTBOsSEpCzjuawz3tgf.jpg"},{"cast_id":17,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"54aaedeec3a3682352002176","id":116661,"name":"Frank Darien","order":10,"profile_path":"/y2ZwI7fYSxJK12N4vOqqRX2Uq3n.jpg"},{"cast_id":18,"character":"Childers - Bartender","credit_id":"54aaee04c3a3680c21007e43","id":10806,"name":"Robert Emmet O'Connor","order":11,"profile_path":"/jtROo0QH1WIT8pLQa16JYA7cjsE.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54aaeca892514155f20020bd","department":"Directing","id":57142,"job":"Director","name":"Andrew Marton","profile_path":"/nY91bRdDR6MfgUhEst0tzHEevfG.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54aaecb7925141564600211a","department":"Writing","id":148562,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Lawrence Hazard","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aaeccb9251414d6700725a","department":"Writing","id":1052135,"job":"Writer","name":"Gene Fowler","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aaecdc925141564600211c","department":"Production","id":117721,"job":"Producer","name":"Robert Sisk","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aaeced9251415757001fed","department":"Camera","id":103364,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Charles Salerno Jr.","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aaecfb9251414d63007484","department":"Camera","id":1002959,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Walter Lundin","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"570a31c1c3a3687796003fd4","department":"Art","id":9062,"job":"Art Direction","name":"Cedric Gibbons","profile_path":"/w8tc9iVH87Iu1KKFDZ9B99NhnBc.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54aaed27c3a36824c2001fd2","department":"Costume & Make-Up","id":1012329,"job":"Costume Supervisor","name":"Irene","profile_path":"/uqKuNQzRIV4OJQztp2AHuhitWuc.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":798,"name":"sheriff"},{"id":12371,"name":"gunfight"},{"id":156120,"name":"train robbery"}]}}
