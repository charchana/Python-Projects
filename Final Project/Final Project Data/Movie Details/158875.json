On the other side of town, Ernesto evades life at home with his current live-in ex-boyfriend by spending much of his spare time in the hospital with an ailing past love. Impervious to the monotony of their blue-collar world, they maintain an unwavering yearning for romance. The emotional isolation the two men have grown accustomed to is captured in a subtle, optimistic, poetic fashion while avoiding melodrama.","popularity":0.019121,"poster_path":"/jU9seWDIJcJcJCO6WWQ9LYNhqZG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pit Stop","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":9,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":4,"character":"Gabe","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eb9f1","id":963767,"name":"Bill Heck","order":0,"profile_path":"/g5YrdeF4BmtCqXVFk4lJtJkR4yG.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Ernesto","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eb9f5","id":991941,"name":"Marcus DeAnda","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Shannon","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eb9f9","id":139150,"name":"Amy Seimetz","order":2,"profile_path":"/p2wgr9uRF9rDTcorSW8lnpuYZyh.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Winston","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eb9fd","id":590984,"name":"John Merriman","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Luis","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eba01","id":578354,"name":"Alfredo Maduro","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Les","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eba05","id":1043044,"name":"Corby Sullivan","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Cindy","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eba09","id":1140237,"name":"Bailey Bass","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Linda","credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eba0d","id":71565,"name":"Heather Kafka","order":7,"profile_path":"/paoX2PhThZb8mNGik0P3F4NmnEZ.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eb9e1","department":"Directing","id":1036442,"job":"Director","name":"Yen Tan","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eb9e7","department":"Writing","id":592493,"job":"Writer","name":"David Lowery","profile_path":"/soYt2uITKFDaWPBhe3fft6jNyav.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe4bfa9251416c910eb9ed","department":"Writing","id":1036442,"job":"Writer","name":"Yen Tan","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54ab23619251415646002714","department":"Editing","id":1092597,"job":"Editor","name":"Don Swaynos","profile_path":"/AsIxaYoLbSNKCDzBX5o1exY3zSP.jpg"},{"credit_id":"560b822392514171a00048cf","department":"Production","id":1066750,"job":"Producer","name":"James M.
