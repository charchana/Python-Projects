Why does Bolton demand that his gallery \"monsterpieces\" speak for themselves? What does he do with that ornamental knife that he carries everywhere? Will Marcus ever learn how to operate the camera?","popularity":0.000329,"poster_path":"/KlaIisTBQhJeFG2aRToARO1i58.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Docurama","id":39},{"name":"SKA Films","id":13419}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film crew takes a look at the inspiration behind artist John Bolton's painting.","title":"A Short Film About John Bolton","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"John Bolton","credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d5257","id":203555,"name":"John O'Mahony","order":0,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Jonathan Ross","credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d5263","id":112046,"name":"Marcus Brigstocke","order":3,"profile_path":"/7nDq04bufnmgSNNQhb94qih5k03.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Second Girl","credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d526f","id":181419,"name":"John Bolton","order":6,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d5275","department":"Directing","id":23446,"job":"Director","name":"Neil Gaiman","profile_path":"/nHQNhEKIf40vov2mMn3h6Zoivqs.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d527b","department":"Writing","id":23446,"job":"Writer","name":"Neil Gaiman","profile_path":"/nHQNhEKIf40vov2mMn3h6Zoivqs.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d5281","department":"Production","id":61578,"job":"Producer","name":"Adam Bohling","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d5287","department":"Production","id":189613,"job":"Producer","name":"David Reid","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe49d89251416c750d528d","department":"Production","id":957,"job":"Producer","name":"Matthew Vaughn","profile_path":"/bW19nWbfIRQ8lNDkY3StXkF1qVg.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"pt","iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Português","english_name":"Portuguese"},{"iso_639_1":"ro","iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Română","english_name":"Romanian"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2483,"name":"nudity"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"},{"id":3993,"name":"inspiration"},{"id":5918,"name":"painting"}]}}
