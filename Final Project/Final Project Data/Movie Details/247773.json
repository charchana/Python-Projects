He's mostly there for the genuine boxers to spar with and his real job is dishing out hamburgers behind the counter of a lunch wagon. He's personable and boastful and a little dense, but he has all the right lines. 'I'll murder him!' is his catchphrase, consistently delivered as a throwaway thing. Pop Baldwin, who runs the local gym, thinks he's a palooka, but Pop's daughter Honey thinks he's going to make it big. Of course she's head over heels in love with him, so that really doesn't count; but before we know it, Pop gets hit by a car, she takes over the place and he's the only fighter who stays in her camp. Honey may be blinded by love but she isn't stupid. She teaches him a few tricks, puts him in the ring and he does good, but that prompts them to try to break into the New York fight racket and that doesn't work out too well. After all, he has a dame for a manager.","popularity":0.000152,"poster_path":"/jfBijj5UXgd98fG03qVWPG2Nuq5.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Columbia Pictures Corporation","id":441}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Timer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Cooky Bradford","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22ab","id":88581,"name":"Ben Lyon","order":0,"profile_path":"/lVeybw4aReJXr6aY9Rlrm1CYNie.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Honey Baldwin","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22af","id":19022,"name":"Constance Cummings","order":1,"profile_path":"/1wFLl5aq8tIa7zESVzW1LLiKa58.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Kay Mitchell","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22b3","id":97980,"name":"Thelma Todd","order":2,"profile_path":"/5t8g8JZkstv3nfP8HuHRVPdFKHr.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Catfish","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22b7","id":2501,"name":"Tom Dugan","order":3,"profile_path":"/kcQeZ7chbe3J9jlHjavc64Tp1BO.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Dan Wilson","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22bb","id":10806,"name":"Robert Emmet O'Connor","order":4,"profile_path":"/jtROo0QH1WIT8pLQa16JYA7cjsE.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Pop Baldwin","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22bf","id":8517,"name":"Charley Grapewin","order":5,"profile_path":"/d56Lm5YsoX7JoA9ImaEVZk67zi2.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Sullivan","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22c3","id":99350,"name":"Russell Hopton","order":6,"profile_path":"/9kFwKw9P3J0VyfzTTeQSUm0mx6n.jpg"},{"cast_id":9,"character":"Scrappy Martin","credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22c7","id":161484,"name":"Jack Miller","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Slim Dugan (uncredited)","credit_id":"57b56d52c3a36868220006d5","id":30530,"name":"Irving Bacon","order":8,"profile_path":"/oI6h1L5HvvXLacBIlKoHcXrHbhI.jpg"},{"cast_id":14,"character":"Fight Spectator (uncredited)","credit_id":"57b56d6892514137b0000475","id":121323,"name":"Bess Flowers","order":9,"profile_path":"/akbW8jJl8GSXFpixFaobMOqvNv4.jpg"},{"cast_id":15,"character":"Kid Melrose (uncredited)","credit_id":"57b56d7ec3a36868f00005f5","id":32430,"name":"Nat Pendleton","order":10,"profile_path":"/dOtnUOR6bKMkIkPANf4C6JQnXXt.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4f2ac3a36847f82c22a7","department":"Directing","id":77101,"job":"Director","name":"Edward Buzzell","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a6107ec3a3682f1b015dfd","department":"Writing","id":19019,"job":"Story","name":"Robert Riskin","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a610969251411f9000305b","department":"Writing","id":1015918,"job":"Writer","name":"Dorothy Howell","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5506fe2092514153ba002fcc","department":"Camera","id":34342,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"L.
