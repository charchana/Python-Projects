But Bibiane has not been especially happy in her work lately, owing in part to an unexpected pregnancy that led her to have an abortion. Bibiane tries drowning her sorrows in alcohol and drugs, and late one night, after several drinks too many, she hits a jaywalker while driving home. The pedestrian staggers away after the accident, and the next morning, Bibiane remembers what happened and is frightened at the prospect that she may have killed someone. When Bibiane reads a newspaper account the next day of a seafood delivery man who died in his kitchen after being struck by a hit-and-run driver, she's convinced she was responsible for the crime. Guiltily attending the man's funeral, Bibiane strikes up a conversation with his son, Evian, and soon the two have become romantically involved, with Bibiane unable to tell Evian her secret.","popularity":0.399134,"poster_path":"/ouM7H16aKd3IzvjHNcUmzezI5qq.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Téléfilm Canada","id":806},{"name":"Max Films Productions","id":7828},{"name":"Société de Développement des Entreprises Culturelles (SODEC)","id":9116}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maelström","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":13,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Bibiane Champagne","credit_id":"52fe45ad9251416c9103a951","id":8791,"name":"Marie-Josée Croze","order":0,"profile_path":"/geZ08Bzueh6qDEGGUR7jQgomLks.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Evian","credit_id":"52fe45ad9251416c9103a955","id":557284,"name":"Jean-Nicolas Verreault","order":1,"profile_path":"/5J0SMGyNXPR7f4t1i9Mf861UA8L.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Claire Gunderson","credit_id":"52fe45ad9251416c9103a959","id":139862,"name":"Stephanie Morgenstern","order":2,"profile_path":"/tI0rFYP0B6qRK4O4b44aI08rbsA.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Philippe Champagne","credit_id":"56bbaece92514144de00072e","id":943234,"name":"Bobby Beshro","order":3,"profile_path":"/1XgJxdbyvjdwkyTqlMOFdvg9X3e.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Fishmonger's employee","credit_id":"56bbb033c3a36860ec0006ea","id":227058,"name":"Luis Oliva","order":4,"profile_path":"/oLV9rwcrgrdsHLe7aFPCOv5kGI7.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Marie-Jeanne Sirois","credit_id":"56bbb04d92514144cf000743","id":1230532,"name":"Marie-France Lambert","order":5,"profile_path":"/ctoCvtjwPpyOMPZrZQmhxa54aWL.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe45ad9251416c9103a94d","department":"Directing","id":137427,"job":"Director","name":"Denis Villeneuve","profile_path":"/uRzwzBRJVqsFjlrvF53zYJhIJRI.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe45ad9251416c9103a95f","department":"Writing","id":137427,"job":"Writer","name":"Denis Villeneuve","profile_path":"/uRzwzBRJVqsFjlrvF53zYJhIJRI.jpg"},{"credit_id":"57aa1a4792514111aa001662","department":"Production","id":38517,"job":"Producer","name":"Roger Frappier","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1a4fc3a3680e4e001631","department":"Production","id":123561,"job":"Producer","name":"Luc Vandal","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1a57c3a3680e8c00162c","department":"Sound","id":1389444,"job":"Original Music Composer","name":"Pierre Desrochers","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1a5e925141388c007184","department":"Camera","id":982586,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"André Turpin","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1ac1c3a3680e4e00165f","department":"Editing","id":6995,"job":"Editor","name":"Richard Comeau","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1acb92514111fb001572","department":"Production","id":6997,"job":"Casting","name":"Lucie Robitaille","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1ad4c3a3680ed9001596","department":"Art","id":29456,"job":"Production Design","name":"Sylvain Gingras","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1adac3a3680ec5001572","department":"Art","id":29456,"job":"Art Direction","name":"Sylvain Gingras","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1ae2c3a3680ec5001575","department":"Art","id":1663834,"job":"Set Decoration","name":"Ginette Paré","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"57aa1aeb925141114a001780","department":"Costume & Make-Up","id":17394,"job":"Costume Design","name":"Denis Sperdouklis","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2001-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","release_date":"2002-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"Los Angeles Film Festival","release_date":"2001-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"Montréal Film Festival","release_date":"2000-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","release_date":"2000-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"Français","english_name":"French"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10183,"name":"independent film"}]}}
