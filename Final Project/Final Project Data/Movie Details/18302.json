Jang Seung-up (1843-1897), also called Owon, focusing on the years 1882 to 1897, when Korea was in political upheaval, caught between China and Japan, the conservative dynasty dying, and peasant revolt at hand. Jang, born poor, has genius; a merchant, Kim, becomes his patron, finding him a teacher. Jang must convince others that a commoner can have talent, then move beyond his ability to copy old masters and find his own style. He's bedeviled by a temper and alcohol, arguments with patrons as he seeks commissions, and relationships with kisaeng, particularly Mae-hyang, that start and stop. It's the life of a restless spirit producing great art.","popularity":0.247703,"poster_path":"/o5cUAwdoGsmuWIjDkFdYzpglyCY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2002-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painted Fire","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":9,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Jang Seung-up","credit_id":"52fe47729251416c75099b7f","id":64880,"name":"Choi Min-sik","order":0,"profile_path":"/abLCstRJLpuzG39KAiG7hD72zcn.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Jin-jong","credit_id":"52fe47729251416c75099b87","id":87553,"name":"Kim Yeo-jin","order":2,"profile_path":"/3FwuoCXCZnzWj7JhQVMpcbViecD.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"So-woon","credit_id":"52fe47739251416c75099b8b","id":86889,"name":"Son Ye-Jin","order":3,"profile_path":"/in7Egh7eHZwhKylcmALqhXEEC6K.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Kim Byung-Moon","credit_id":"52fe47739251416c75099ba7","id":17121,"name":"Ahn Sung-Ki","order":4,"profile_path":"/dvIQzEjQqf4FBkbQxYIQ5JybYSX.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Mae-hyang","credit_id":"5319b94b92514177ab0025e6","id":1299310,"name":"Yu Ho-jeong","order":6,"profile_path":"/nJRk7GmYSzCPQrbXsQ14axlqI5R.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe47739251416c75099b91","department":"Directing","id":87554,"job":"Director","name":"Im Kwon-taek","profile_path":"/dYwJwdCpiuvznJAjod0Y1L35UCX.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe47739251416c75099b97","department":"Production","id":87555,"job":"Producer","name":"Tae-won Lee","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe47739251416c75099b9d","department":"Camera","id":87556,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Il-sung Jung","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe47739251416c75099ba3","department":"Sound","id":87557,"job":"Music","name":"Young-dong Kim","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"청소년 관람불가","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Drunk on Women and Poetry"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chihwaseon"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Chi-Hwa-Seon: Painted Fire"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"취화선"},{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Strokes of Fire"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"ko","iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"한국어/조선말","english_name":"Korean"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"Français","english_name":"French"},{"iso_639_1":"zh","iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"普通话","english_name":"Mandarin"},{"iso_639_1":"hu","iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Magyar","english_name":"Hungarian"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
