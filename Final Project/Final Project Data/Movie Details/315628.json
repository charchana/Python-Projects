LeRoy Haynes of the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice &amp; Police Reform, Dan Handelman of Portland Copwatch, and Kent Ford, founder of the Portland Chapter of the Black Panther Party, the filmmakers explore alternatives to current policing practices and consider strategies for community safety that do not employ constant surveillance and unneeded violence.","popularity":0.004707,"poster_path":"/dWoybXBXCltZ1sdq50WV0OhW76U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arresting Power: Resisting Police Violence in Portland, Oregon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a99d07c3a3680c30005240","department":"Production","id":1408973,"job":"Producer","name":"Jodi Darby","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a99d14c3a3680c290051d0","department":"Production","id":1408974,"job":"Producer","name":"Julie Perini","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a99d2ac3a3680c33004700","department":"Production","id":1408975,"job":"Producer","name":"Erin Yanke","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54e8448bc3a36836d6001320","department":"Directing","id":1408973,"job":"Director","name":"Jodi Darby","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54e8449c92514111b8000c54","department":"Directing","id":1408974,"job":"Director","name":"Julie Perini","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54e844aac3a3684ea6000c6f","department":"Directing","id":1408975,"job":"Director","name":"Erin Yanke","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
