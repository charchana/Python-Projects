(Miroslav Hornicek) is a deluded young man who is convinced he is Faust incarnate. This turn of mind leads to some ludicrous situations, such as when he believes a woman is really a cat. Before he can be rounded up and interned wherever they keep people with this type of a problem, love enters his life and the clouds that obscured his vision begin to dissipate.","popularity":0.00036,"poster_path":"/e8eqfep33aQQzBNK4MMa3H68IgQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Filmové Studio Barrandov","id":1931}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Woman Butts In","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54c93cb9c3a36870900028e6","id":1093333,"name":"Miroslav Horníček","order":1,"profile_path":"/a9dV6rrYqpgjwediINrbVjmwKed.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54c93cc5c3a36874ac006589","id":544312,"name":"Jana Hlaváčová","order":2,"profile_path":"/sKzmoNJYEFIxPSnmV3SehMHFciZ.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54c93cf192514108c7001c64","id":73557,"name":"Rudolf Hrušínský","order":3,"profile_path":"/a1VX6vPGAAfKugQCZPRDZZhDGay.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"54c93d03925141678c0067ea","id":11733,"name":"Vlastimil Brodský","order":4,"profile_path":"/oOKmSZIwuCZIiWuzN51wMUsp6Gl.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"54c93d0fc3a36804480004e9","id":137020,"name":"Jiří Sovák","order":5,"profile_path":"/19XZcwHVmagpGOMp21B3HuBU7Ux.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"53a41dc7c3a3682a4b000e86","department":"Directing","id":229683,"job":"Director","name":"Zdeněk Podskalský","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53a41e48c3a3682a4b000e91","department":"Writing","id":1332219,"job":"Writer","name":"Frantisek Daniel","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"53a41e5dc3a3682a3c000e4f","department":"Writing","id":1332220,"job":"Writer","name":"Milos Václav Kratochvíl","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54c93d3fc3a36870900028f4","department":"Camera","id":1419874,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Jiří Šafář","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54c93d5592514108c7001c6d","department":"Sound","id":544515,"job":"Music","name":"Zdeněk Liška","profile_path":"/p0NU4GkUqyzcYOvlHsocvjgev6H.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"cs","iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Český","english_name":"Czech"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
