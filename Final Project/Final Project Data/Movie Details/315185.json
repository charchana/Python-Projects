Featuring the voices of Joe Strummer and the Clash from the time, and intercutting the raw and visceral footage of this iconic show, with telling moments from the BBC's New Year's Eve, Hogmanay and New Year's Day schedules of nearly 40 years ago, it celebrates that great enduring British custom of getting together, en masse and often substantially the worse for wear, to usher in the New Year.","popularity":0.006578,"poster_path":"/w8ZVV2F3KQMatf5uhyjk7m1Xzxq.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"BBC Four","id":16630}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Clash: New Year's Day '77","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54a5db98c3a3684d8f0085a0","id":58296,"name":"Joe Strummer","order":1,"profile_path":"/5auPjlX8QpoNhcpms2ZMNZ5AOiH.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54a5dbb09251411f900028d7","id":1192715,"name":"Mick Jones","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54a5dbb992514117dd0081a5","id":99278,"name":"Topper Headon","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54a5dbd9c3a3682f210156bd","id":96767,"name":"Paul Simonon","order":4,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a5db809251417fcb000587","department":"Directing","id":22669,"job":"Director","name":"Julien Temple","profile_path":"/ktxBwnWZHwbKuMngxwY3MyRotDR.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
