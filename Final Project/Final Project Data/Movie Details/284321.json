Benjamin Wilkes, an ex-psychologist who helped Manfred select redundancy candidates, is killed in the same way as Manfred, putting disgruntled ex-Brada employees in the frame, but a third slaying implicates a former patient of Wilkes, who has connections to the Stjarne family. A newly loved-up Isabelle and Pontius start to fool around whilst on surveillance, taking their eye off the ball and allowing this suspect to confront Claire.","popularity":0.008396,"poster_path":"/HCu9MvjHslojKL82DowkbfUh0V.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Svensk Filmindustri","id":6416}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wallander - The Heritage","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"54817a0bc3a36817a50059bf","id":85807,"name":"Krister Henriksson","order":1,"profile_path":"/pEVv5w5aTo9T42afI1U42T1543Q.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54817a12c3a36829a7005876","id":79196,"name":"Lena Endre","order":2,"profile_path":"/AqDZhToc9r7tixhz2PQy6MWoIYr.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54817a199251416e74005b3a","id":87663,"name":"Sverrir Gudnason","order":3,"profile_path":"/pK1DtT1bobBQd5MbHnl6whaGMd4.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54817a219251414efa005caf","id":93139,"name":"Nina Zanjani","order":4,"profile_path":"/enhsHioXbBEKtwtS15Duwc8cNjz.jpg"}],"crew":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Wallander - Arvet"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Wallander 24 - Arvet"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Mankells Wallander: Das Erbe"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"sv","iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"svenska","english_name":"Swedish"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
