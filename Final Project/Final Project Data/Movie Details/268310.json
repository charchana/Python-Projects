By some artifice of shrewd legal aid, Merritt manages to seize Harry's ranch under a bogus writ of foreclosure. Failing to get justice by his many letters to Merritt, Cheyenne Harry goes east and calls at the millionaire's mansion. At first, Merritt refuses to see him. Then, to cause amusement for his daughter, Helen, and her guests, he invites the \"uncouth\" westerner into his dining hall. He is sure that he will make some grave error in table deportment and afford them all a laugh. To the amazement of Merrit and the guests Harry's table manners are faultless. Then, to trick him into an embarrassing position, Merritt eats with his knife. Harry, realizing that it is proper for the guest to follow the example of the host, does likewise. He leaves the house chagrined but more determined than ever to get justice from Merritt.","popularity":0.000198,"poster_path":"/x1XZzSIMUBTrSgKcqIRnT7KPDLu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Gun Fightin' Gentleman","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53683b85c3a36812180051a8","id":30212,"name":"Harry Carey","order":1,"profile_path":"/woeYlrOMkrEBsATg1994pLuCihT.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"53683b27c3a36812120051b0","department":"Directing","id":8500,"job":"Director","name":"John Ford","profile_path":"/tGxbIGuQcW4N004ZIqNQ78k3C17.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1919-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Espa√±ol","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
