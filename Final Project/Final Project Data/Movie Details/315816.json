As a patient, he has struggled with recurring depression for years, and as a doctor he wants to find out why.  The search for the origins of his illness leads him into the realm of his own genes and casts light on the fundamental changes facing modern society as a result of the tremendous progress being made in the field of genetic sequencing. Along the way, he meets a host of people – researchers, artists, visionaries – who have developed their own very individual approach to genetic coding and are drawing attention to the social significance of genetic technology. The film does not restrict itself to a scientific view of the subject but also makes use of artistic visions and more playful approaches to genetic blueprints.","popularity":0.003524,"poster_path":"/xuvII3HMUxXmb4LaiRELL0nJ15H.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Dschoint Ventschr","id":18449},{"name":"Filmtank","id":41570}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das dunkle Gen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55ca040b9251410c4c001c66","id":1495919,"name":"Frank Schauder","order":1,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54aae371925141480b00020b","department":"Directing","id":1409454,"job":"Director","name":"Miriam Jakobs","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aae3809251414d63007397","department":"Directing","id":1409455,"job":"Director","name":"Gerhard Schick","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aae3969251414d670071af","department":"Camera","id":1409456,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Simon Guy Fässler","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aae3a19251414d670071b5","department":"Camera","id":1409457,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Philipp Künzli","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aae3b6c3a368077b0050b5","department":"Editing","id":1409458,"job":"Editor","name":"Gerhard Schick","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aae3c5c3a3680c21007d49","department":"Editing","id":1409459,"job":"Editor","name":"Miriam Jakobs","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"569e9cc9c3a36858ce0076a0","department":"Sound","id":54671,"job":"Sound","name":"Patrick Veigel","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54aae3e8c3a368241e0019a0","department":"Crew","id":1409461,"job":"Sound Recordist","name":"Christian Lut","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":894,"name":"depression"},{"id":6017,"name":"genetics"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":156810,"name":"science"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]}}
