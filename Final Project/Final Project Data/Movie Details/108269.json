A juggler takes in succession about a dozen eggs out of his servant's mouth. He breaks all the eggs into a hat, and after having beaten them up after the manner of a cook, he extracts an egg as large as the hat itself. As soon as he sets this egg on the table there appears a tiny dancing girl, full of life, as big as a baby's doll, and who performs on the table some beautiful stage dances. All of a sudden she increases to the size of a ordinary woman, and jumping on the floor she delights the audience with her turns. The juggler and the dancing girl disappear in the most extraordinary way.” (Méliès Catalog)","popularity":0.000552,"poster_path":"/11JjNDZue6dteS3TIxMAc1QYwqj.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Star-Film","id":7159},{"name":"Georges Méliès","id":37046}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1902-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marvellous Egg Production","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4a94c3a36847f81d63d3","department":"Directing","id":11523,"job":"Director","name":"Georges Méliès","profile_path":"/cjQ3IvPbkNArGjhj4dkGqEwOgdW.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1902-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Dancing Midget"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12605,"name":"eggs"},{"id":39741,"name":"magician"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":187256,"name":"ballerina"}]}}
