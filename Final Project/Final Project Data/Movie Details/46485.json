As the story unfolds, the audience is left wondering which one of these guys ended up in the ambulance, and why. The blues soundtrack is true to the nature of the music itself, and to the movie, as it's about heartache and longing, loving and losing, striving and failing.","popularity":0.001019,"poster_path":"/80xZZpt3kjyMaPvTYjqcYJuU5ri.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LA Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Bobby Gordon","credit_id":"52fe46f9c3a36847f811cdc7","id":97604,"name":"Kevin Rahm","order":0,"profile_path":"/m9trKbRKybeMhRprPdDDj610vr3.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Neil Schwartz","credit_id":"52fe46f9c3a36847f811cdcb","id":21290,"name":"Dave Foley","order":1,"profile_path":"/3M9Yj0vScFcDbpopseBWJm6FdzF.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Paul Cooper","credit_id":"5696fb5e92514154cf0009e8","id":31467,"name":"William Ragsdale","order":2,"profile_path":"/njtQMv0vm9uNzSdVTqjYTu1TzNd.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Jack Davis","credit_id":"5696fb7a92514154d8000926","id":52262,"name":"Sean Maguire","order":3,"profile_path":"/axVjykZUTmM4aFCsurslXAQZGjC.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"5696fbbfc3a3683afd0009f1","id":1904,"name":"Anthony Michael Hall","order":4,"profile_path":"/ui3mCBPiNiDlYvhztJ0F1onSB4j.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe46f9c3a36847f811cdc3","department":"Directing","id":167507,"job":"Director","name":"Ian Gurvitz","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"L.A.
