Rodney Freeman, the young black man who Daniel took into his home and raised as another son, has become a famous writer and offers to fly Daniel and Bobber to San Francisco and to pay for the surgery. Once in San Francisco, Daniel meets and falls for Briony Adair, a physical rehabilitation specialist who will be working toward Bobber's recovery. When therapy progresses slowly, Bobber invites Briony to come home to Canaan to spend Christmas with the Burtons and continue his treatment. Briony is a natural at caring for a thriving family, but Sarah, Daniel's daughter distances herself not wanting to dishonor her late mother's memory, and a disastrous Christmas visit drives Daniel and Briony apart. In the soul searching that follows, Daniel finds the strength to open his heart again and invite love back into his life.","popularity":0.099731,"poster_path":"/dqgpP6gPnxMWkuSWCZBsMi4IR1t.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Marvista Entertainment","id":6679},{"name":"The Hatchery","id":7613},{"name":"Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC)","id":8582},{"name":"Province of British Columbia Film Incentive BC","id":11567},{"name":"Baumant Entertainment","id":18518}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas Comes Home to Canaan","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":4,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Daniel Burton","credit_id":"52fe4dbd9251416c7513ef4d","id":78887,"name":"Billy Ray Cyrus","order":0,"profile_path":"/khqOckdG2uQDLtOPPA25y299wo0.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Briony Adair","credit_id":"52fe4dbd9251416c7513ef51","id":33336,"name":"Gina Holden","order":1,"profile_path":"/1yw48NuEtDQ6VC5TWAN86VJYMOX.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Sarah Burton","credit_id":"52fe4dbd9251416c7513ef55","id":59181,"name":"Emily Tennant","order":2,"profile_path":"/s7u9JSQWV3vll3ywpyCuacIVcPB.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Rodney Freeman","credit_id":"52fe4dbd9251416c7513ef59","id":210348,"name":"Matt Ward","order":3,"profile_path":"/fwGrvAJJi30gapwPIDTkk1BNYHf.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"DJ Burton","credit_id":"52fe4dbd9251416c7513ef5d","id":208069,"name":"Jacob Blair","order":4,"profile_path":"/8QbiqwUFim60IBZ2p22WoEs2e1w.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Bobber Burton","credit_id":"52fe4dbd9251416c7513ef61","id":83852,"name":"Liam James","order":5,"profile_path":"/jnwh2aN6rV4pp9FeZF4DuS9g5kd.jpg"},{"cast_id":19,"character":"Shoup","credit_id":"5603b72f92514122be0041ce","id":60606,"name":"Julian Christopher","order":6,"profile_path":"/hWEA8ZuRKjbrpUAo0BGPFMFgf2i.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"5471cd7a9251413813003bc9","department":"Directing","id":51932,"job":"Director","name":"Neill Fearnley","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5471cd8d9251413813003bcc","department":"Writing","id":462672,"job":"Writer","name":"Donald Davenport","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b629c3a36855260045d4","department":"Production","id":1391803,"job":"Producer","name":"Ted Bauman","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b63dc3a3685521004b20","department":"Sound","id":937693,"job":"Music","name":"John Sereda","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b64f9251416f0f00211b","department":"Sound","id":1105186,"job":"Music","name":"Paul Michael Thomas","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b66192514122c3003f91","department":"Camera","id":25361,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Tony Westman","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b67292514122cd0040b3","department":"Editing","id":1271268,"job":"Editor","name":"Lisa Binkley","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b685c3a3685532003c2f","department":"Production","id":63784,"job":"Casting","name":"Candice Elzinga","profile_path":"/r03Ef6Pc7uwos4Vsg4faajV3Dlq.jpg"},{"credit_id":"5603b69792514122be0041b9","department":"Art","id":61250,"job":"Production Design","name":"Phil Schmidt","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b6aa92514122cd0040ba","department":"Art","id":928271,"job":"Set Decoration","name":"Denise Nadredre","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b6bd92514122c0004189","department":"Costume & Make-Up","id":1391798,"job":"Costume Design","name":"Vicky Mulholland","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5603b6dec3a3685521004b30","department":"Directing","id":1460799,"job":"Script Supervisor","name":"Susan Williams","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"it","iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italiano","english_name":"Italian"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"},{"iso_639_1":"es","iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Español","english_name":"Spanish"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"Français","english_name":"French"},{"iso_639_1":"hu","iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Magyar","english_name":"Hungarian"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":156321,"name":"tv movie"}]}}
