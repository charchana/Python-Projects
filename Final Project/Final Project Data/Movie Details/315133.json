The Argentine film was heavily modernized, while the French version returns to Dumas' 19th-century milieu. Micheline Presle is excellent as Marguerite, the gorgeous courtesan who flits from man to man until she finds true love in the form of the much-younger Armand (Rolande Alexandre). Though he is willing to marry her despite her past, she is persuaded to forsake him, lest his reputation be ruined. The story then wends its way towards its famous tragic finale, as the consumptive Marguerite is permitted a few brief moments of happiness before her flame is permanently extinguished. Advertised as the seventh version of the Dumas classic, La Dame aux Camelias was certainly not the last.","popularity":0.000402,"poster_path":"/AnClY4jkqt6mfdC7IvzhTOlLkgi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La dame aux camélias","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a593e89251411f90002147","department":"Directing","id":237868,"job":"Director","name":"Fernand Rivers","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a593f592514135c80007fe","department":"Directing","id":29720,"job":"Director","name":"Abel Gance","profile_path":"/9JIyXenregGUUpxsggnKeQXefcD.jpg"},{"credit_id":"57ebf74bc3a36813d3000dd6","department":"Camera","id":10537,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Harry Stradling Sr.","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
