Robert E. Peary (Rod Steiger), a US Navy commander and shameless self-promoter, sets out through Arctic wastes in 1909 to discover the Pole, an expedition that many others have attempted but failed to complete. His principal rival is Dr. Frederick A. Cook (Richard Chamberlain), who insists that he'd already reached the Pole in 1908. Though the experts (and the US Congress) conclude that Perry was first, public opinion is firmly in Cook's corner--as is this TV movie.","popularity":0.001348,"poster_path":"/eHvQgzvomIQ7Dkbr3HiUq0U0xdk.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Robert Halmi","id":6740}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cook & Peary: The Race to the Pole","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":2,"character":"Frederick Cook","credit_id":"54a6de9f9251414b73000856","id":28906,"name":"Richard Chamberlain","order":1,"profile_path":"/eKdKTv9k15vz5ag6CqFF8eKXcvO.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Robert E.
