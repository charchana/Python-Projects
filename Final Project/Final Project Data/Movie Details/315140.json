She has kept her terminal diagnosis secret from everyone around her, her housekeeper and gardener, as well as her estranged son, Justin. As her health continues to decline, her doctor insists it is time to bring in a live-in nurse at home. Stubbornly proud, Norma rejects every candidate for the job straight away. That is until she comes across Emma Keating, who refuses to take no for an answer and whole-heartedly agrees to keep Norma’s secret.","popularity":0.008795,"poster_path":"/b4nzI35WpyrtmPbv0AtiQpVKRUQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Larry Levinson Productions","id":3282}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touched","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":4,"character":"Norma","credit_id":"54a59d17c3a3682f1e014bab","id":45863,"name":"Doris Roberts","order":0,"profile_path":"/4J9jniy4ZEd6NRTfkzq9prKoEIt.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"54a59cff9251411d5300f72e","id":77767,"name":"Rachael Carpani","order":1,"profile_path":"/imjkboHNPo1mKeqGvpbau1TZXxA.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Justin","credit_id":"54a59d0bc3a3684d8f007ea1","id":21429,"name":"Sam Page","order":2,"profile_path":"/dTU66tCHSEVqeOeC3HhZXzsP6RP.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Beck","credit_id":"5601c246c3a3685541000082","id":8874,"name":"Ernie Hudson","order":3,"profile_path":"/afs1f1odqUEisoBDZ5FQ9K1WPY2.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Henry Luther","credit_id":"5601c3ef92514122c300009c","id":68108,"name":"Chris Gartin","order":4,"profile_path":"/uhFnE7Nj1UnqmVGeZ75QKohGFXz.jpg"},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Amber Fells","credit_id":"54a59cefc3a3682f1b014fad","id":1225045,"name":"Elizabeth Bond","order":5,"profile_path":"/NzlLUnlg4GGL09o72IGAlQMMZ2.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Maria Luther","credit_id":"54a59d249251414e2800f7cf","id":83536,"name":"Tessie Santiago","order":6,"profile_path":"/rlXGlb4UeVynRutjs0DCNfftet3.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"5601763292514122900019d8","department":"Directing","id":83996,"job":"Director","name":"Bradford May","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5601c38d92514122d30000bc","department":"Camera","id":151127,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"James W.
