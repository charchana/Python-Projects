Together these three form a team of thieves who eke out an existence as pickpockets. After a botched job, Karl becomes unable to work, forcing Zobel and Lizzie to seek out a new partner. Lizzie recruits Rudolf, the boyishly charming town misfit. Reluctantly, Zobel allows Rudolf to join them but warns him to never break the golden rule: \"No exchanging of bodily fluids within the team.\" This dictum becomes increasingly difficult to live by as Lizzie's cravings and Zobel's own passions toward Rudolf intensify. Eventually, the golden rule is broken by Lizzie...and then again by Zobel (unbeknownst to Lizzie, of course). An intricate love triangle soon develops amongst the three that is shaped by deception, desire, and betrayal.","popularity":0.000406,"poster_path":"/oPZofzcDukLHqn7n1jsMigDy1FU.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"TLA Releasing","id":328}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1998-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trio","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"Zobel","credit_id":"52fe4ae8c3a368484e16d65f","id":26395,"name":"Götz George","order":0,"profile_path":"/nQEmtmexfWayo6mrSkjuDSsUpYD.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Lizzi","credit_id":"52fe4ae8c3a368484e16d663","id":49018,"name":"Jeanette Hain","order":1,"profile_path":"/icET9X1pV73INdR7YYZcYXJeCDU.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Karl","credit_id":"5368db460e0a2647db007eb7","id":37102,"name":"Christian Redl","order":2,"profile_path":"/5EgPM4u638LpzaSWIip2ixBJyCw.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Wirtin","credit_id":"5368db560e0a2647d4007d3c","id":38969,"name":"Tana Schanzara","order":3,"profile_path":"/dE1EGNmmnjK6dmkA6NlHb2fgYqC.jpg"},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Schaffner","credit_id":"5368db660e0a2647d1007d57","id":36509,"name":"Ernst H.
