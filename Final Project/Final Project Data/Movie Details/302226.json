Doohan, Lawson, Mamola, Schwantz and Gardner made their marks on racing but even amongst these giants of the sport Rainey stood proud. Week-in-week-out, the riders engaged in high pressure wheel-to-wheel battles at some of the most iconic race circuits across the globe. Rewards for success were huge but the price to be paid for getting things wrong was severe - Schwantz broke both wrists, Doohan shattered his leg and Wayne Rainey, who tasted success more than most, now has to use a wheelchair following a horrific crash at Misano. This is the story of Rainey's adrenaline fuelled career with input from friends, rivals, managers, journalists and the man himself.","popularity":0.002863,"poster_path":"/7sFNua3gAzWxVN0Ih4pAapTbdC2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unrideables 2","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die wilden Jahre der 500cc Motorrad WM"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14735,"name":"motorcycle"},{"id":18185,"name":"bike"},{"id":34000,"name":"motorcycle racing"},{"id":171777,"name":"motorsport"}]}}
