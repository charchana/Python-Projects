Wong is once again responsible, as he casts Chan Bak-Cheung (Ah Leck) as the master of a prankster company who claims he was a student of the original Jing Goo, Stephen Chow. Chan takes in Oh My Gott (Eric Kot), a doofus nice guy who’s down on his luck after being tricked repeatedly by Chan’s rival (Lo Meng). Gott joins Chan’s trick squad, consisting of Dry member Mark Lui, wacky personalities Fast Beat &amp; Slow Beat, and the buxom Sherming Yiu. The team is hired by rich bastard Simon Lui to trick his half-sister, the amazing beautiful Lee Ann. However, she’s a pretty seasoned trickster herself, meaning that our heroes find themselves very busy. Meanwhile, Oh My Gott rediscovers Yandy (Athena Chu), the nurse he loved from afar many moons ago, who’s now working for Lee Ann.","popularity":0.000317,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"name":"B.O.B. and Partners","id":968}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tricky King","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":9,"character":"Tricky King","credit_id":"54ac8560c3a368077b007fae","id":990443,"name":"Natalis Chan","order":0,"profile_path":"/puVwqShdAK1upCPXGIqLgD9p2ii.jpg"},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Park","credit_id":"54ab2add9251415d20000105","id":1065055,"name":"Sherming Yiu","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"DKNY","credit_id":"54ab2aeec3a3680c210084e4","id":87942,"name":"Athena Chu","order":3,"profile_path":"/c0O8XWuDL82PotY8wyfSQrI13Jf.jpg"},{"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54ab2aff92514157570026a1","id":112982,"name":"Pinky Cheung","order":4,"profile_path":"/zPDdEBHFwCYyPkE839MW1wr2utk.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Ohmygod","credit_id":"54ae5aafc3a3682f9d0015ca","id":68561,"name":"Eric Kot","order":5,"profile_path":"/kBJnnO89ta6NiDfUndyHrpb23yi.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54ab2b759251415646002855","department":"Directing","id":270960,"job":"Director","name":"Aman Chang","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54ab2b9c9251414d6700791f","department":"Production","id":548474,"job":"Producer","name":"Wong Jing","profile_path":"/asZClP70V7W8zlFDzAzuQFGBZtC.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54ab2bdfc3a36824c20026b4","department":"Production","id":66765,"job":"Production Manager","name":"Fung Chi-Wai","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54ab2c1f92514155f2002771","department":"Art","id":1409581,"job":"Art Direction","name":"Raymond Gwok Siu Keung","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"IIB","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10267,"name":"comedy"}]}}
