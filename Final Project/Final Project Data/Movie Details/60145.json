Eldest brother Shang Moon is a philandering businessman who treats his hideous yet hard-working wife like dirt. Middle brother Shang Foon is a disc jockey/playboy who tries to score with as many girls as possible. Youngest brother Shang So is an obviously gay dance instructor. Moon soon gets the tables turned on him as his wife leaves to become a glamorous karaoke hostess, and Foon gets into a bizarre relationship with a fan so obsessed with movies that she constantly acts out characters on dates, until he suddenly becomes temporarily mentally ill. And So is continually at odds with obvious butch lesbian family cousin. Hilarity ensues.","popularity":0.272994,"poster_path":"/ibUSEGAKBJRWWax3nDyWCSNpR81.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Ko Chi Sum Films Company Limited","id":11109},{"name":"Mandarin Film Company","id":11110},{"name":"Regal Films Company Ltd.","id":11111}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1992-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All's Well, Ends Well","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":12,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":6,"character":"Shang Foon","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea61","id":57607,"name":"Stephen Chow","order":0,"profile_path":"/aizTZF5vHoOg6Ck7Nq5X65ULYoa.jpg"},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Shang So","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea65","id":69637,"name":"Leslie Cheung","order":1,"profile_path":"/jY0eInsklo9aYc1Som6vEdVd4OL.jpg"},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Ho Yok 'Holiyok'","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea69","id":1338,"name":"Maggie Cheung","order":2,"profile_path":"/eT5HNJT307Zg2PyMsgKdrtIlG3u.jpg"},{"cast_id":10,"character":"Leung Mo-Shang","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea6d","id":70590,"name":"Teresa Mo","order":3,"profile_path":"/xLOP9bjBPIBg6ChEB7czf3C7N8U.jpg"},{"cast_id":11,"character":"Ching","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea71","id":88495,"name":"Sandra Ng Kwan Yue","order":4,"profile_path":"/hIQWKC82xAQHvO5Cm4J31ZZLEEh.jpg"},{"cast_id":12,"character":"Sheila","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea75","id":565456,"name":"Sheila Chan","order":5,"profile_path":"/lJg7WUgxmyYGgSHMXsbtNy3cdNZ.jpg"},{"cast_id":13,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea79","id":148891,"name":"Lee Heung-Kam","order":6,"profile_path":"/uqTncumxOQJ9iVpGe0WyrOSoXOz.jpg"},{"cast_id":21,"character":"Shang Moon","credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea8b","id":240177,"name":"Raymond Wong Pak-Ming","order":9,"profile_path":"/1dbpTU3WKRaV0dBcAGxTsZ0zmIR.jpg"},{"cast_id":22,"character":"Foon's Girl","credit_id":"54a830349251414d6d001e94","id":1135177,"name":"Rachel Lee","order":10,"profile_path":"/ukZu4NKod2OjR4HMmXvbSEmYfFU.jpg"},{"cast_id":23,"character":"Grandfather","credit_id":"56bd60f19251417344001e1f","id":1135238,"name":"Kwan Hoi-San","order":11,"profile_path":"/hl5NPKaRtzRrlK7B86JwKR58VTn.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea4b","department":"Directing","id":123200,"job":"Director","name":"Clifton Ko Chi-Sum","profile_path":"/iElnJYe6SDvm3yZKKfnQPXvWna7.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea51","department":"Writing","id":1069018,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Roman Cheung","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea57","department":"Writing","id":1069020,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Ting Ting Choi","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea5d","department":"Writing","id":65934,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Vincent Kok","profile_path":"/mTtFWZKHYSKNaS7GHSuVho4THp.jpg"},{"credit_id":"52fe4619c3a368484e07ea87","department":"Writing","id":240177,"job":"Writer","name":"Raymond Wong Pak-Ming","profile_path":"/1dbpTU3WKRaV0dBcAGxTsZ0zmIR.jpg"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"家有囍事"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Family Happiness"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"All's Well End's Well"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"92家有喜事"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"가유희사"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Ga yau hei si"}]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"zh","iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"普通话","english_name":"Mandarin"},{"iso_639_1":"ko","iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"한국어/조선말","english_name":"Korean"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3451,"name":"housewife"},{"id":9253,"name":"slapstick"},{"id":9980,"name":"toilet humor"},{"id":184659,"name":"radio show host"}]}}
