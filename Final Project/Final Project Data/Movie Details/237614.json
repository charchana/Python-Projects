Frightened of being separated by child services following the death of their mother, a self-sufficient 16-year-old girl and her 10-year-old brother - who hasn't spoken a word since seeing his father killed by the mayor - strive to live off the land in peace. Their innocence is shattered, however, when a group of hunters led by the mayor's son brutalizes and rapes the free-spirited girl. Later, when a well-meaning social services worker arrives too late to protect the terrorized siblings, the girl and her brother prepare to take a stand against their ruthless attackers.","popularity":0.301734,"poster_path":"/7X0GiCvPo4yQRh76CpvJY0x9lsC.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Mountain Film","id":31307},{"name":"Dreamrunner Pictures","id":31308}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2013-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Season of vengeance.","title":"Autumn Blood","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":11,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":1,"character":"The Mayor","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f599","id":53,"name":"Peter Stormare","order":0,"profile_path":"/xP4uGTG2vEmVgSqYWpMsOUrTQBP.jpg"},{"cast_id":3,"character":"The Boy","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5a1","id":1272063,"name":"Maximilian Harnisch","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"The Butcher","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5a5","id":63764,"name":"Gustaf Skarsgård","order":3,"profile_path":"/twqsa4RjJi9WhaTfzYglz9rd2B0.jpg"},{"cast_id":5,"character":"The Hunter","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5a9","id":1053405,"name":"Samuel Vauramo","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"The Friend","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5ad","id":1105153,"name":"Tim Morten Uhlenbrock","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":10,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"54aabca89251415757001b86","id":103994,"name":"Sophie Lowe","order":6,"profile_path":"/1j1hpU09jAwJDe8x68Rx4JvOcfT.jpg"}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5b3","department":"Directing","id":1272065,"job":"Director","name":"Markus Blunder","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"538f5f79c3a3680d5e0003a1","department":"Camera","id":67356,"job":"Director of Photography","name":"Reed Morano","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"538f60b7c3a3680d750003d3","department":"Editing","id":1173410,"job":"Editor","name":"Joe Landauer","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54f382ae92514179a700023a","department":"Writing","id":1272065,"job":"Writer","name":"Markus Blunder","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54f382c99251417992000251","department":"Writing","id":1433945,"job":"Writer","name":"Stephen T.
