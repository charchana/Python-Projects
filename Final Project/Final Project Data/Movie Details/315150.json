Tom Powers (voice of Aldred) seems like an average eight-year-old boy. However, Tom has made an incredible discovery. In the woodland near his house is a special tree that houses Treetopolis, a city inside a tree trunk that he is able to access as a miniature version of himself and interact with the weird and wonderful small creatures of the forest. These include Twigs (Tennant), an acorn sprite, and Zigzoo (Tim Whitnall) the frog.","popularity":0.002538,"poster_path":"/aEMHBxwzpl7AJOi9RUiPFFjEWgq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"english","title":"Tree Fu Tom - Tree Fu Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"54a5a63dc3a3682f1b01506d","id":20049,"name":"David Tennant","order":1,"profile_path":"/4753hvSUCRiT1AwTAsTsN4yfZCQ.jpg"}],"crew":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]}}
