Videosyncracy follows three very different video rental stores as they negotiate their survival in three distinct Los Angeles neighborhoods: Old Bank DVD in the Downtown arts district, Vidiots in sunny seaside Santa Monica, and Eddie Brandtâ€™s Saturday Matinee in bustling North Hollywood. Their stories chronicle not only the birth and twilight of a particular kind of corner store, but also decades of personal lives intertwined with those of their communities, the new challenges and facilities of a rapidly changing world, and an enduring love of the movies, a slice of Americana on the brink of disappearance yet defiant to the end.","popularity":0.000918,"poster_path":"/3F1gPG4e0nhmH9FYBirazlDObIp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dare to be different.","title":"Videosyncracy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":0,"character":"Owner of Eddie Brandt's","credit_id":"54a9a0ebc3a3680c3300474e","id":1408988,"name":"Claire Brandt","order":1,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":1,"character":"Owner of Eddie Brandt's","credit_id":"54a9a0f49251414d67004d92","id":1408989,"name":"Donovan Brandt","order":2,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":2,"character":"Owner of Old Bank DVD","credit_id":"54a9a1039251417e06002279","id":1408990,"name":"Erik Loysen","order":3,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":3,"character":"Owner of Old Bank DVD","credit_id":"54a9a1169251414d5b005028","id":1408991,"name":"Mark Schumacher","order":4,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":4,"character":"Owner of Vidiots","credit_id":"54a9a1319251414d5d005164","id":1408992,"name":"Patty Polinger","order":5,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":5,"character":"Owner of Vidiots","credit_id":"54a9a142c3a3680c29005245","id":1408994,"name":"Cathy Tauber","order":6,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":6,"character":"Old Bank DVD Clerk","credit_id":"54a9a15dc3a3680c1c005186","id":1408995,"name":"Bree Wakeland","order":7,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":7,"character":"Vidiots Clerk","credit_id":"54a9a174c3a3680c1c00518b","id":1408996,"name":"Sean Schlemmer","order":8,"profile_path":null},{"cast_id":8,"character":"Vidiots Clerk","credit_id":"54a9a1839251417e800025ed","id":1408997,"name":"Ryan Marker","order":9,"profile_path":null}],"crew":[{"credit_id":"54a9a1a4c3a3680c1e004ef2","department":"Directing","id":1408998,"job":"Director","name":"Lulu Hansen","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a9a1b19251414d67004da3","department":"Directing","id":1408999,"job":"Director","name":"Nadia Nikolic Bowen","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a9a1ba9251417e800025f3","department":"Writing","id":1408998,"job":"Writer","name":"Lulu Hansen","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a9a1c39251414d70004935","department":"Writing","id":1408999,"job":"Writer","name":"Nadia Nikolic Bowen","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a9a1ce9251414d70004939","department":"Production","id":1409000,"job":"Producer","name":"Liz Singh","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a9a1dac3a3680c29005252","department":"Production","id":1409001,"job":"Producer","name":"Ian Ward","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a9a1e6c3a368077b002922","department":"Sound","id":1198032,"job":"Music","name":"Taras Tkachenko","profile_path":"/l8fvWT3CsOS4JoYwqyZ75Qw2GD9.jpg"},{"credit_id":"54a9a1f09251414d70004942","department":"Crew","id":1409002,"job":"Cinematography","name":"Jing Shao","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"5852ed1a9251416fa1025e65","department":"Editing","id":1723039,"job":"Editor","name":"Michael Cox","profile_path":null},{"credit_id":"54a9a20bc3a3680c1c00519c","department":"Editing","id":1409003,"job":"Editor","name":"Caitlin Starowicz","profile_path":null}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"translations":{"translations":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"English","english_name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"de","iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Deutsch","english_name":"German"}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1740,"name":"pop culture"},{"id":10073,"name":"documentary"},{"id":11616,"name":"vhs"},{"id":18239,"name":"home video"},{"id":34053,"name":"video store"},{"id":192086,"name":"rental"},{"id":208916,"name":"movies"}]}}
