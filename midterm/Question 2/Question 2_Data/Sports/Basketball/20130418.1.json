In his San Diego hospital bed, he assumed he would be chained to a wheelchair for a year or more. Walking seemed a distant goal. Running? He could barely comprehend the concept anymore. \n \nBut with the encouragement of therapists at the Naval Medical Center, Mr. Kremer was walking in two months, running in five and skydiving after nine. He did his first 10-kilometer race, about six miles, one year after stepping on the mine. Today he runs, swims or bikes almost daily and competes for the Navy\u2019s wounded warrior team in swimming, shooting, seated volleyball and wheelchair basketball.","abstract":"Prosthetic technology has advanced significantly over past decade, with computerized knees and ankles that adjust to terrain and activity; doctors know more about treating and salvaging limbs, making recovery faster than decade ago; advances will help those hurt in Boston Marathon bombings.
