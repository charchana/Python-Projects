He will be missed by his sister, Doreen Milcarek (Kenneth Burke), brother Kevin, niece Katharine and nephew Neil. Barry enjoyed his work and colleagues at the University of Delaware where he served as Senior Biostatistician in the College of Heath Sciences. Barry was an avid sports fan - he loved college basketball and football, but had a special love for youth hockey, where he once coached children, including his beloved son Rory. A private service is being planned. In lieu of flowers, if you would like to make a donation in Barry's memory, please give to St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, P.O.

Not surprisingly, the results have been inconsistent. Even within the same study, people respond quite differently to stretching, with some showing increased flexibility and others not.","abstract":null,"print_page":"25","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Fitness Oracle","kicker":"WELL"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2013-04-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Gretchen","rank":1,"lastname":"REYNOLDS"}],"original":"By GRETCHEN REYNOLDS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"51871e43cf28d05efe000e83","word_count":"2666","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
