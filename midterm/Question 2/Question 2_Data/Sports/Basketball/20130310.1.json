For the Brooklyn Nets, who invested heavily in putting together a winning team in their first season since their move from New Jersey, the pressure created by the team\u2019s owner Mikhail Prokhorov has seemingly distracted from what has otherwise been a successful move for both the Nets and Brooklyn.\n \nIn a sense, for anyone to talk about this season as a disappointment for the Nets is to ignore their recent history. Currently in line to be the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference, the Nets will almost assuredly make the playoffs for the first time since 2006-7, which was the last time the team finished with a .500 record. After years of being among the worst in the N.B.A. in home attendance, the Nets have filled 94.8 percent the Barclays Center\u2019s seats on average for a total attendance of 583,228 through Friday.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Nets Make Full Effort To Fit Into Brooklyn","kicker":"OFF THE DRIBBLE"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2013-03-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Benjamin","lastname":"HOFFMAN"}],"original":"By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5147153efdc5926e77000600","word_count":"569","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/10\/sports\/ncaa-title-game-in-63-began-a-half-century-of-change.html","snippet":"Readers respond to recent articles in the Sports section of The New York Times....","lead_paragraph":"Readers respond to recent articles in the Sports section of The New York Times.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"seo":"N.C.A.A.
