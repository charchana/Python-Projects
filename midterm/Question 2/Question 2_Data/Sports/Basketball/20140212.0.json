Age 65; of Valley Stream, New York, but Milwaukee, Wisconsin before that. Beloved and towering figure in the sports medicine community. It's hard to sum up a life in two words, but if you could, for Cathy, it would be: strong heart. Cathy was an influential practitioner of the Alexander Technique whose diverse array of students included members of the Metropolitan Opera, players for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and important figures in contemporary jazz. Before receiving her multiple professional accolades in her field (including a Master's Degree in Kinesiology), Cathy was a dancer. She would often tell strangers, \"I was a dancer, you know,\" as if her graceful movements and radiant beauty weren't proof enough. For the last seven years of her life, Cathy was also admired for what she called \"dancing my way through cancer.\" Having received a 6-months-to-live diagnosis nearly a decade ago, Cathy fought valiantly and beautifully and inspired countless patients, nurses and doctors to keep dancing. She died on her birthday. Like Moses. Cathy is survived by her two loving children Lukas Kaiser and Marissa Kaiser, as well as an insurmountable number of extended family and friends, colleagues and students who will feel her loss forever. Please send condolences to 344 Mill Road, Valley Stream, NY 11581.","abstract":null,"print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  KAISER, CATHY LYNN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KAISER, CATHY LYNN"}],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53057e8238f0d843b6dd8c6c","word_count":"217","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/02\/12\/sports\/ap-time-schedule.html","snippet":"All Times ESTTOP 25 BASKETBALLMen...","lead_paragraph":"\n              \n                <table><tr><th>All Times EST<\/th><\/tr><tr><th>TOP 25 BASKETBALL<\/th><\/tr><tr><th>Men<\/th><\/tr><\/table>\n              \n              ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Wednesday's Time Schedule","print_headline":"Wednesday's Time Schedule"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T08:23:55Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52fb768c38f0d812174eeb9b","word_count":"146","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
