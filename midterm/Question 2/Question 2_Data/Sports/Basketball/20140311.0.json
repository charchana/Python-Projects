A Hunter College graduate, she married and gave birth to two children in Brooklyn, before moving to Bergen County, NJ.

She was a music lover able to play many classical pieces on the piano. Reading nineteenth century literature, particularly the Lake poets, playing bridge, and a walking tour abroad were regular parts of her life. Expression of her athletic abilities began with participation on her high school basketball team, and included tennis and playing golf with an occasional tournament award. Always generous, she contributed to numerous charities including those supporting women, children, nature and Israel. She is survived by her sister, Gloria Ratner, of New York City; her daughter Jill Sharff, of Haverford, PA; and her son David Sharff, of Rockaway, NJ.
