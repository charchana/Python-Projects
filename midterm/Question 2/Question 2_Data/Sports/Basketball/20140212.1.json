February 10th, 2014. Age 65; of Valley Stream, New York, but Milwaukee, Wisconsin before that. Beloved and towering figure in the sports medicine community. It's hard to sum up a life in two words, but if you could, for Cathy, it would be: strong heart. Cathy was an influential practitioner of the Alexander Technique whose diverse array of students included members of the Metropolitan Opera, players for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team and important figures in contemporary jazz. Before receiving her multiple professional accolades in her field (including a Master's Degree in Kinesiology), Cathy was a dancer. She would often tell strangers, \"I was a dancer, you know,\" as if her graceful movements and radiant beauty weren't proof enough. For the last seven years of her life, Cathy was also admired for what she called \"dancing my way through cancer.\" Having received a 6-months-to-live diagnosis nearly a decade ago, Cathy fought valiantly and beautifully and inspired countless patients, nurses and doctors to keep dancing. She died on her birthday. Like Moses. Cathy is survived by her two loving children Lukas Kaiser and Marissa Kaiser, as well as an insurmountable number of extended family and friends, colleagues and students who will feel her loss forever. Please send condolences to 344 Mill Road, Valley Stream, NY 11581.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  KAISER, CATHY L."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T01:18:08Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"52fb462e38f0d812174eeafa","word_count":"217","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/02\/12\/sports\/ncaabasketball\/ap-bkc-ncaa-wellman.html","snippet":"The chairman of the Division I men's basketball committee said changes made last August to the way teams are bracketed in the NCAA tournament will result in a fairer March Madness....","lead_paragraph":"The chairman of the Division I men's basketball committee said changes made last August to the way teams are bracketed in the NCAA tournament will result in a fairer March Madness.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"NCAA Selection Committee Hopes for More Fairness","print_headline":"NCAA Selection Committee Hopes for More Fairness"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T17:48:49Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"College Basketball","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52fbfb0338f0d81766aee092","word_count":"602","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/02\/12\/sports\/ncaabasketball\/ap-bkc-t25-central-florida-memphis.html","snippet":"Joe Jackson scored 18 points and Shaq Goodwin added 14 as No. 20 Memphis used a late second half rally to defeat Central Florida 76-70 on Wednesday night....","lead_paragraph":"Joe Jackson scored 18 points and Shaq Goodwin added 14 as No. 20 Memphis used a late second half rally to defeat Central Florida 76-70 on Wednesday night.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Memphis Uses Second Half Rally to Beat UCF 76-70","print_headline":"Memphis Uses Second Half Rally to Beat UCF 76-70"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T23:22:02Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"College Basketball","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52fc48c338f0d81766aee1b7","word_count":"403","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9404E2D9143AF931A25751C0A9629D8B63","snippet":"ZUBAY--Geoffrey Louis.

Professor Geoffrey Louis Zubay, who pioneered early studies on gene expression after the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA and genetic code, died on February 5 in West Palm Beach, FL, where he and his wife resided since 2011. He was 82 years old. The cause of death was cardiac arrest. Born in Chicago November 15, 1931, Dr. Zubay had a very precocious youth and graduated from the University of Chicago with an A.B. in Philosophy at the age of seventeen. He received an M.A. in Physical Chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1952, and a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1957. He completed three years of post-doctoral study at Kings College of the University of London, and the Rockefeller Institute in New York. Dr. Zubay then established his own lab at the Biology Department of Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island in 1961. Three years later Dr. Zubay was recruited to Columbia University where he remained for 41 years. During his tenure at Columbia, Dr. Zubay's lab became renowned for the development of several cell-free systems for examining the expression of genes. This was during a time of great interest in gene expression following elucidation of the structure of DNA and genetic code. In addition to a long distinguished scientific research that included more than 160 publications, Dr. Zubay wrote a widely employed textbook in Biochemistry that survived four editions. He also wrote a Genetics textbook published in 1987. In his later career, his research interests shifted to the origins of life and prebiotic chemistry. This direction led to another text Origins of Life on the Earth and in the Cosmos, for which there were two editions published by Academic Press. In the aftermath of 9\/11, Dr. Zubay compiled, along with othercontributing authors Agents of Bioterrorism: Pathogens and their Weaponization published by Columbia University Press. Athletically gifted, Dr. Zubay enjoyed playing basketball with colleagues, swimming daily on the University campus, and relaxed playing poker with friends. After retirement, Dr. Zubay and his wife relocated to San Diego, CA where he served for three years as a visiting research scholar at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla. Dr. Zubay is survived by his wife of 47 years, Bongsoon, his son Geoffrey Pyong, Director of Neurosurgery Department at Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Hospital in Houston, TX, his daughter-in-law, Erin, and three grandchildren, Ryan, Abby, and Geoffrey Mitchell.","abstract":null,"print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  ZUBAY, GEOFFREY LOUIS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ZUBAY, GEOFFREY LOUIS"}],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53057e8a38f0d843b6dd8c70","word_count":"403","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/02\/12\/sports\/basketball\/ap-bkn-spurs-celtics.html","snippet":"Tim Duncan scored 23 of his 25 points in the second half, powering the injury-depleted San Antonio Spurs to a 104-92 win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night....","lead_paragraph":"Tim Duncan scored 23 of his 25 points in the second half, powering the injury-depleted San Antonio Spurs to a 104-92 win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Duncan Carries Spurs to 104-92 Win Over Celtics","print_headline":"Duncan Carries Spurs to 104-92 Win Over Celtics"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T21:58:52Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Pro Basketball","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52fc350938f0d81766aee162","word_count":"429","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/02\/12\/arts\/ap-us-paula-deen.html","snippet":"Paula Deen has found a key ingredient to bringing some sizzle back to her career &#8212; a cash infusion worth at least $75 million from a private investment firm....","lead_paragraph":"Paula Deen has found a key ingredient to bringing some sizzle back to her career &#8212; a cash infusion worth at least $75 million from a private investment firm.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paula Deen Cooks Up $75M Comeback Deal","print_headline":"Paula Deen Cooks Up $75M Comeback Deal"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-02-12T14:12:08Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52fbc82038f0d81766aedfb2","word_count":"379","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2014\/02\/12\/sports\/basketball\/12reuters-olympics-icehockey-miracle-rivalries-factbox.html","snippet":"The United States and Russia, including their Soviet days, have one of the longest and most competitive rivalries in international sport, often fuelled by the political differences.
