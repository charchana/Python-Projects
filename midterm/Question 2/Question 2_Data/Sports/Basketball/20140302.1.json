ROSS -->ROSS--Jesse Simmons, died unexpectedly at his home on January 11, 2014. He was thirty-six years old. A lifelong New Yorker, Jesse was born in Chelsea, raised in Tribeca, and happily returned to the city after graduating from Skidmore College with a degree in business. He centered his professional life around his love of fashion and hip-hop design. We see his unique tee shirts worn all around the city. Jesse was a natural athlete, an expert in tennis, skiing and basketball. As an adult, he developed a passion for mixed martial arts and was preparing to become an instructor in the field. Jesse was handsome and sweet, he had an amazing smile, warmth, natural intelligence and remarkable charm. Jesse's life dramatically changed in 2007 with the birth of his son. Damien, his \"mini-me\" and \"little ninja\" instantly became the center of his world and remained the focus until the day Jesse died. Jesse is survived by his adored son Damien Ross; his parents Dr. Bonnie Simmons and Roger Ross; his sister Julie Ross; step-father Bart Wenrich; and grandparents Dorothy Simmons and Itta and Donald Ross. He will also be missed by his aunts, Laurie and Susan Simmons, and uncles Carroll and Jeff; and by his cousins Jenna, Lena, and Grace.
