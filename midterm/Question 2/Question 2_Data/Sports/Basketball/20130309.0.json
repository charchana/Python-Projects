Resident of Jupiter, FL, died peacefully at home in Greenwich, CT after a courageous year and a half long battle against an aggressive brain tumor. He is survived by his beloved wife, E. Galey Clarke, his children Marian Weaver Ide of Natick, MA, S. Davis Weaver of Cape Cod, MA, Timothy Weaver of Bolton, MA, Jen Weaver Trisk of Greenwich, CT, his brother William Bigler Weaver III of Colts Neck, NJ, his sister Alita Weaver Reed of Hobe Sound, FL and eight grandchildren. Samuel D. Weaver was the second child of William Bigler Weaver Jr. of Charlestown, WV and Alita Davis Weaver of St. Louis, MO. He was predeceased by his younger brother E. Whitaker Weaver of Greenwich, CT. Sam was an alumnus of Greenwich Country Day School, Middlesex School in Concord, MA and Williams College, Class 1961. He maintained many loyal friendships with classmates throughout his life. He was a fierce competitor and will be remembered for his athletic achievements in basketball and baseball at both Middlesex and Williams. Following a successful career in banking at the Wall Street firm of Morgan Guarantee, he became a private investor. He was the \"go to\" person for friends, family and associates with questions about finance. Among the many committees that Sam served on over the years, the one closest to his heart was the Grindstone Association of Winter Harbor, ME. He served as Chairman of the Golf Committee for twenty years and was instrumental in improving one of the oldest golf courses in the United States. Sam was caring and reliable; a man without pretense. Whether at the Round Hill Club, the Winter Harbor Yacht Club, or Admiral's Cove, you could count on Sam for a good story. He was always ready to laugh, tease or pull a prank, but try as he might, he couldn't prevent the twinkle in his eye or the twitching at the end of his nose from giving away his joking. Sam will be buried alongside his mother, father and brother at the Putnam Cemetery. Services are private.","abstract":null,"print_page":"08","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  WEAVER, SAMUEL DAVIS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WEAVER, SAMUEL DAVIS"}],"pub_date":"2013-03-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"514711e9fdc5926e7700040a","word_count":"352","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
