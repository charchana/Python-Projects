On January 10, 2014 Cooper Dean Stock, beloved son of Dana Lerner and Dr. Richard Stock, was tragically killed in a vehicular accident near his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was just nine years old. Cooper was a spirited third grader who attended the Calhoun School. Cooper had a larger than life personality and will be massively missed by everyone who knew him. Cooper loved to play basketball and avidly followed the Knicks. Cooper was a statistic machine when it came to the Knicks. Everyone marveled at what he knew. He was also a fan of the New York Yankees and classic rock 'n' roll. Cooper was the life of the party even when there wasn't a party. He was light, he was reflective, he was beauty in motion, he was charismatic, he has been described as an old soul and wise beyond his years. In addition to his parents he is survived by: sister Gianna, a more loving older sister never existed; grandmother Ronnie Lerner of University Heights, OH; grandmother Nadine Stock of NYC; uncle Barron, aunt Cathy and cousins Ben and Nina Lerner of Hastings-on-Hudson; uncle Matt and aunt Irina and cousins Dennis, Willy and Maxim Stock of NYC; uncle Wayne, aunt Melina and cousin Robert Stock of New Jersey. Cooper was lovingly looked after by Judy Campbell who was like a second mother to him. Cooper was predeceased by both of his grandfathers: Dr. Phillip Lerner and Robert Stock. Cooper will live in our hearts forever. We will never understand why we had to say goodbye so soon. Services will be held on Monday, January 13th at 11:45 at Riverside Memorial Chapel on 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. In lieu of flowers, kindly send donations in Cooper's memory to Temple Beth Shalom, 740 North Broadway, Hastings-on-Hudson, NY 10706. The family will decide which charities to send the donations to at a later date.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  STOCK, COOPER DEAN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"STOCK, COOPER DEAN"}],"pub_date":"2014-01-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"52ddf14738f0d808a7480eb7","word_count":"322","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/ncaabasketball\/ap-bkw-t25-uconn-baylor.html","snippet":"Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma was as anxious as anyone to see how his top-ranked Huskies would handle a close game....","lead_paragraph":"Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma was as anxious as anyone to see how his top-ranked Huskies would handle a close game.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"No. 1 UConn Women End Baylor Home Streak, 66-55","print_headline":"No. 1 UConn Women End Baylor Home Streak, 66-55"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-01-13T21:05:19Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"College Basketball","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52d49bca38f0d82fe60bbfbe","word_count":"776","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/01\/13\/us\/ap-us-schools-closed-water-dispute.html","snippet":"A dispute over the water bill between a one-stoplight South Texas town and its school district has shuttered the schools and left students and parents scrambling....","lead_paragraph":"A dispute over the water bill between a one-stoplight South Texas town and its school district has shuttered the schools and left students and parents scrambling.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Water Dispute Closes South Texas School District","print_headline":"Water Dispute Closes South Texas School District"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-01-13T15:02:54Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52d4477a38f0d82fe60bbe92","word_count":"819","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/ap-ap-sportlight.html","snippet":"Jan. 14...","lead_paragraph":"Jan. 14","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"AP Sportlight","print_headline":"AP Sportlight"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-01-13T08:26:57Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52d3e9da38f0d825af31582e","word_count":"482","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/hockey\/q-and-a-with-john-kerry.html","snippet":"Secretary of State John Kerry described his life in hockey, including the way he followed Yale&#8217;s run to a national championship....","lead_paragraph":"Secretary of State John Kerry described his life in hockey, including the way he followed Yale&#8217;s run to a national championship.","abstract":null,"print_page":"","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/13kerryqanda1\/13kerryqanda1-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/13kerryqanda1\/13kerryqanda1-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/13kerryqanda1\/13kerryqanda1-articleLarge.jpg","height":780,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/13kerryqanda1\/13kerryqanda1-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"780"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/13kerryqanda1\/13kerryqanda1-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2014\/01\/13\/sports\/13kerryqanda1\/13kerryqanda1-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Q. and A.&nbsp;With John Kerry","print_headline":"Q. and A.
