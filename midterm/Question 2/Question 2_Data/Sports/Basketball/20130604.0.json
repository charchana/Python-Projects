McClintock and Aileen McHugh McClintock on August 20, 1957 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mike married Cynthia Ann Crowley on June 21, 1986 on Nantucket Island. Together they have three wonderful children: Christina Carey McClintock, Clare Melissa McClintock, and William Crowley McClintock, all of whom survive him. Mike is also survived by his four sisters and one brother: Jessie McClintock Kelly, Brooklyn, NY; Catharine R. McClintock, Edina, MN; George D McClintock, Purchase NY, Jane M Wyatt, Edina MN, Anne D McClintock, Medford MA. He was also beloved by his sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law: John Meeker, Binita Mehta, Wiz Wyatt, Catherine Poole, Melissa and Penry Price, Peter and Gretchen Crowley, and his parents-in-law Joan and Paul Crowley, and numerous nieces and nephews. Mike was a 1976 graduate of the Blake School in Hopkins, Minnesota. He graduated from Dartmouth College with a B.A. in 1980, and from Harvard Business School with an M.B.A. in 1986. Since 2011, Mike has been a Senior Managing Director at Macquarie Capital, in the Financial Institutions Group. Previously he held senior positions at FBR Capital Markets, CIBC Capital Markets, Merrill Lynch, and JP Morgan. Mike was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Merchants Bank of Rugby, North Dakota, a family business established by his great-grandfather in 1898. Mike believed strongly in the importance of education and was very active as an alumnus of Dartmouth College. Always a fan of the Big Green, Mike worked tirelessly to encourage support for Dartmouth, and was inducted into the Stephen F. Mandel '52 Society in recognition of his extraordinary service to the College. He was also a member of the Board of Directors Catholic Youth Organization, Archdiocese of New York, a program he wanted to support after years of watching his children's CYO basketball games. He is a past member of the Board of Governors of the Apawamis Club of Rye. Mike was an Eagle Scout, Troop 33 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He put his scouting skills to use while at Dartmouth. For his senior honors thesis on the Canadian fur trade he retraced the major trade route from Saskatchewan to Lake Superior by canoe over three months. Mike loved sports. He was an avid skier, biker and golfer. He recently completed his first Olympic length triathlon and was so proud to finish after months of training. He also loved watching sports and cheering on Minnesota teams, but he took the most pleasure in watching his kids' sports and cheering loudly from the sidelines. Mike will be remembered for his smile and the generous way he celebrated the accomplishments of others. He always had handwritten notes tucked into pockets, and was frequently working on the speeches he gave for graduations, confirmations, weddings, birthdays and any special event for someone he loved. A sincere and loyal friend, Mike was always available to give good advice, offer a hug, or just listen and comfort. Mike was a devoted husband, and a wonderful father to his three children. His children knew that even though he worked hard, he would always be there at games, or at home to help with homework. He had a Teddy Roosevelt quote for every situation. Most importantly, he modeled a life of compassion for all. Mike was in love with his wife Cynthia, and through this love his children saw how trust and love build a strong family and a meaningful life. Visiting Hours Wednesday 2-4 and 7-9pm at Fox Funeral Home in Larchmont. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Thursday 10am at St. Augustine Church in Larchmont. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to Dartmouth College.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  MCCLINTOCK, MICHAEL ROBERT"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MCCLINTOCK, MICHAEL ROBERT"}],"pub_date":"2013-06-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"51b88ef97e0d9c0839d274c4","word_count":"623","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/Link.asp?I=LS000165143928","snippet":"McCLINTOCK--Michael Robert, age 55, of Larchmont, New York, died on June 2, 2013.

For his senior honors thesis on the Canadian fur trade he retraced the major trade route from Saskatchewan to Lake Superior by canoe over three months. Mike loved sports. He was an avid skier, biker and golfer. He recently completed his first Olympic length triathlon and was so proud to finish after months of training. He also loved watching sports and cheering on Minnesota teams, but he took the most pleasure in watching his kids' sports and cheering loudly from the sidelines. Mike will be remembered for his smile and the generous way he celebrated the accomplishments of others. He always had handwritten notes tucked into pockets, and was frequently working on the speeches he gave for graduations, confirmations, weddings, birthdays and any special event for someone he loved. A sincere and loyal friend, Mike was always available to give good advice, offer a hug, or just listen and comfort. Mike was a devoted husband, and a wonderful father to his three children. His children knew that even though he worked hard, he would always be there at games, or at home to help with homework. He had a Teddy Roosevelt quote for every situation. Most importantly, he modeled a life of compassion for all. Mike was in love with his wife Cynthia, and through this love his children saw how trust and love build a strong family and a meaningful life.
