A service will be held at the Jewish Memorial Chapel, 841 Allwood Road, Clifton, at 11:00am on Sunday, May 26, 2013. Born and raised in Passaic, Bob, known to many of his friends as \"Tippy\" or \"Toppy\", was a spectacular athlete, a \"natural\" talent in all sports, particularly tennis and golf. He was a hurdler and basketball player, but best known for his speed and prowess as a football player for Passaic High School and the University of Pennsylvania, where he was one of the \"Munger\" men. He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and then attended Penn on the GI Bill, graduating from the Wharton School. He was a member of ZBT. Bob and his wife of 62 years, Phyllis, met at Penn. They married and moved to New Jersey, where he started his own insurance business. He was an independent agent, serving personal and business clients throughout Northern New Jersey for more than 40 years, until he retired. In a life dedicated to serving and helping other people, he was, among other things, a President of the Board of Trustees of the Passaic Beth Israel Hospital, a President of the American Friends of Tel Aviv University, a Chair of the Passaic-Clifton UJA, a member of the Clifton Board of Education, a President of the PTA of the Montclair College High School and an active supporter of countless other charities and causes. He had an exceptional joy and passion for life, and was an unwavering and unconditional friend. Bob's beloved parents, Wolf (\"Ben\") and Lillian (\"Libby\") Topchik, brother Abraham (\"Abe\") and sister Sylvia (\"Simi\") Levine predeceased him. In addition to his wife, Phyllis, and his children Meryl and husband Richard Ringle, David, Alan and wife Yazz, and John Topchik, Bob is survived by five wonderful grandchildren, Eric, Samantha, Hugh, Caroline and Ethan. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his name to American Friends of Tel Aviv University, 39 Broadway, Suite 1510, NY 10006 to the attention of Ari Wein, noting that the donation is to be designated to the Phyllis and Robert Topchik Scholarship Fund for Post Graduate Studies. Donations may also be made to Israel Congregation of Manchester Vermont, 6025 Main Street, Manchester Center, Vermont 05255, or Hospice by the Sea, Boca Raton, FL.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  TOPCHIK, ROBERT J."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2013-05-25T02:28:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5214683a38f0d8740ac9a3de","word_count":"411","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/05\/25\/sports\/soccer\/learning-on-the-job-gus-johnson-prepares-for-broadcast-of-soccer-final.html","snippet":"Learning game strategies and player pronunciations, all while dealing with a rabid fan base, posed challenges for Gus Johnson in his first year as a soccer broadcaster for Fox....","lead_paragraph":"Learning game strategies and player pronunciations, all while dealing with a rabid fan base, posed challenges for Gus Johnson in his first year as a soccer broadcaster for Fox.","abstract":"Gus Johnson, former basketball star and football announcer, is preparing to do the play-by-play for soccer's Champions League final, biggest assignment in what he calls his freshman year as a soccer broadcaster for Fox.","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/sports\/25gus1\/25gus1-thumbWide-v2.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/sports\/25gus1\/25gus1-thumbWide-v2.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/sports\/25gus1\/25gus1-articleLarge-v2.jpg","height":375,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/sports\/25gus1\/25gus1-articleLarge-v2.jpg","xlargeheight":"375"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/sports\/25gus1\/25gus1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/sports\/25gus1\/25gus1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Learning on the Job, Gus Johnson Prepares for Broadcast of Soccer Final","main":"Gus Johnson\u2019s Crash Course","print_headline":"Gus Johnson\u2019s Crash Course"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Johnson, Gus","name":"persons"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"Y","value":"Soccer","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Television","name":"subject"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"Y","value":"Fox Sports","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","value":"UEFA Champions League (Soccer)","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2013-05-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Soccer","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sam","rank":1,"lastname":"BORDEN"}],"original":"By SAM BORDEN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"51a22b3b40e9ec0a56fe2d4d","word_count":"1800","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/05\/25\/us\/alton-t-lemon-civil-rights-activist-dies-at-84.html","snippet":"Mr. Lemon was a civil rights activist whose objection to a 1968 Pennsylvania law gave rise to a watershed 1971 Supreme Court decision....","lead_paragraph":"Mr. Lemon was a civil rights activist whose objection to a 1968 Pennsylvania law gave rise to a watershed 1971 Supreme Court decision.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/us\/25lemon-obit\/25lemon-obit-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/us\/25lemon-obit\/25lemon-obit-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/us\/25lemon-obit\/25lemon-obit-articleLarge.jpg","height":858,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/us\/25lemon-obit\/25lemon-obit-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"858"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/us\/25lemon-obit\/25lemon-obit-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2013\/05\/25\/us\/25lemon-obit\/25lemon-obit-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Alton T.
