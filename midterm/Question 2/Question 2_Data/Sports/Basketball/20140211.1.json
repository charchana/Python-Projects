Howard was born in Albany, NY, on January 24, 1928, the fourth child of Morris and Molly Swartz. He married his beloved Goldie Brenner on September 3, 1950, and lived in the Albany area where Howard worked for the New York State Department of Labor until 1964, when he and his family moved to Rockland County, NY, and settled in New City, NY in 1965. In 1972, he formed and became president of Industrial UI Services, an unemployment insurance cost control firm, where he served until 1989, when he and Goldie retired and moved to Longboat Key, FL. Howard was an active bicycle rider often riding up to 40 miles a day and going on several major bicycle trips in the United States and in Europe. After he lost most of his sight, he and Goldie would ride a tandem bike for miles with Goldie in front. He loved baseball and basketball, and would spend hours listening to games. He especially loved listening to Vin Scully announce Dodger games, staying up late into the night just to hear him. Most of all he loved spending time with his family, including attending annual family reunions. He was also extremely proud of establishing with Goldie the Goldie Brenner Swartz and Howard Swartz Scholarship Fund at SUNY Albany which provides scholarship assistance to disabled students, primarily to students with vision impairments. The scholarship has assisted many students who would otherwise have been unable to complete their undergraduate studies. The scholarship has provided a dozen students in the last six years the opportunity to complete their undergraduate studies. Howard was predeceased in 2010 by his wife Goldie, who he loved dearly and talked about every day. He is survived by his son Mark and wife Iris of New City, NY, son Barry and wife Karen of Clarence, NY, grandsons Michael Swartz, Adam Swartz (and wife Melissa) and Jonathan Campbell (and wife Jenna), and many cousins, nieces, nephews and friends. He was predeceased by his sisters Sylvia and Anna, and by his brother Billy. Following a funeral service in Albany, NY, a period of mourning will be held at the home of Mark and Iris Swartz, 35 Ruth Drive, New City, NY. In lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the Swartz Scholarship Fund by making checks payable to The University at Albany Foundation, UAB 226, 1400 Washington Ave., Albany, NY 12222, and indicating Swartz Scholarship in the memo portion of the check.
