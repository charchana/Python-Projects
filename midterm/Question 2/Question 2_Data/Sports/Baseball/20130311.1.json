When at last the applause died down, Graeme McDowell stood over a 7-footer for birdie that suddenly looked twice as long. He rolled it in to remain three strokes behind Woods, and as he walked off the green, he made eye contact with a friend and said, \u201cWe\u2019re not playing for second place here.\u201d\n \nMcDowell\u2019s mettle was moving, albeit misplaced. McDowell, who opened with a birdie, could be forgiven for believing that pluck could pull him through in a final-round duel against Woods. At the 2010 World Challenge, McDowell came from four strokes back, the same deficit he faced at Sunday\u2019s start, to tie Woods, whom he then dispatched in a playoff.","abstract":"Tiger Woods wins his 76th PGA Tour title at Cadillac Championship, his first World Golf Championships event since 2009.
