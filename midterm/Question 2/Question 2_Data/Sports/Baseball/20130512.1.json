Creator Of Video Arcades. Fred Carcone came to this country from Italy in 1927, alone at seven years old from Italy to join his two sisters and father in Queens, New York. He was intelligent strong, willful, and adventurous. He died Saturday April 21, 2013 peacefully at 93. His education was minimal, only completing the sixth grade, at which time he worked with his father in the grocery business helping to support the family which was his enduring emotional support. He learned early that this was to him the most important part of his being because he had a nurturing way and enjoyed giving to others, especially family which was the most endearing to him. This set the path for all of his life. The natural creative genius, God given, empowered him to find new and unusual approaches to business. Both his brother- in-law, John Christofpher and Ale Simon, admiring his character, helped him to find his niche on Broadway. His ethics and focus turned around three failing businesses of which he was involved. He become the proprietor of two arcades on Broadway, New York, and one arcade of which he owned the building, in Newark, New Jersey. His achievements in life were profound and amazing. He worked in an area that allowed him to express his originality for five decades and always remembered his humble beginnings saying, \"I can only wear one pair of pants, a shirt and a pair of shoes, no matter how much money I have\". Compassion for friends and family, and helping them achieve their dreams was foremost on his mind. He wanted others to be given opportunities to achieve their dreams. Baseball and The New York Yankees was his second passion. His endearing, quite natured, soft-spoken manner and magnanimous smile will be sorely missed. He has joined his Shepherd and is now where he belongs, in heaven.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid
