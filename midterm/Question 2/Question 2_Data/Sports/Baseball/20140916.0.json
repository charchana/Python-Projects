He went to NYU School of the Arts where he formed many lifelong friendships. He achieved acclaim as an interpreter of Sam Shepard's works, in particular his 1978 Club 57 production of Geography of a Horse Dreamer. David loved baseball, the Mets and the East River Rats softball team. David celebrated life; presiding for 26 years over a monthly dinner at various Indian restaurants in the East Village, where his braying laughter would bring pedestrians in from the street just to have a look, and hosting numerous celebrations of the summer solstice on his roof top. Founder of Bootleg Theater, David wrote and directed Ban Republican Marriage, Dialog of Insects, The Devil and Walter Cronkite, and Moon Saloon, A Play in 9 Innings. His final play, Not Dead Yet, has ironically not yet been produced. He is survived by his family of friends in New York, his sisters Elizabeth and Mary, his nephews Arin and Matthew, and niece Alaina.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  WATKINS, DAVID"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WATKINS, DAVID"}],"pub_date":"2014-09-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"542234bd38f0d83c6e5b7cb7","word_count":"166","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
