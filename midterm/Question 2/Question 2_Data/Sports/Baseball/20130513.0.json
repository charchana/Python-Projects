But the atmosphere suggested a more restrained version of the fervor exhibited by Beliebers. \n \n Mr. Tveit (pronounced tuh-VATE), who starred on Broadway as Gabe in \u201cNext to Normal\u201d and as Frank Abagnale Jr. in \u201cCatch Me if You Can\u201d and on film as Enjolras in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d has the dreamy good looks of a high school sports hero who elicits collective sighs of longing. The good news for Broadway and cabaret is that his charisma coincides with talent, discriminating taste in material and a modesty that doesn\u2019t seem faked. His band \u2014 Bryan Perri on piano, Eric Davis on winds, Michael Blanco on bass, and Damien Bassman on drums \u2014 matched him in poise and precision.","abstract":"Stephen Holden reviews performance by singer Aaron Tveit at 54 Below.
