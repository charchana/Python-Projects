The son of Gail and Stanley Posnack of New City, NY, he was born on New Year's Eve 1966 in New York. He grew up in Airmont, NY with his two sisters, Beth Hecht and Jennifer DeMarchi. He attended Suffern High School, where he captained the football, wrestling and baseball teams. Adam earned a B.A. from Princeton University in 1989 and was a member of the Varsity Football team. He had a highly distinguished, 25-year career in finance at UBS, Deutche Bank, Jefferies, and most recently, FBR & Co., where he was a Managing Director and Head of Convertible Bond Sales. Known for his larger-than-life personality, intense drive, and wonderful sense of humor, he was a loving son, husband, father, and loyal friend. He performed tireless charity work as a Board Member on behalf of the Familial Dysautonomia Foundation. His greatest joys in life came from his wife, Robin Fiddle Posnack, and their four children, Cody, Jack, Hunter and Charlotte. He often remarked being a father was the greatest gift he'd ever received. In addition to his wife and children, he is survived by his parents, sisters, sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law, nieces and nephews. Funeral services will be held on Sunday, August 3, at 10:30am at Temple Beth El, 415 Viola Road, Spring Valley, NY.
