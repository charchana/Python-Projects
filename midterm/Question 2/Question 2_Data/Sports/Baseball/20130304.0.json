Last week, he had a    close encounter with an alligator    on a golf course, and on Saturday,    he was involved in a car accident.    In both instances, he came away    unscathed.    Suzuki\u2019s sport utility vehicle    and another car collided at an intersection    near the Yankees\u2019    spring training complex. Suzuki,    who was unhurt, said both cars    were totaled and the air bags in    his S.U.V. deployed.    \u201cI guess you can say that    you\u2019re going to have to do a lot    worse to have me get hurt,\u201d he    said through his interpreter.    Suzuki worked out Sunday and    planned to see the team physician    for precautionary reasons, but he    said he felt nothing.    He said it was his first accident    as a driver, but he was hit by a car    when riding his bike while in high    school in Japan. He said that incident    had made him extra aware    of his surroundings when driving,    and also as a passenger.    \u201cI\u2019m probably the worst backseat    driver,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I    see everything and I tell the driver,    \u2018Be careful,\u2019 a lot.\u201d","abstract":"New York Yankees outfielder Ichiro Suzuki's is uninjured in traffic accident near team's spring training facility in Florida.
