He is survived by his parents, Byron and Camille, and sister, Gabrielle. Born March 10, 1991, he was a 2010 graduate of The Hill School, where he was President of the School, winner of the Award for Excellence in Leadership, and Captain of the Varsity Soccer and Baseball teams. He graduated from Amherst College in 2014, where he majored in religion and helped lead the Amherst baseball team to four record-setting seasons. Alexander's life was defined by emotion. He was passionate about sports, fought for fairness and railed against injustice, cherished his many friends and teammates, and, most of all, was lovingly devoted to his father, mother and sister. A memorial service celebrating his life will be held at noon on Saturday, December 6, at The River Club, 447 East 52nd Street, NY, NY 10022. In his memory, contributions to the Alexander B. Hero Scholarship Fund at The Hill School, 717 East High Street, Pottstown, PA 19464, would be welcome. 1\/3","abstract":null,"print_page":"08","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  HERO, ALEXANDER BYRON"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"HERO, ALEXANDER BYRON"}],"pub_date":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5486748238f0d8164e21e10b","word_count":"168","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/12\/01\/sports\/football\/ap-fbn-senate-domestic-violence.html","snippet":"A day before a Senate hearing on domestic violence he will not attend, the head of the NFL Players Association said the union is establishing an eight-member commission to advise it on the issue....","lead_paragraph":"A day before a Senate hearing on domestic violence he will not attend, the head of the NFL Players Association said the union is establishing an eight-member commission to advise it on the issue.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"NFLPA Setting Up Commission on Domestic Violence","print_headline":"NFLPA Setting Up Commission on Domestic Violence"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-12-01T18:53:28Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Pro Football","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"547cffe138f0d822abda1a01","word_count":"415","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2014\/12\/01\/sports\/baseball\/01reuters-olympics-squash.html","snippet":"Former International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound is confident the IOC will drop regulations limiting the number of sports on the Games program and says squash should be brought into the Olympic fold....","lead_paragraph":"Former International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound is confident the IOC will drop regulations limiting the number of sports on the Games program and says squash should be brought into the Olympic fold.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Former IOC Vice President Pound Backs Squash Inclusion","print_headline":"Former IOC Vice President Pound Backs Squash Inclusion"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-12-01T22:50:39Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Baseball","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"547d376738f0d822abda1ee5","word_count":"342","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/12\/01\/us\/ap-us-police-chiefs-mailbox.html","snippet":"The theft of the Honolulu police chief's mailbox not only brought allegations of undue influence after a crack police squad made an arrest, but also exposed a messy family financial dispute....","lead_paragraph":"The theft of the Honolulu police chief's mailbox not only brought allegations of undue influence after a crack police squad made an arrest, but also exposed a messy family financial dispute.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Police Chief's Stolen Mailbox Exposes Family Feud","print_headline":"Police Chief's Stolen Mailbox Exposes Family Feud"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-12-01T20:01:41Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"None","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"547d100a38f0d822abda1b75","word_count":"596","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
