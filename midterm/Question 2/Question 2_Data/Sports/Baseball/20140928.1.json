He was 84. Dick was born to a Columbia Presbyterian nurse and AT & T engineer and lived on a farm in Green Village, NJ during his early youth during the Depression. Later the family moved to Bergenfield, NJ where Dick was a standout athlete in high school. At Rutgers University, from which he graduated and received his Masters in Education, Dick lettered in varsity soccer and also played baseball. Known as \"Oke,\" he was revered at Rutgers Preparatory School where he started as Athletic Director in 1952, the same year he married. He then embarked on a 45 year career at RPS that would see him serve that entire time as Athletic Director and coach baseball (four State titles), soccer, cross country, swimming, and lacrosse. Oke built the RPS athletic program from three teams to the over 40 it boasts today, with a commitment to improving athletic offerings for girls. His greatest coaching achievements, however, came on the basketball court where he was head coach of Boys' Basketball for 45 years, coaching over 1,000 games with 700 wins, and winning nine New Jersey Prep Conference titles, eight State Prep tournaments and four Somerset County crowns. At the time of his retirement in 1997, he held the New Jersey record for most career wins in high school boys' basketball and remains in the top ten today. Oke was inducted into many associations' Halls of Fame, including the New Jersey Scholastic Coaches Association, the New Jersey Sportswriters Association and that of Rutgers Prep. After his retirement, Oke and Pegeen, his wife of 57 years, assumed the roles of Rutgers Prep ambassadors, re-uniting with his former students and players and sharing the milestones of RPS graduates at their homes all over the country. Pegeen pre-deceased him in 2009. The Rutgers Prep gymnasium was re-named the Richard S. O'Connell Athletic Center. The RPS dining facility was recently constructed and named the Pegeen O'Connell Dining Commons. Oke leaves behind son Kevin O'Connell, his wife Twila, and granddaughter Shannon; son Rory O'Connell, his wife Moira, and grandsons Adrian and Benjamin; son John O'Connell, his wife Stacey and grandson Tristan; and daughter Tara Klipstein, her husband David and grandsons Ryan, Reaves, and Christian. A memorial service at Rutgers Prep is planned for October 19 at 11:30am. For more information, please visit www.rutgersprep.org. In lieu of flowers or gifts, Oke asked that donations be made to Rutgers Preparatory School.","abstract":null,"print_page":"30","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  O'CONNELL, RICHARD STRONG"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"O'CONNELL, RICHARD STRONG"}],"pub_date":"2014-09-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5432075838f0d85b58978e8c","word_count":"412","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/Link.asp?I=LS000172608098","snippet":"O'CONNELL--Richard Strong, of Branchburg, New Jersey, died Wednesday, September 24.
