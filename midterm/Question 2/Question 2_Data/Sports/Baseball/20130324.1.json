Miuccia Prada presented a collection of what seemed to be team uniforms for the future. Valentino, Bottega Veneta and Raf Simons showed the majority (if not all) of their looks with sneakers instead of proper oxfords. Some designers were even more specific with their sporty adaptions \u2014 as in the case of the young British designer Lou Dalton, who created this high-fashion take on a baseball shirt ($399; openingceremony.us ).\n \nTo be clear, these are not clothes meant for wearing on the field or court.
