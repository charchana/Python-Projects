Malfetti, a teacher for 43 years at Columbia College and Teachers College, Columbia University, died a year ago at his home in Carefree, AZ., at 92. The pioneer in sex education and traffic safety research was a born leader and teacher, whose students flourished because he made them feel valued. Remembered as a man who genuinely liked people of all kinds, Professor Malfetti was beloved for his generosity, fairness, optimism and sense of humor. \"Reproduction, Sex and Preparation for Marriage,\" which he co-authored in 1964, was a groundbreaking sex-education text published in at least five countries. In his 1957 \"Electronic Controls and Traffic Safety,\" he envisioned self-driving cars. Adaptations of his 1970 \"DWI Phoenix\" program are still in use globally. Professor Malfetti was born in 1920 in College Point, NY, to Vincent and Annie Burns Malfetti. He grew up in New York City, where in his youth he was a Bronx Home News paperboy, baseball park ice cream hawker, bouncer, maitre'd, lifeguard and Fuller Brush man, among numerous other jobs. In WWII, he was Navy officer in the European and Asian theaters. He went to college on the GI Bill, earned his doctorate, taught human sexuality and transportation safety and served on committees of the Transportation Research Board, National Research Council and National Academy of Sciences. The AAA Foundation, government and numerous corporations funded his research and publications at Columbia, where he was Assistant to the Dean of Columbia College, Associate Director of the Bicentennial of Columbia University and Associate Director of the American Assembly, a body of prominent thinkers founded by President Eisenhower to address national problems. Professor Malfetti was a widely admired educator, speaker, administrator and lover of art and literature, who in his 90s, recited Shakespeare sonnets and Housman poems by heart -a storyteller's storyteller who enlightened and entertained generations of students, his family and all those fortunate enough to have known him. He is deeply missed.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  MALFETTI, JAMES "},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-11-15T19:14:07Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"546875a738f0d81e5cd0d909","word_count":"327","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/11\/15\/sports\/baseball\/ap-bbo-japan-mlb-all-stars.html","snippet":"Japan beat the Major League Baseball All-Stars, 4-0, on Saturday in a game in which Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano broke his toe....","lead_paragraph":"Japan beat the Major League Baseball All-Stars, 4-0, on Saturday in a game in which Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano broke his toe.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"All-Stars Are No-Hit;
