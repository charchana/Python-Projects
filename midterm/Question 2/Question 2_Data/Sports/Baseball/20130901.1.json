During the 1970s, on the nightly news in New York City, an elderly African-American grandmother spoke through tears about her lack of money to pay her bills, such as rent, heating and other apartment fees. If she could not pay her bills, then she would probably die on the streets with her personal effects because her distant family did not have enough money to help her. A couple of hours later a mysterious venture capitalist drove up to the grandmother's small apartment in Harlem and handed her a check. He did this anonymously. This anonymous charitable donor had the name of Steve Flaks. He was a venture capitalist, family man, arts patron, world traveler, philanthropist, and cinema producer. He carved out his own American Dream, while always holding on to his integrity. Stephen Robert Flaks, Venture Capitalist and Renaissance man, age 72, resident of Scottsdale, AZ, died peacefully on August 30th at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. Steve, one of three children, was born in New York City, on January 1, 1941. He grew up in the shadows of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. But like his dad Jack before him, he was a New York Giants baseball team supporter when they still played at the Polo Grounds. Steve Flaks was an outstanding student, graduating with a B.A. from CCNY Baruch College in 1961. Harvard offered him a scholarship to its Business School, but Steve decided to work for Dreyfus Investments. He then began his ascent on Wall Street, even setting up his own successful brokerage firm. He later managed a successful private biotech hedge fund and fulfilled his film production aspirations, producing two films. While earning profits on his stock holdings, his favorite beneficiaries represented educational access, women's rights, animal rights and the environment. He especially supported arts organizations and fine arts in the Scottsdale region. His activities did not however end with philanthropy. Always fascinated by history and culture, Steve and his wife Beverly visited many of the world's continents. They toured on African safaris, trekked through China and India, and travelled by boat through the Amazon in Brazil. He was also a passionate New York Giants football fan, attending two of their recent Super Bowls. Most importantly, Steve Flaks was a dedicated family man. He was very happily married to his wife Beverly for 46 years. They birthed two sons, James and David, and they have two beloved dogs, Luni and Luna. Two sisters, Betty and Vicki, and daughter-in-law Jen, married to David, survive him.
