He went to NYU School of the Arts where he formed many lifelong friendships. He achieved acclaim as an interpreter of Sam Shepard's works, in particular his 1978 Club 57 production of Geography of a Horse Dreamer. David loved baseball, the Mets and the East River Rats softball team. David celebrated life; presiding for 26 years over a monthly dinner at various Indian restaurants in the East Village, where his braying laughter would bring pedestrians in from the street just to have a look, and hosting numerous celebrations of the summer solstice on his roof top. Founder of Bootleg Theater, David wrote and directed Ban Republican Marriage, Dialog of Insects, The Devil and Walter Cronkite, and Moon Saloon, A Play in 9 Innings. His final play, Not Dead Yet, has ironically not yet been produced. He is survived by his family of friends in New York, his sisters Elizabeth and Mary, his nephews Arin and Matthew, and niece Alaina.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  WATKINS, DAVID "},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-09-16T02:18:06Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5417fc1638f0d851fd3a8bef","word_count":"166","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2014\/09\/16\/sports\/soccer\/16reuters-soccer-australia-tournament.html","snippet":"Three leading European soccer teams will play a pre-season tournament in Australia next year to tap into growing interest in the sport there, one of the event's promoters said on Tuesday....","lead_paragraph":"Three leading European soccer teams will play a pre-season tournament in Australia next year to tap into growing interest in the sport there, one of the event's promoters said on Tuesday.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Three European Teams Targeted for Australian Tournament","print_headline":"Three European Teams Targeted for Australian Tournament"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-09-16T06:35:07Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Soccer","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"541812af38f0d851fd3a8e03","word_count":"246","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/09\/16\/sports\/golf\/ap-glf-us-senior-amateur.html","snippet":"Rick Cloninger advanced to the U.S. Senior Amateur quarterfinals Tuesday, beating qualifying medalist Alan Fadel and David Szewczul at Big Canyon....","lead_paragraph":"Rick Cloninger advanced to the U.S. Senior Amateur quarterfinals Tuesday, beating qualifying medalist Alan Fadel and David Szewczul at Big Canyon.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Cloninger Reaches US Senior Amateur Quarterfinals","print_headline":"Cloninger Reaches US Senior Amateur Quarterfinals"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-09-16T21:43:17Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Golf","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5418e7c938f0d86afc9a0b8c","word_count":"349","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/09\/16\/sports\/baseball\/ap-bba-blue-jays-orioles.html","snippet":"Champagne was spraying all around him, and Dan Duquette couldn't help but laugh at the mayhem he helped create....","lead_paragraph":"Champagne was spraying all around him, and Dan Duquette couldn't help but laugh at the mayhem he helped create.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Orioles Clinch AL East With 8-2 Win Over Blue Jays","print_headline":"Orioles Clinch AL East With 8-2 Win Over Blue Jays"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-09-16T22:14:55Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Baseball","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"5418eed838f0d86afc9a0c2b","word_count":"829","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/09\/16\/sports\/football\/ap-fbn-qbs-head-or-feet-first.html","snippet":"When his quarterback takes off running, Tennessee Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt only worries if he picked up the first down and what play to call next.
