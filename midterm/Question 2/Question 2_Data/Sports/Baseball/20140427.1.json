Born Abraham Smolowitz on December 9th, 1915 in a LES tenement apartment to Jewish immigrants Ida and Sam Smolowitz. Mother Ida was a seamstress at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, but as fate would have it she stayed home to care for her ill sister the day the factory burned down. Ida went on to marry Sam Smolowitz. They had three children David, Abe and Dorothy. Abe spent his formative years in Bensonhurst. Intelligent and curious, Abe graduated from New Utrecht High School and went on to Brooklyn College. As a devoted son, Abe left university to help his father run the family store on Orchard Street. At 26, Abe enlisted in the army. He was a proud member and decorated officer of the 3158th Signal Core, 45th infantry division. Before going overseas, Abe married his girlfriend Jean Shankman on April 14th, 1943. Three years later Abe returned home to his wife and the family store, but eventually made his career as a traveling salesman and garment expert in the tri-state area. If you needed directions from Brighton Beach to Sleepy Hollow, Abe was your guy. Three children later, he and Jean were settled in Sheepshead Bay, where they happily remained until his death. A devoted man to family and friends, Abe was greatly engaged in his faith and his community. His extensive work with the Shore Park Jewish Center, B'Nai Brith, Brooklyn College Hillel, UJA and his 20 years of service with the Brooklyn Veterans Hospital will long outlive him. Keeping up with the weather, the news, and his responsibilities as a US citizen, Abe read the New York Times front to back every day, and always exercised his right to vote. He cast his last vote (November 2012) at 96 years old. He loved baseball, black cherry ice cream, going to shul, the beach, the state of Israel, a good bargain, a good movie, a good debate, and his grandchildren. His sharp mind and memory never left him. He is survived by his wife Jean, 93, his sister Dorothy, 94, nieces and nephews, cousins, his three children, Barbara Callaghan, Paul Small, Gay Abrams, five grandchildren, and four great- grandchildren. He adored his granddaughter Robin, who sadly predeceased him. Abe leaves a legacy of a strong moral compass and a life well-lived. The unveiling of his monument will take place this Sunday, April 27th at 11am at Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, New York.","abstract":null,"print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  SMALL, ABE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SMALL, ABE"}],"pub_date":"2014-04-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53c6e22238f0d858f3e37b91","word_count":"426","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/04\/27\/sports\/baseball\/ap-bba-red-sox-blue-jays.html","snippet":"A big win over the Boston Red Sox brought out a sense of national pride in the Toronto Blue Jays....","lead_paragraph":"A big win over the Boston Red Sox brought out a sense of national pride in the Toronto Blue Jays.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Dominican Lineup Leads Blue Jays Over Red Sox","print_headline":"Dominican Lineup Leads Blue Jays Over Red Sox"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-04-27T15:47:17Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Baseball","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"535d5ee638f0d8481d6f4ebf","word_count":"675","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/Link.asp?I=LS000170815952","snippet":"SMALL--Abe, died peacefully in his sleep on January 31st, 2013 in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn where he lived most of his 97 years.
