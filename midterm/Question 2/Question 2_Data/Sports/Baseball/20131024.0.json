On January 6, 1944, Thomas Francis Wynn III was born in St. Petersburg, Florida to Thomas and Catherine Wynn. Tom was the eldest of four children and he is survived by his brothers Jack and Bob and sister Kathy. Tom was raised in Fairlawn, New Jersey. His lifetime love for baseball started early with neighborhood games. And just like his idol Willie Mays, Tom \"The Jet\" played center field. Mr. Wynn was a graduate of Fordham University and Fordham Law School. He subsequently enlisted in the U.S. Army, served as Battalion Prosecutor and rose to the rank of Captain. In 1970 as Tom prepared to leave his station in Germany for the war in Vietnam, he received news that his wife of only one year, Linda Evelyn Gerbasi, had died following childbirth. Mr. Wynn was granted honorable discharge and he returned to the United States to find a job and care for his newborn twin girls Laura and Michele. Tom has always said that he was lucky enough to love two women in his life. On February 23, 1974, Ursula Claudina Loor married widower Tom Wynn; she adopted Tom's twin daughters and she gave birth to Thomas Loor Wynn IV and Ursula Mary Wynn. Ursula was the center of Tom's life for nearly 39 years of marriage whether on the dance floor or in the garden they were always together. On October 15, 2012 Ursula was called to the Kingdom of Heaven. Tom is survived by his children Thomas, Ursula and Laura. Michele predeceased both Tom and Ursula. Mr. Wynn is also survived by many friends and family members including his loving daughter-in-law Lysset Wynn and James Decker; and grandchildren Matthew, Thomas, Hank, Tammy and Luke. In 1970, Mr. Wynn joined the NASD Arbitration and Mediation Department (now part of FINRA) and most recently served as the Associate Director of Neutral Training and Development. Throughout his 34-year career, Mr. Wynn served in virtually every area of this department and, at various times, supervised the California, New York and Florida Offices. He was a frequent speaker at NASD and other seminars and developed training programs for Chairpersons. Tom was especially proud of his newsletter The Neutral Corner to which served as the Editor-in-Chief from its inception in 1995 until his retirement in 2004. With great humility, Tom described his role at the NASD as one that seemed to be \"created just for him.\" At his core, Mr. Wynn was principled, fair and transparent; and his life's work, therefore, was an expression of himself. On Saturday, October 19, 2013, the Lord granted Tom entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven. Following cremation, we will celebrate Tom's life during a Memorial Mass on Friday, October 25, 2013 at 10:00am in St. Ann's Catholic Church located in Nyack, New York. Finally we ask that in lieu of flowers, donations can be made in the memory of Thomas Francis Wynn III to the Joe Raso Hospice Residence at 415 Buena Vista Road, New City, New York, 10956.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  WYNN, THOMAS FRANCIS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WYNN, THOMAS FRANCIS"}],"pub_date":"2013-10-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"527319ed38f0d829b45e93c9","word_count":"504","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
