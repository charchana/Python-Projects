It is with great sorrow that we mourn the passing of Jeffrey Seth Gold, son of Theodore David and Debra (Fridovich), brother of William (Nili), uncle of Doria and Avitai (Jocelyn), and great-uncle of Elijah and Tali. In 1969, Jeff founded Community Tax Aid in New York, for which he received an award from Mayor Beame. For two years, Jeff served on the IRS Commissioner's Advisory Group. Jeff will be remembered as a dear family member, a loyal friend with a superior intellect, and as a true advocate for marginalized groups culminating in his efforts at the forefront of the anti-smoking movement. A gifted writer and editor, avid reader, accomplished hiker, baseball fan and traveler, Jeff will always be honored by those who knew him. Funeral service will be held at 9:30am on Friday, October 4th at Plaza Jewish Community Chapel, located at 630 Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The
