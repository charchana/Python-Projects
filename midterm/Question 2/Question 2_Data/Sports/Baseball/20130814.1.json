He was 83. Adored husband to Bernice (nee Steigman), beloved father to Steve (Shari) and Suzanne, loving grandfather to Elizabeth, Jack, and Sarah. Marty was born in Brooklyn on April 21, 1930, and attended James Madison High School. He graduated from New York University in 1951, and went on to serve as an Army Sergeant in the Korean War. After the war, he pursued his love of entertainment, working in an earlier era of New York City television and film production. He was the studio manager at Gold Medal Studios in Astoria, and served as production manager on a wide variety of films, including 'Butterfield 8,' and on television shows such as 'Naked City,' 'Car 54, Where Are You?' and 'Man of the House,' the pilot for 'The Dick Van Dyke Show.' He was introduced to his beloved 'Bunny' at a Columbia Pictures screening of 'The Goddess,' where she worked at the time. He left the industry in 1961 to become a New York City schoolteacher. He taught English and Film for over 25 years at Far Rockaway High School, where he served as Dean of Students, and at Susan Wagner High School. He inspired numerous students to pursue their own careers in the entertainment industry. After his retirement, he continued to share his lifelong passion for film and television, serving as an adjunct Professor of Communications at Mercer County College in New Jersey, and as a Featured Lecturer at the Maltz Jupiter Theatre in Florida. He passed along his love of photography, baseball, film, television, and the ability to tie a perfectly dimpled four-in-hand tie knot to his children and grandchildren. His quiet dignity masked a sly sense of humor, and he will be deeply missed by us all. Funeral services will be held graveside at Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing on Wednesday, August 14 at 1:30pm. The family will be sitting shiva at 78 Barkers Point Road in Sands Point on Wednesday, August 14 from 5 to 8pm, and on Thursday, August 15 from 1 to 8pm. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls.org).","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  LEICHTER, MARTIN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LEICHTER, MARTIN"}],"pub_date":"2013-08-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"52157f2238f0d8740ac9a58e","word_count":"377","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/Link.asp?I=LS000166422219","snippet":"LEICHTER--Martin, passed away on August 12 at Robert Wood Johnson Hospital in New Brunswick after a 3-year battle with Myelodysplasia.
