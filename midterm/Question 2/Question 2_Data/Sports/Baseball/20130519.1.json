Cox, Jr., of Hobe Sound, FL and Nantucket, MA, passed away peacefully on May 1, 2013 surrounded by his family. He was 82. Bill was born on November 8, 1930 in Boston, Massachusetts to William C. Cox and Jessie Bancroft Cox. He was the great-grandson of Clarence Barron, the owner of the Boston News Bureau, who later acquired the Dow Jones news service in 1902. The Bancroft Family are the former owners of Dow Jones & Company Inc., publishers of The Wall Street Journal. Bill attended Dexter School in Brookline Mass, Brooks School in North Andover and Boston University. He served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. Bill's career at Dow Jones began in the late 1950s and would span over four-decades. In the 1960s he worked for the companys circulation services at their Chicopee, MA facility. While his career was spent on the business side of Dow Jones, he was a staunch supporter and steward of the journalistic integrity of the Wall Street Journal. In the 1970's, Bill moved to Detroit to be the mid-western advertising sales director of The Wall Street Journal. In 1976 Bill was elected to the Board of Directors of Dow Jones, a position he held for twenty-five years. In the 1980s he moved to London to help launch the European Edition of The Wall Street Journal. He returned to the United States in 1995 and served as the Journal's Executive Director of Client Relations, a position he held until his retirement in 2001. Growing up in Cohasset, MA, exposed to the equestrian world his parents loved, Bill realized his sporting interest lay outside of the riding ring. Much to his mother's consternation he never took to horses instead becoming an accomplished golfer, baseball player and ice hockey player, once being extended the opportunity to try out for the Boston Bruins. As a baseball player, he shared his mother's passionate support of the Red Sox. An avid golfer he cherished playing a round with friends or family. Bill was a long time member of the US Seniors Golf Association. He was also an accomplished outdoorsman who was equally at home in a Michigan duck blind or casting a plug for stripped bass and bluefish off Nantucket. Bill loved music and a good party. He especially enjoyed singing old Broadway show tunes or Cole Porter songs. Perhaps most notable was Bill's generous support to the communities in which he lived. He was a trustee emeritus of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation; trustee of The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; Board member of the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club and supporter of the Martin County Boys and Girls Club. As past president of The Sankaty Head Foundation, he took great pride in the Caddy Camp and its role in developing young men of character. Bill also served as a Commissioner for the Town of Jupiter Island, FL. Above all of his business, athletic, and philanthropic accomplishments, he was most proud of his family. He was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He is survived by his wife of 60 years; Martha W. Cox and their four children, William C Cox III, Ann Cox Bartram, Heidi Cox and Martha Cox Farrell, and 10 grandchildren, his sister Jane MacElree and his beloved dog Topper. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to The Nantucket Boys and Girls Club P.O. Box 269 Nantucket, MA 02554, The Nantucket Conservation Foundation P.O. Box 13, Nantucket, MA 02554 and the Sankaty Head Foundation, P.O. Box 875, Siasconset, MA 02564. Memorial Service will be 4pm, July 13, 2013 at St. Paul's Church in Nantucket.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  COX, WILLIAM C."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2013-05-19T02:14:46Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5214125a38f0d8740ac920ab","word_count":"609","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/Link.asp?I=LS000164866791","snippet":"WARE--John A., 71, of New York City, died on April 27, 2013 of complications related to leukemia.
