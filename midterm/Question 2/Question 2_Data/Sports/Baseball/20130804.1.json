Jr.,87, of Vero Beach, Florida, passed away on August 2, 2013, as a result of congestive heart failure. He was born on August 1, 1926 in Abington Memorial Hospital in suburban Philadelphia and was predeceased by his wife Barbara shortly before their 59th anniversary. He is survived by brother Bob of Wayne, PA, sons George III (Sally) of Atlanta and Barnes (Cammie) of Charlotte, grandchildren Barbara Roland (Andy), Tuck, Lawson, Barnes and Dillon, and great-grandchild Charlotte Roland. He is also survived by his loving fiance, Patsy Daniels of Vero Beach, FL and Raleigh, NC. George graduated with honors from William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia, where he earned nine varsity letters in football, basketball, baseball and track. He captained the baseball and basketball teams and set school and league records for points and rebounds. Upon graduation in June 1944, George entered the U.S. Navy and was sent to the Officer Training Unit (V-12) at the University of Louisville. In his two years there, he earned varsity letters in baseball, track and basketball and set university records for scoring and rebounding. In 1946 George transferred to Harvard, where he again participated in football, track and basketball. He set the college's scoring and rebounding records and was captain of the basketball team. He played in the East-West All-Star game in the old Madison Square Garden and was selected by the Boston Celtics as their first pick in the 1948 NBA draft. Instead of playing professional basketball, George went to law school at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1951 with honors and was an editor of the Law Review and a member of the Order of the Coif. In 1950 George married Barbara Barnes of Durham, North Carolina. After graduating from law school, he joined the law firm now known as Dechert LLC in Philadelphia. He became a partner eight years later, and his practice focused largely on trusts and estates. Over the years, he held a variety of administrative assignments and in 1984 was elected Chairman and CEO of the firm. He served as chairman of the Real Property, Probate and Trust Law section of the American Bar Association, the Pennsylvania Bar Association and the Philadelphia Bar Association. He served on the Pennsylvania Joint State Government Advisory Committee for many years, including as chairman. George was active with a number of corporate, civic and athletic organizations. He was a director of the West Company and several large private companies. For almost 40 years, he was a director of Abington Memorial Hospital. He was president of the Harvard Club of Philadelphia, a director of the Association of Harvard Alumni and president of the William Penn Charter School Alumni Association. He was a co-founder and director of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, president of the Eastern Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the first chairman of the Abington Township Environmental Control Committee, and president of the Meadowbrook School. George was a member of Pine Valley Golf Club (NJ), the Honorable Company of EdinburghGolfers (Muirfield, Scotland), Huntingdon Valley Country Club (PA), John's Island Club (FL), Roaring Gap Club (NC) and the U.S. Seniors Golf Association. He served on the boards of Pine Valley, Roaring Gap, John's Island and the USSGA. George was also a member of the Union League of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Racquet Club and the Philadelphia Club. George was elected to the Athletic Hall of Fame at William Penn Charter School, University of Louisville and Harvard University. George's entire family loved travel as well as sports, and he visited more than 60 different countries on five continents. In Vero Beach, where George and Barbara moved in 1991, their principal interests were golf, Community Church of VB, Riverside Theatre, Vero Beach Art Museum, and Indian River Memorial Hospital. A memorial service will be held at the Community Church of Vero Beach on Wednesday, August 14th at 2:00pm. Following the church service, a reception will be held at the John's Island Club. A later graveside service in NC will be private. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Community Church of Vero Beach, 1901 23rd Street, Vero Beach, FL 32960 or Abington Memorial Hospital, 1200 Old York Road, Abington, PA 19001, or the charity of your choice.
