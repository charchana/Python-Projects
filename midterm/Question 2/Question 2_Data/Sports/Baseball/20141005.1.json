John \"Jack\" William Sullivan, 95, passed away peacefully at his home in Wilbraham, Massachusetts on September 23, 2014 with family and loved ones by his side after a brave fight against cancer. He was born in Johnson City, New York, in 1919 and was a star athlete at Johnson City High School before attending Colgate University, where he received a B.A. Summa Cum Laude and an M.A. in English. He loved Colgate and was proud to have played on the baseball team and the football team with Andy Rooney; he was captain of a strong basketball team that featured All American Ernie Vandeweghe. He was the last surviving member of the 1943 Phi Gamma Delta pledge class. As was true for many of his classmates, his time at Colgate was interrupted by service in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was in the Pacific and European theatres and was a Captain and Operatives Officer of the 52nd AAA Brigade in Europe. Following his graduation from Colgate, he was a high school teacher and coach before he entered the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he served as a Special Agent for almost 30 years. He was predeceased by his wife Claire Welch and four brothers and sisters. He is survived by his son John (Jay) William Jr., his daughter-in-law Jane Hemenway Sullivan, and two grandchildren, Elizabeth Caroline and John William III, all of New York City. He was a loving grandfather, engaging storyteller, lover of poetry and dear neighbor and friend. We will miss him dearly.
