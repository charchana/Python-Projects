Among them, a user could nod to turn the glasses on or off. A single wink might tell the glasses to take a picture.\n \nBut don\u2019t expect these gestures to be necessary for long. Soon, we might interact with our smartphones and computers simply by using our minds. In a couple of years, we could be turning on the lights at home just by thinking about it, or sending an e-mail from our smartphone without even pulling the device from our pocket. Farther into the future, your robot assistant will appear by your side with a glass of lemonade simply because it knows you are thirsty.","abstract":"Nick Bilton Disruptions column discusses emerging technology called brain computer interface, which will allow people to interact with their smartphones and computers simply by using their minds.
