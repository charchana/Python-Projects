He was born in New York City to Frank C. and Anna H. Page. Growing up mostly in Lawrence, NY. He was a champion diver at the Lawrence Beach Club and started his lifelong love affair with golf at the Rockaway Hunting Club, where he won the Junior Boys Championship in 1939. He attended Milton Academy and then Harvard University, class of '43. At Harvard, he was manager of the football team, helping the coaches diagram plays from high atop the stadium. After Harvard, he joined the army, and on completion of basic training at Camp Hood, served at the Pentagon and then in Honolulu, and was honorably discharged as a second lieutenant. In 1949, he joined the then Hewitt Ogilvy Benson and Mather as Treasurer with 'twelve other optimistic souls in a ratty office on Madison Avenue.' As Ogilvy and Mather grew, he missed the unstructured confusion and easy camaraderie of a startup, but was proud of being a part of what he called, 'the best international advertising agency in the world.' In 1950, he met the wonderful Roberta Raworth, and they married in 1951. Their son Frank was born in 1957. During the 60's and 70's, he was a member of the board and treasurer of the Rockaway Hunting Club in Lawrence, NY and became President of the Lawrence Beach Club. Shelby retired from Ogilvy and Mather as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in 1983 after 34 years. At the time, a colleague wrote that he was a 'source of good fun, inspiration, and integrity for all of us' at Ogilvy and Mather. In 1987, Shelby and Robby moved to Hilton Head where Shelby continued to play golf as a member of the Bear Creek Golf Club and bridge with his buddies from Long Cove, Bear Creek, and Cyprus. He also enjoyed travel, cruising to six of the seven continents. In Hilton Head, he participated in Meals on Wheels and supported Volunteers in Medicine and the Deep Wells Project. Throughout his life, he continued to support his schools, Milton and Harvard, as well as quite a number of humanitarian and environmental charities. Shelby will be remembered for his judgment, courage, and his contempt for dishonest argument. An Ogilvy and Mather board of directors' resolution declared him 'a gentleman with brains.' His kindness, integrity, and friendship will be missed by all. He was preceded in death by his loving wife, Roberta Page and brother Allison Page. He is survived by his sister, Cecilia Bourget, son, Frank Page, daughter in law, Ingrid Page, and grandson, Walter Page. Services will be private. The Island Funeral Home and Crematory is in charge of services. <a href=\"http:\/\/theislandfuneralhome.com\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"nofollow\">theislandfuneralhome.com<\/a>.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  PAGE, SHELBY H."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2013-11-22T01:12:26Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"528f2b2638f0d852f7e81552","word_count":"462","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
