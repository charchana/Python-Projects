He attended the Power Memorial Academy High School and graduated from Iona College in 1954. He worked for the Associated Press before beginning his distinguished career at Newsweek, where he dedicated himself to advancing the magazine's award-winning photojournalism. Jim was a sharp-witted conversationalist with a wide variety of interests; he loved nature and the outdoors, and was an avid golfer and fan of the Mets and football Giants.
