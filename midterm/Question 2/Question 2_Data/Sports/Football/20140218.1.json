He was 94. Dorfman was only 15 when he went to work as a high school sports correspondent for the Morning Ledger, predecessor to The Star-Ledger. Three years later, in 1938, at the behest of The Star-Ledger, he took over an independent bureau in Newark that was providing the newspaper with coverage of local sports and news. He would run it for the next 76 years. Today, that bureau, Dorf Feature Service, continues to service The Star-Ledger, its sister regional New Jersey newspapers, and its digital property, NJ.com, with what has long been regarded as the most comprehensive high school sports coverage in the country. In addition to chronicling the accomplishments of student-athletes and coaches, Dorfman wrote a general sports column for The Star-Ledger and won numerous writing awards. In 1998, he was inducted into the New Jersey Sports Hall of Fame. Early in his career, while also running Dorf Feature Service, he was a makeup editor and sat on the sports copy desk at The Star-Ledger. He also covered boxing and became the newspaper's first golf writer. As a general sports columnist, he wrote frequently on local and national amateur and professional sports. He retired as a columnist only several months ago due to declining health. Dorfman influenced generations of journalists who started their careers at Dorf Feature Service. The bureau's versatile coverage also included New Jersey college sports, town news, education, harness and thoroughbred racing, amateur and professional golf and tennis, New Jersey society, and obituaries. In the 1970s, he successfully campaigned for a high school football playoff system that would identify sectional state champions on the field of play, replacing ranking systems that declared champions on the basis of mathematical formulas. He also pushed for a realignment of high school sports conferences to promote a more fair and demographically balanced competitive environment. Led by Dorfman, The Star-Ledger was the first newspaper in the metropolitan area to provide comprehensive coverage of girls' high school sports. He also introduced Top 20 team rankings and All-State honor teams to the coverage. Dorfman, a former president of the New Jersey Sports Writers Association and a recipient of its Distinguished Service Award, was inducted into the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1999. The NJSIAA isstate's governing body of high school sports. Surviving are his wife, Marianne; his daughter, Rhoda; his son, Gary, and his wife, Marianne Dorfman; his son, Joseph; his grandson, Scott, and his wife, Elana Dorfman; and grandchildren, Jessica Dorfman and Lael Dorfman. Sid was also predeceased by his grandson, Jason. Services will be held Tuesday at 1pm at Temple Beth AhmYisrael, 60 Temple Drive, Springfield, NJ. Services are by BernheimApterKreitzman Funeral Chapel, Livingston, NJ.","abstract":null,"print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice:
