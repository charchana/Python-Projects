He was 91. As a senior apparel buyer at Macy's in the late 1950's, Mr. Wolfson was a member of the first team of retailers that traveled to Asia to successfully source import apparel programs to the US. In the 1970s, while President of the Netco apparel division of Zayre, he devised breakthrough models of distribution center efficiency well before the advent of automated warehouse equipment. As the increase of import apparel programs created overages too large for conventional retailers to handle, he then conceived the model for TJ Maxx, the first retail chain to specialize in closeout apparel. Mr. Wolfson was a US Government advisor on the retail textile industry since 1982, and in 1990 he formed Monte Wolfson Associates, a retail consulting firm. Mr Wolfson was born and raised in the Bronx, son of Irving and Helen Wolfson: he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1941. In the fall of 1941 he attended the University Of Illinois and participated in their ROTC program. In 1942 he was called into active service in the United States Army and was stationed at Ft. Sills, Oklahoma. He was honorably discharged and returned to the University of Illinois in 1944, where he earned his B.S. degree. He later earned an M.B.A. from New York University. In addition to his passion for business, he loved sports, theater and history; citing Willie Mays, William Shakespeare and Barbara Tuchman as three of the people he most admired. He was an avid tennis player known for his wicked cross-court forehand, and a long time member of the East Hampton Tennis Club. He enjoyed traveling, skiing with his family, and rooting for his beloved Knicks, Football Giants and Mets. In 1981 he was honored by The City Of Hope Medical Center and received their 'Spirit Of Life' award. Mr Wolfson's wife of 47 years, the former Doris Elaine Hertz, died in 2000. He is survived by their three children, Robert, Suzanne and Jon; Jon's wife Katherine; grandchildren Jayne, Tom, Grace and Lena; sister Muriel Oppenheimer; nephews Michael and David Oppenheimer; niece Amy Oppenheimer and his loving companion Laurel Isaacs. Memorial service Wednesday, July 9th, 4:30pm at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, New York City.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  WOLFSON, MONTE "},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-07-06T02:14:41Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53c0543038f0d871b1c31f8c","word_count":"404","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9403E2DC163AF935A35754C0A9629D8B63","snippet":"CASPER--Laurence.92, New York, died peacefully surrounded by his family on June 24.

Adoring father of Pamela with his first wife Selma, and doting father of Nicole and Hillary with beloved wife Brett of 37 years, proud grandfather of Sebastian and Viola, cherished father-in-law, brother-in-law and uncle. Graduated Boys High in Brooklyn at 16, kicked out of Brooklyn College where he was too engrossed in the library studying his own choice of books, but not before winning the boxing championship! He served proudly in the Army Air Corps in WWII as an officer and bombardier navigator with the B-24 Liberators, received his BA at Kent State under the GI bill. At the NYU Institute of Fine Arts he melded his passion of history and art. His expertise in sculpture, graphics and paintings stretched from Old Masters to contemporary art. Prior to founding Casper Fine Arts & Appraisals, Inc., he joined the Danenberg Galleries and ACA Gallery as Director of Exhibitions and served as President of the Appraisers Association of America. With his insight, intellect and profound understanding of art aesthetics, he initiated fresh interest in the early American modernists: John Marin, Charles Burchfield, Georgia O'Keefe and Joseph Cornell. In '68, he pioneered an exhibition of Norman Rockwell, signaling a shift in the art world's view of him from illustrator of the Saturday Evening Post to fine artist. This pivotal exhibition was shown in ten museums around the country. He remained committed to championing Rockwell's work and was sought for his expert opinion on the artist's paintings and market. His presence on Madison Avenue, in the great auction houses and museums, was highly respected. Ever the teacher, he generously shared his time and knowledge. He cultivated an interest in medicine with such zeal, ordering tests and analyzing results, that doctors often thought he was a doctor himself. His attorney father discouraged him from pursuing law, but he successfully represented his clients in litigation proceedings, advised their attorneys, gave expert testimony in US Tax Court, and most recently represented his wife against the injustices of parking violations. Even in his nineties, he could be found studying Russian and Japanese on tape. A true renaissance man, his overflowing library contains tomes on history, medicine, law, art, Jewish humor, bridge, philosophy, chemistry, astronomy and more. A football, soccer, baseball, golf, wrestling aficionado, he was a men's singles tennis champ, beating men 20 years his junior. He relished being a father, overcome with emotion each time he spoke of his daughters; he wanted for them only what they would want for themselves. His profound generosity, sensitivity, stubbornness, humor, openness, honesty and utmost integrity touched those around him; he was cherished and will be deeply missed by all.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  CASPER, LAURENCE.92"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CASPER, LAURENCE.92"}],"pub_date":"2014-07-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53c3487b38f0d8297e22decb","word_count":"451","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/07\/06\/sports\/soccer\/ap-soc-wcup-germany-rough-brazil.html","snippet":"Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger thinks Brazil has crossed the line with some of its hard tackling ahead of the World Cup semifinals and is urging referees to keep a closer eye on the host team....","lead_paragraph":"Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger thinks Brazil has crossed the line with some of its hard tackling ahead of the World Cup semifinals and is urging referees to keep a closer eye on the host team.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Germany Concerned About Roughness of Brazil","print_headline":"Germany Concerned About Roughness of Brazil"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-07-06T12:03:13Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Soccer","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"53b973d038f0d846adf43b3b","word_count":"377","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2014\/07\/06\/sports\/soccer\/06reuters-soccer-world-arg-dimaria.html","snippet":"If a scan on Sunday confirms Argentina midfielder Angel Di Maria is out of the World Cup it would be a significant blow to the South Americans' hopes of winning the tournament for the third time....","lead_paragraph":"If a scan on Sunday confirms Argentina midfielder Angel Di Maria is out of the World Cup it would be a significant blow to the South Americans' hopes of winning the tournament for the third time.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Di Maria Loss Would Be Hefty Blow for Argentina","print_headline":"Di Maria Loss Would Be Hefty Blow for Argentina"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-07-06T08:28:11Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Soccer","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"53b9411b38f0d84f485633b0","word_count":"409","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/Link.asp?I=LS000171626581","snippet":"CASPER--Laurence.92, New York, died peacefully surrounded by his family on June 24.
