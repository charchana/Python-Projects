He was a loyal friend to all those he knew, a terrific grandpa and a wonderful example of character to many. Steve was a loving companion to Barbara Freid Gottesman for the past 26 years, and with her he inherited a large family that he made his own. Of Steve, many said, simply, he was a gentle man and a gentleman. Steve, devoted son of the late Selma and Morton Wallach, was born in Orange, NJ, and attended Orange High School. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943, serving in the Atlantic, and was discharged as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in 1946. He graduated from Muhlenberg College after World War II. Steve spent nearly 40 years working for the US Shoe Corporation, where he was an executive in the sales department and is known for having mentored many young executives. He retired in 1991. Steve was a lifelong sports fan, particularly of the football Giants, and he was the most avid golfer. He is survived by his longtime companion Barbara, her three children, their spouses and eight grandchildren; a sister, Fran Weil, and a nephew, Bert Weil; and several great-nieces and a great-nephew. A funeral service will be held Tuesday at 10am at Menorah Chapels, 2950 Vauxhall Road, Union, NJ.
