A composer, arranger, musician and musical director, he worked in television, musical theater, jazz and classical venues. He wrote music for television sports including theme music for the National Football League, Atlanta Hawks basketball and for the 1988 and 1992 Olympic Games coverage. He performed as pianist on Broadway for the show, Eubie, and performed with many jazz greats. Off-Broadway he was musical director for five shows, including The Cotton Club Revisited. He wrote three orchestral works. Symphony No. 1 \"Shoah\" and a companion piece \"Testament\" were composed for and performed at The Shoah Concert in Berlin on February 4, 1994. Symphony No. 2, \"From Ashes Reborn\" was in part inspired by the protest of a Viet Nam War veteran. All three works were recorded in 1994 and 1995 by the Moscow Radio and Television Orchestra, led by Alexander Mikhailov. He is survived by his son, Zachary, and daughter, Julia, as well as his brother and sister-in-law, Brad and Jane Honoroff. A private memorial service will be held in July.","abstract":null,"print_page":"23","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  HONOROFF, RICHARD A."},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"HONOROFF, RICHARD A."}],"pub_date":"2014-06-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53c702ca38f0d858f3e38604","word_count":"185","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
