Passed away peacefully on May 22, 2013 at North Hill, in Needham MA. She was 100 years old and formerly lived in Dover, MA. The youngest child born into an academically distinguished family, Bunny was born January 7, 1913 in Minneapolis, MN, to Edith K. and Frank B. Rowley. She attended University High School in Minneapolis and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1934 with a Fine Arts degree specializing in sculpture. Bunny followed her father in aviation and as a UM freshman became one of the youngest pilots of her time, earning her pilots license in 1930 flying an open cockpit American Eagle bi-plane. Although socially quite shy, during football season she loved to fly over the UM campus dropping tickets to the games from her open cockpit. She flew extensively over the Midwest, relying on road maps and water towers for navigation. She graced the cover of \"The Aerologist Magazine\" in 1930. In 1936, the pretty Pi Beta Phi member earned an MA from the Minneapolis School of Design, specializing in sculpture. Bunny married Myles L. Mace in 1937 and they moved to Cambridge, MA where he attended the Harvard Business School until posted in England for military service in 1942. They had two sons, Myles L. Jr., (Nick) and Terrence R. and lived in Concord, then Weston MA. In 1955 the family moved to Beverly Hills, CA while Myles helped found Litton Industries. When Myles returned to teaching at Harvard Business School in 1958, the Mace's moved to Dover, MA where they lived for 45 years. Bunny moved to North Hill in 2003 several years after Myles died. Intellectually curious, Bunny loved to travel. She arranged a series of family trips to Europe, and later an around the world adventure. Subsequently, she and Myles traveled extensively throughout the world. Her last trip, at age 89, taken with Nick and daughter-in-law Suzy, fulfilled her longtime wish to visit China. Recognized among Massachusetts horticultural societies for her extensive gardens and plant expertise, Bunny was an active member of the Garden Club of America, Noanett Garden Club and Winter Gardeners, receiving numerous awards for her impeccable gardens, arrangements, projects and displays. She was a long-standing member of The Country Club in Brookline, MA, the University Club in New York City and the Ekwanok Country Club in Manchester, VT. She leaves behind two sons, Myles, Jr. of Southport, ME and Terrence of Fox Island, WA, two granddaughters, Alexandra Abrahams of New York City and Alison Falk of Essex, MA, along with three great-grandchildren, Grace Abrahams, Peyton and Charlie Falk.
