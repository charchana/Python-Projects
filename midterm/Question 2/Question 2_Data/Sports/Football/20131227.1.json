He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Patti; his children Richard, Mary-Joan Buckley, and William; his grandchildren Kaitlyn Donovan, Will Buckley, Patsy Buckley, Aidan Donovan and Maureen Donovan. He was predeceased by his parents Thomas and Mary and his brother William. Born in New York, NY he attended Incarnation School in Washington Heights and Power Memorial High School. He went on to attend Colgate University where he played football and was a member of the Theta Chi fraternity. He graduated from Colgate in 1952 and was fondly known by his classmates as Duke. As an alumnus he was a member of Colgate's President's Club, a Maroon Citation recipient, a Wm. Brian Little Award recipient for distinguished service to the university and a member of the James B. Colgate Society. Following college he joined the US Navy and served on the USS Haynesworth as an officer during the Korean Conflict. Upon completion of his military service, Mr. Donovan enrolled in New York University's MBA program and earned a masters degree in 1957. His professional career started at Crucible Steel in Pittsburgh, PA. He went on to take a position at Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh, in its Municipal Sales and Trading department. He moved back to New York in 1962 as part of Mellon's expansion of its New York Municipal presence. Several years later he joined Lehman Brothers as a municipal sales person. In 1970 he joined Salomon Brothers Municipal Sales and Trading Department where he served as a sales manager. He was made a partner in 1979. He later left the sales and trading group to head-up the Municipal Finance Department, which he ran until 1987. During his time at Salomon Brothers, Mr. Donovan worked on many important public projects including the New York City fiscal crisis in the early Seventies where his efforts along with others staved off bankruptcy and fiscal collapse for the city. Mr. Donovan completed his career at Dean Witter Reynolds as the head of Municipal Finance, where he worked until his retirement in 1992. In retirement, he spent his time between his homes in Short Hills, NJ; Quogue, NY; and Hobe Sound, FL. He was a long time member of Canoe Brook Country Club in Summit, NJ; Westhampton Country Club in Westhampton Beach, NY; and Loblolly Pines in Hobe Sound, FL. Mr. Donovan served as the President of the Loblolly Bay Association during which time it merged with Loblolly Pines to form Loblolly. A Funeral Mass will be celebrated at St. Rose of Lima Church, 50 Short Hills Rd, Short Hills on Monday, December 30th at 11:15am. Interment at Quogue Cemetery, Quogue, NY will be on Tuesday at noon. Relatives and friends are invited to visit at Bradley, Smith & Smith Funeral Home, 415 Morris Ave, Springfield on Sunday, December 29th from 3 to 8pm.
