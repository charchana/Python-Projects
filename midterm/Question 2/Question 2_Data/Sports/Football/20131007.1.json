Christopher DeWitt Simmons, of Alexandria, Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts died on October 3, 2013, in his sleep. He is survived by his wife, Laura McIntosh Simmons, children Tucker McIntosh Simmons and Charlotte Bleecker Simmons, all of Alexandria, Virginia; his father, Richard DeLacey Simmons, former President of the Washington Post Company, also of Alexandria; his sister Robin Simmons Turner (Eric), niece Merrill and nephews Brooks and Griffin of Arlington, Virginia. Born on April 19, 1963, in Huntington, New York, Christopher was the son of Richard and the late Mary Bleecker Simmons. A gifted athlete, at Deerfield Academy, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, he was a member of the school's football and lacrosse teams. Christopher attended Duke University and received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in fine arts and art history from Tufts University. He also held a degree with a concentration in painting and drawing from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, receiving its highest artistic prize, The Boit Award, in his first year. Christopher was an inveterate traveler, visiting all seven of the world's continents. He was one of the first Americans to travel to China after Nixon's historic visit and to Vietnam in 1994. An accomplished artist, his travels were reflected in his art. Christopher's signature mixed media technique merged photography and painting, documenting the monochromatic landscape of Antarctica as poetically as the Soviet Pacific fleet in Vladivostok and the desert refuge of WWII American planes in Arizona. Galleries in Washington, DC, Los Angeles, New Jersey and New York City showed his work. Christopher was intimately involved in his children's lives much to their benefit. He was active in their sporting activities; including coaching his daughter's youth lacrosse team and expanding his son's winning club swim team. Christopher devoted a significant effort to fundraising for Saint Stephens and St. Agnes School, Alexandria, Virginia and Washington DC's St. John's College High School. He was a member of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Belle Haven Country Club, Farmington Country Club and the Mill Reef Club. A memorial service will be held Tuesday, October 8, at 1pm, at the historic St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Alexandria, Virginia. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that Christopher be memorialized with contributions to the American Heart Association and the Lung Cancer Alliance.<br><br>\n ","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  SIMMONS, CHRISTOPHER D."},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2013-10-07T02:15:03Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5252781838f0d81989740b56","word_count":"382","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/10\/07\/us\/republicans-put-forth-ugly-image.html","snippet":"Republicans in Congress have no clear endgame to the current shutdown crisis, and the right-wing Tea Party element in the rank and file has run roughshod over the party leadership....","lead_paragraph":"Republicans in Congress have no clear endgame to the current shutdown crisis, and the right-wing Tea Party element in the rank and file has run roughshod over the party leadership.","abstract":null,"print_page":"","blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Republicans Put Forth Ugly Image","kicker":"Letter From Washington","print_headline":"Republicans Put Forth Ugly Image","content_kicker":"Letter From Washington"},"keywords":[{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","value":"National Debt (US)","name":"subject"},{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","value":"Federal Budget (US)","name":"subject"},{"rank":"8","is_major":"N","value":"Obama, Barack","name":"persons"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","value":"House of Representatives","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"9","is_major":"N","value":"Gingrich, Newt","name":"persons"},{"rank":"7","is_major":"N","value":"Republican Party","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)","name":"subject"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","value":"Tea Party Movement","name":"subject"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","value":"Shutdowns (Institutional)","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2013-10-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"firstname":"Albert","middlename":"R.","lastname":"HUNT","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ALBERT R.
