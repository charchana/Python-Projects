He is survived by daughters Elizabeth, Theresa, and Patricia; predeceased by his beloved wife Frances and son James. He was born in Manhattan on March 19, 1932 to Delia and Andrew Kenney. He attended the Power Memorial Academy High School and graduated from Iona College in 1954. He worked for the Associated Press before beginning his distinguished career at Newsweek, where he dedicated himself to advancing the magazine's award-winning photojournalism. Jim was a sharp-witted conversationalist with a wide variety of interests; he loved nature and the outdoors, and was an avid golfer and fan of the Mets and football Giants. He will be deeply missed by colleagues and friends, who fondly remember his laughter, warmth, and easygoing manner. His loved ones invite remembrances to be posted at Legacy.com.","abstract":null,"print_page":"31","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  KENNEY, JAMES JOSEPH"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KENNEY, JAMES JOSEPH"}],"pub_date":"2013-12-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"52afcc4f38f0d804c251c8ca","word_count":"159","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/12\/09\/us\/travel-snarled-on-east-coast-in-a-blast-of-snow-and-sleet.html","snippet":"Snow and freezing rain hit the East Coast on Sunday, causing flight cancellations and dangerous road conditions....","lead_paragraph":"Snow and freezing rain hit the East Coast on Sunday, causing flight cancellations and dangerous road conditions.","abstract":"Snow and freezing rain hits the East Coast, causing flight cancellations and dangerous road conditions; emergency officials across the region caution drivers to stay off roads.","print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":190,"url":"images\/2013\/12\/09\/us\/09weather2-web\/09weather2-web-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2013\/12\/09\/us\/09weather2-web\/09weather2-web-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2013\/12\/09\/us\/09weather2-web\/09weather2-web-articleLarge.jpg","height":400,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2013\/12\/09\/us\/09weather2-web\/09weather2-web-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"400"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2013\/12\/09\/us\/09weather1-web\/09weather1-web-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2013\/12\/09\/us\/09weather1-web\/09weather1-web-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Travel Snarled on East Coast in a Blast of Snow and Sleet","print_headline":"Travel Snarled on East Coast In a Blast of Snow and Sleet"},"keywords":[{"rank":"5","is_major":"N","value":"Aviation Accidents and Safety","name":"subject"},{"rank":"8","is_major":"N","value":"Dallas (Tex)","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"1","is_major":"Y","value":"Snow and Snowstorms","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Roads and Traffic","name":"subject"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","value":"National Weather Service","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"7","is_major":"N","value":"Pennsylvania","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","value":"Weather","name":"subject"},{"rank":"6","is_major":"N","value":"New Jersey","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"9","is_major":"Y","value":"Northeastern States (US)","name":"glocations"}],"pub_date":"2013-12-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"firstname":"Emma","middlename":"G.","lastname":"FITZSIMMONS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By EMMA G.
