He drew a lot of interest around the league, reportedly meeting with the 49ers, Seahawks and Raiders all last week before deciding on a shorter move and signing with the Giants. The entire Eagles defense struggled last season and Jenkins finished with only 26 total tackles and four sacks, but in 2011, he had 40 tackles and 5.5 sacks. He is primarily a run-stuffing interior lineman who can also help a pass rush. He was an anchor of the Packers\u2019 defense when Green Bay won the Super Bowl after the 2010 season.","abstract":"NFL Roundup; New York Giants confirm signing of former Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins for a reported $8 million over three years.
