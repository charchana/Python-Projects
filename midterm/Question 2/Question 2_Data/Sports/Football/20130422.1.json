DAVID -->DAVID-Dr. David Salim, of Beverly Hills, CA passed away peacefully at home on Friday, April 19. He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Vera David, PhD; his daughter, Lisa David and granddaughter, Veronica David; his son, Eric (Lacy) David, MD and grandsons Simon and Nathaniel David; his brother Sami David, MD, and sister Karen Chilowicz; and numerous nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his brother Dr. Harry David, MD. Born in Baghdad in 1938, he immigrated with his family to New York City, arriving in 1948. He completed his undergraduate degree at Columbia College, received an MD from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and completed his residency in internal medicine at St. Luke's Medical Center, where he was chief resident. He was subsequently attending physician and faculty member at New York Hospital\/Cornell Medical Center and the Rogosin Institute in the departments of medicine, surgery and biochemistry. A nephrologist who published more than 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals, he was a member of the team of professionals who cared for the first dialysis and kidney-transplant patients in New York. After moving to Los Angeles, Dr. David was a nephrologist and internist in private practice and a clinical professor of medicine at UCLA School of Medicine. Dr. David was revered as a stellar practitioner of clinical medicine and beloved by his patients, who sought him out for his intuitive and compassionate care. As a boy in Baghdad, Dr. David exercised daily by swimming across the Tigris River; in the US, he played placekicker for the Columbia College football team and served in the United States Army Reserves, from which he was honorably discharged following a brief call to active duty. He was devoted to his family and adored as husband, brother, father, and grandfather, as well as beloved uncle and cousin to the many generations of his family members across the country.
