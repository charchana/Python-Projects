He was 77 years old. Jon was born to William and Dorothy Anderson on March 13, 1936, on St. Urbain Street, the main drag of Montreal's immigrant district, home to many writers including Saul Bellow and Mordecai Richler. In 1952, he graduated from Westmount High School, sharing with Leonard Cohen an English teacher who taught them both how to \"write tight.\" Inspired by an uncle, Johnny Walsh, a legendary crime reporter in Montreal, he started in journalism by describing contentious town council meetings for the Sackville Tribune-Post while completing a Bachelor of Arts degree (1955) at Mount Allison University. Before graduating from McGill University Law School in 1959, he reported for the Montreal Gazette, covering everything from theater to political riots. In 1960, he became Montreal bureau chief for TIME, an assignment that triggered a Mafia death threat for his coverage of their local crimes. Transferred by TIME to Chicago in 1963, he contributed to major stories on football star Jim Brown, archaeologist Nelson Glueck and the murder of eight student nurses. He later worked for the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Daily News, Chicago Tribune and Second City. In 1991, he earned a Master of Arts degree in non-fiction writing from the University of Iowa. His book, \"City Watch: Discovering the Uncommon Chicago,\" was published by the University of Iowa Press. Survivors include his wife and sweetheart, Pamela Sherrod Anderson, of Chicago; three beloved children, Ashley Prentice Norton of New York, Abra Williams of San Francisco and Anthony Anderson of Los Angeles; seven grandchildren, and a brother, Derek Anderson of Montreal. A son, Jon Gregory Anderson, predeceased him in 1999. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be sent to Rush University Medical Center, Chappell Fund\/ Hematology, 1700 W. Van Buren St., Suite 250, Chicago, IL 60612, or the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN for multiple myeloma research. A wake will be held Sunday, January 19th, 4-8pm at Saint Gertrude's Church, 1420 Granville Ave., Chicago. A funeral service will take place at St. Gertrude's Monday January 20th at 10am.","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  ANDERSON, JON STEPHEN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ANDERSON, JON STEPHEN"}],"pub_date":"2014-01-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"52e488bf38f0d8749cf470d8","word_count":"359","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/reuters\/2014\/01\/18\/sports\/soccer\/18reuters-soccer-england-sunderland.html","snippet":"Relegation-threatened Sunderland salvaged a point from a 2-2 draw with Southampton after trailing 2-0 in the first half at the Stadium of Light on Saturday....","lead_paragraph":"Relegation-threatened Sunderland salvaged a point from a 2-2 draw with Southampton after trailing 2-0 in the first half at the Stadium of Light on Saturday.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Sunderland Inflict More Pain on Suffering Saints","print_headline":"Sunderland Inflict More Pain on Suffering Saints"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-01-18T09:52:15Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Soccer","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52da958938f0d8253f797b4d","word_count":"451","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.legacy.com\/Link.asp?I=LS000169155305","snippet":"ANDERSON--Jon Stephen, beloved husband, father and brother, passed away January 15, 2014 at Rush Hospital in Chicago, from complications of Multiple Myeloma.
