He was 91. As a senior apparel buyer at Macy's in the late 1950's, Mr. Wolfson was a member of the first team of retailers that traveled to Asia to successfully source import apparel programs to the US. In the 1970s, while President of the Netco apparel division of Zayre, he devised breakthrough models of distribution center efficiency well before the advent of automated warehouse equipment. As the increase of import apparel programs created overages too large for conventional retailers to handle, he then conceived the model for TJ Maxx, the first retail chain to specialize in closeout apparel. Mr. Wolfson was a US Government advisor on the retail textile industry since 1982, and in 1990 he formed Monte Wolfson Associates, a retail consulting firm. Mr Wolfson was born and raised in the Bronx, son of Irving and Helen Wolfson: he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1941. In the fall of 1941 he attended the University Of Illinois and participated in their ROTC program. In 1942 he was called into active service in the United States Army and was stationed at Ft. Sills, Oklahoma. He was honorably discharged and returned to the University of Illinois in 1944, where he earned his B.S. degree. He later earned an M.B.A. from New York University. In addition to his passion for business, he loved sports, theater and history; citing Willie Mays, William Shakespeare and Barbara Tuchman as three of the people he most admired. He was an avid tennis player known for his wicked cross-court forehand, and a long time member of the East Hampton Tennis Club. He enjoyed traveling, skiing with his family, and rooting for his beloved Knicks, Football Giants and Mets. In 1981 he was honored by The City Of Hope Medical Center and received their 'Spirit Of Life' award. Mr Wolfson's wife of 47 years, the former Doris Elaine Hertz, died in 2000. He is survived by their three children, Robert, Suzanne and Jon; Jon's wife Katherine; grandchildren Jayne, Tom, Grace and Lena; sister Muriel Oppenheimer; nephews Michael and David Oppenheimer; niece Amy Oppenheimer and his loving companion Laurel Isaacs. Memorial service Wednesday, July 9th, 4:30pm at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, New York City.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  WOLFSON, MONTE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WOLFSON, MONTE"}],"pub_date":"2014-07-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"53c348a738f0d8297e22deed","word_count":"404","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2014\/07\/06\/sports\/soccer\/ap-soc-wcup-brazil.html","snippet":"Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari hinted in training Sunday that midfielder Willian is his first option to replace Neymar in Brazil's World Cup semifinal against Germany....","lead_paragraph":"Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari hinted in training Sunday that midfielder Willian is his first option to replace Neymar in Brazil's World Cup semifinal against Germany.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Scolari Hints Willian May Replace Neymar in Semis","print_headline":"Scolari Hints Willian May Replace Neymar in Semis"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2014-07-06T16:16:08Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":"Soccer","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"53b9aed438f0d846adf43b9b","word_count":"433","slideshow_credits":null}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
