Bruce was born in Chicago, IL on July 5, 1957 to his beloved parents, Virginia I Wrobel and the late Walter J Wrobel. After a very successful academic and athletic career at Evergreen Park High School in Evergreen Park, IL, Bruce went on to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he developed his passion for energy development, drove the establishment of a varsity football team after a 70-year hiatus, and formed many treasured and lifelong friendships. After receiving degrees in economics and resource management, Bruce cofounded MITEX Corporation, a hydropower company later sold to Sithe Energies. As a Sithe Energies executive and eventual Sithe Global Power CEO, Bruce was responsible for the identification and development of dozens of power plants throughout the world. Power plant development eventually took him to Africa where he fell in love with the people and became committed to addressing many of the challenges preventing African nations from overcoming poverty. Whether building power plants to deliver reliable energy and much needed jobs (SITHE GLOBAL), laying fiber optic cable on the ocean floor to enable global connectivity and access (SEACOM), or helping nations realize the full value of their natural resources (GAPCO), Bruce envisioned real solutions and worked tirelessly to secure the required funding and manage the projects through to completion.
