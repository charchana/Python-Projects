Born in Scarsdale, NY, Jim graduated from Cornell University where he received a football scholarship. He continued his education with an MBA from Columbia Business School and went on to have a successful and diverse career as an advertising and diamond industry executive before pursuing more entrepreneurial endeavors, creating web based development companies RestaurantRow. com and Mediaspa. Beyond his professional accomplishments, he was an avid golfer, valiant, generous, charitable and fiercely determined. Jim's greatest passion was his family: his wife Kathy, of almost 32 years, whom he married after only knowing for six weeks; his children Scott, Heather and Kody; daughter-in-law, Alison; granddaughter Skye; sister Ronny; and guardian cats, Redford and Brando. Jim will be deeply missed and in our hearts forever.
