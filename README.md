Introduction:

Enron Corp. is a company that reached dramatic heights, only to face a dizzying collapse.
The story ends with the bankruptcy of one of America's largest corporations. Enron's collapse affected the lives of thousands   of employees and shook Wall Street to its core. At Enron's peak, its shares were worth 90.75 dollar, but after the company declared   bankruptcy on December 2, 2001, they plummeted to 0.67 dollar by January 2002. To this day, many wonder how such a powerful business   disintegrated almost overnight and how it managed to fool the regulators with fake, off-the-books corporations for so long.
